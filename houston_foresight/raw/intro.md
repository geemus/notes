# W01: Introductions and Overview

## Reading: The Futures Field: Functions, Forms, and Critical Issues (Amara)

* Five basic functions: goals formulation, methods development, applications, coupling, and implementation.
* Institutional forms: image generators, research organizations, corporate planning groups, and citizen groups.
* Futures field: Any systematic attempt to improve our understanding of the future consequences of present developments and choices.
  * Broken into three categories: exploration of possible futures (art of futurism), exploration of probable futures (science of futurism), and exploration of preferable futures (politics and psychology of futurism).
* General Features of the present Futures Field:
  * Visionary: integrative and strategic, generally more than 5 years, and often 20 or more years into the future
  * Analytical: multidisciplinary and methodological with emphasis on explictness in forecasting, modelling, scenario building, and related activities
  * Participatory: problem and implementation-oriented with particular attention to social and political dimensions
* Functions or Roles:
  * Goal formulation: issue or problem definition; future-image creation or alternative futures generation. Ties to visionary, least explicit, most intuitive, and most personal.
  * Methods development: includes developing body of explicit, organized knowledg about event and trend forecasting, process modelling, and data integration. Together with applications, stems from analytical or research components.
  * Applications: provide inputs to planning and decision-making by expanding range of useful alternatives, evaluating consequences, and structuring intervention. May or may not involve formal methodologies.
  * Coupling: socio-psychological and organizational aspects of information transfer to influence individual perceptions, behavior, and attitudes. Taken together with implementation, coupling is at the participatory roots of the Futures Field.
  * Implementation: interventions and actions actually token to realize objectives of a plan, and the informative feedback that may lead to changes in plans.
* Major groups/institutions (~150 total):
  * Goal setters or "image generators" (50-60) - highly imaginative image-oriented thinking.
  * Research organizations (25-30) - focus on applications-oriented activities and often methodology.
  * Corporate or government plannig groups (50) - focus on coupling activities, usually not directly involved in research.
  * Citizen groups (10-25) - interested public, often not directly affiliated with futures field.
* Circuit of the links among functions:
  * Goals-Methods: Weak connectivity. Unlikely that goals will influence methods, but methods could potentially influence goals. No existing forms focus on this link.
  * Methods-Applications: Best connected link, representing analytical and research arms.
  * Applications-Coupling: Poor connectivity. This absence of effective mechanism for coupling research to end users is a critical institutional problem for the futures field. No known related institutions exist.
  * Coupling-Implementation: Week to non-existent link. Citizen groups have raised awareness (coupling), but struggled with implementation. Emerging institutional forms may help bridge the gap.
  * Implementation-Goals: largely undefined and uncharted. Visionary goals and implementation seem at odds with one another. Unclear how to bridge this gap.
* Researchable Issues
  * Institutional Effectiveness - could use clearer measures of how effective output is and what biases may have gone into it.
  * Integration of Approaches - could use a unified theory of how things fit together.
  * Understanding social change - need to better understand and be able to describe at the societal level.
  * Research to users - need to characterize and understand micro (individual level) process of change and how to foster/realize change.
* Likely marks made by Futures Field:
  * deeper understanding of social change processes at macro and micro levels
  * more effective qualitative (judgmental) and quantitative (analytical) components in planning
  * more balance multidisciplinary planning with social sciences partnerning with physical and analytical sciences

## Reading: A Way through the Maze: what futurists do and how they do it (Garrett)
## Reading: What corporations do with foresight (Hammoud & Nash)

* Foundations:
  * Macro historians: Hegel, Marx, Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin
  * Utopianists, philosophers, sociologists: More, Condorcet, Saint-Simon, Comte
* charting sweeping change through social systems
* we are not able to collect future facts, but we can collect future images
* we think about the future with the same brain parts that we use to think about the fast
* pasts, presents, futures; hopes, fears, extrapolation, imagination
* Early post WW2 Futurists
  * European - focus on rebuilding; philosophical and visionary approach; via images, visioning, planning, and la prospective
  * USA - focus on resource allocation and production; quantitative, technical, and method based approach; via system modelling, delphi, and scenarios
  * Socialist Economies - focus on central economy planning; econometric forecasting approach; via quantitative, trend extrapolation, and goal-based forecasting
  * Developing world - focus on nation building; visioning, econometrics, and post modernism approaches; via planning ,trend extrapolation, and critical analysis
* two conflicting images of the future emerged
  * technical optimists; such as Herman Kahn and The Year 2000, 1967
  * environmental doomsayers and neo-Malthusians: The Club of Rome's Limits to Growth systems model, Dennis and Donella Meadows, 1972.
* followed later by: spiritual tranformation, high technology transformation/transhumanism, collapse (political, economic, environmental)

* futures disturb the present, as assumptions that the world in 10 years will be like it was 10 years ago.
* alternative possible futures
  * reality is non-linear, creating a chaotic and unpredictable system
  * possible futures emerge from the turbulent interplay of emerging change with our complex, evolving selves and societies
* alternative possible futures - there are many possibilities, some are more probable than others, we can track probabilities by monitoring trends, some possibilities are more preferable
* 5 thinking modes: creative, logical, systemic, critical, intuitive-empathetic
* 5 foresight activities: identify and monitor change, map and critique impacts, imagine alternative outcomes, envision preferred futures, organize and act to create change

# W02: History of Futures Studies and Foresight

## Reading: History of Futures (Schultz)

* Five waves of futures work
  * Oral Tradition: shamans and mystics embedded in deep myths.
  * Early Written Age: early macrohistorians, looking for patterns in the past and cycles of repitition.  * Extraction and Enlightenment: progress through science, technology, and rationalism. Foten leading to tension between images of techonology and environment.  * Systems and Cybernetics: growing hand-in-hand with systems thinking as a sister science in response to the Great Depression and support of the Second World War.
  * Complexity and Emergence: shifting toward deeper understanding of hidden social and cultural determinents of our futures.

## Reading: Future Studies: A New Field of Inquiry (Bell)

* Much work came out of response/recovery from WW2.
  * Some focusing around nation formation and nation building.
  * Some focusing around military planning and scenarios (wrt cold war).
* Lots of work tied up with government, defense, etc that were classified or otherwise not publicly accessible.
* Much of this came to a head amidst protests/etc of Vietnam war and cival rights.
* Commission of the Year 2000 came together, starting in 1965, to try and formalize futures and bring them to civilian interests.
* Limits to Growth (1972) and the Club of Rome, predicted an end to population and industrial growth in the next century. It outlined a number of possibilities, though continued unrestricted growth was not among them. The rest depended on the choices we would make.
* H.D. Lasswell and Policy Sciences, beginning in 1930s. Warned of society in which specialists on violence would become the most powerful group.
  * Outlined five specific tasks for study of the future: clarification of goals and values, description of trends, explanation of conditions, projection of possible and probable futures under current policies, and invention/evaluation/selection of policy alternatives to achieve preferred goals.
  * Established policy sciences as identifiable, respectable, even desirable professional activity
  * Future studies aims to view future as an open horizon to creatively explore, whereas policy studies tend to try and "de-futurize" the future to increase security.
* Evaluation Research - originally evaluate goverment programs to see if they achieved their goals, and who/what was responsible for success/failure. Now includes prospective as well as retrospective aspects.

## Reading: Reconceptualizing Futures (Masini)

* How can we move from abstractly looking into the future to actually building the future?
* As we navigate toward desirable futures, we must ask on what basis we decide what is desirable.
* Three levels of looking at the future, representing three different philosophical approaches:
  * "something is changing" - "prognosis" Look at data of the past and present to point the way toward what is possible and identify what is probable. Relies on extrapolating from social, economic and other indicators. Relates to philosphy of John Locke.
  * "something MUST be changed" - "visions" Aspire to transform the present by a vision of the future. Instead of probables, this approach focuses on desirables. Relates to philosophy of Leibnitz.
  * "something CAN be changed" - "projects" Combines knowledge of possibles/probables and a vision of desirables. This acknowledges the interest of the observer. Possibly relating to non-Western philosophies.
* "visions" approach often relies on existing visions of writers, poets, political scientists, philosophers, policy-makers, etc. Perhaps instead it sholud develop it's own visions.
* The best listeners/capturers ar those somehow outside the logic of the specific system, as those inside it often have socialital charatacter become an assumed identity.
* Those who build visions identify that which is different that the present, but that is not pure utopia (since these do not occur historically).
* Visions built not only with rational capabilities, but also intuitive, imaginitive capacities.
* Any future one envisions will reflect social character and individual temperament, so it is important to include this openly and understandably. Furthermore, projects/visions should be made and shared by many diverse individuals to paint a more complete picture.
* Future projects are political and ethical positions that lead to action.
* Futurists must learn and help others to learn in future terms. This learning should be based on:
  * Awareness of the Interrelation Between Psychological and Social Character
  * Respect for One's Own Culture and at the Same Time Awareness of Other Cultures
  * Learning Should Be Geared to Identity
  * Learning Must Be Geared to the Ultimate Question of Existence (meaning of life). Not to answer these questions but to perceive the range of answers.

## Reading: Corporate Futures (Rohrbeck et al)

* Foresight is built on the assumptions that:
  * multiple futures are possible (due to uncertainty and unpredictability)
  * change (drivers) can be identified and studied
  * the future can be influenced
* Corporate Foresight is identifying, observing and interpreting factors that induce change, determining possible organization-specific implications, and triggering appropriate organizational responses. Corporate foresight involves relevant stakeholders and creates value through providing access to critical resources ahead of competition, preparing the organization for change, and permitting the organization to steer proactively toward a desired future.
* Historical Context:
  * 1950s - foresight work engaging experts vs prospective work which applies collaboratively directly with decision makers
  * 1960s and 1970s - scenarios provide systematic approaches to identifying key change drivers
  * 1980s and 1990s - professionalization with methods such as technology roadmapping and continuous environmental scanning.
  * 2000s+ - organizational integration of routines facilitating futures insights, though many firms struggle to translate this into action. Dilemma of needing large variety of data to be interpretted and a lack of time and attention span from leadership to engage.
* Decision-Making Routine vs Integrated Organizational Practice
* Current Studies: Organizing, Cognition, Network Organizations, Value Assessment
* Future Studies:
  * Managerial cognition - emphasizing the role of individual and group cognition in shaping perception and influencing decision-making.
  * Forward-looking search - emphasizes that individuals are bounded-rational, and therefore firm decision maknig cannot be conceptualized as purely rational or analytic reasoning.
  * Prospective sensemaking considers organizing as a process in which individuals build on past experiences, retrospectively and collectively reflect on these episodes, and through sustained interaction build converging cause maps that permit them to converge behind common objectives and lines of action.

## Reading: Historical Review of the Development of Future-Oriented Technology Assessment (Johnston)

* Forecasting and Foresight
  * relate to a transition to new approaches of social change based on deliberate intervention toward specified ends
  * initial focus around public policy, but quickly spreading to business generally large captila intensive ones with longer planning horizons.
  * gradual shift away from methodology-driven studies toward a variety of tools, each suitable for different purposes and with different strengths and limitations.
  * critical technologies forecasting centered on an assumption that certain identifiable technologies were key to future economic performance.
* Technology Assessment
  * seeks to asses potential and implications of emerging and future technologies

## Lecture

* much divination, as well as foresight, focus on identifying patterns of change * general systems theory - a system is a complex of interacting elements that are open to, and interact with their environments
* system dynamics - attempts to understand nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, and time delays (Limits to Growth Model)
* chaos theory - some systems have instability and nonlinear change processes
* complexity theory - describes self-organization, and adaptation and innovation to cause undpredictable change.

# W03: Theories of Change

## Reading: Macrohistory and Futures Studies (Inayatullah)

* Macrohistory is the study of the histories of social systems in search of patterns or even laws of social change.
* Looking at causes and mechanisms of historical change, what changes and what remains stable, analyzing units of history, and presenting stages of history all provide structure for forecasting and insight into the future.
* Tension in this view between structure/structuralism and agency/individualism/liberalism.
* Ideally a theory includes linear, cyclical and tracendenal dimensions and has agency, structure, and superagency (trancendental) causes of movement.
* As we consider individual's ability to influence, we must acknowledge this happens within a set of conditions that bias influence their ability to choose. Macrohistorians see these biases themselves as existing within structures and forming patterns.
* Cyclical theorists suggest limits which result in rise and fall. Linear suggests change due to external causes, and fall being something that happens to other civilizations. Both, however, include some parts of one another.
* Sexual model suggests men see rise/fall, whereas women see expansion/contraction.
* The best macrohistory or history of the future must negotiate many types of time: seasonal, rise and fall, dramatic, mythological, expansion/contraction, cosmic, linear, social-cyclical, and the timeless. The must be associated with notions of social structure, individual, and trancendental agency.
* Cyclical alone leads to fatalism. Linear alone leads to imperialism. Trancendental alone neglects economic and social development. All three are needed.
* Creativity is a key variable in understanding rise/fall as it leads to expansion, growth, wealth, power, and inner development.
* Structuring history as stages simplifys the real while providing more information than a mere summation of events. Stages also relate to mind/body, good/evil, internal/external, expansion/contraction, accumulation/distribution, absolute/relative, theory/data, etc.
* Stages can be linked by the dialectic, with each stage emerging due to contradictions in the previous stage.
* As new secieties are created, it necessitates a vanguard, which will always be a minority. These leaders can transform historical structures.
* Like futures studies, macrohistory intends to recreate history and future through a mythic distance from the present.

## Lecture

* theories of change are about patterns: incremental, evolutionary, cyclical, conflictual/dialectic, stimulus/response, etc
* agency vs structure
* when thinking about theories of change, we can also think about theories of stability
* each theory provides questions to help identify patterns that might recur, but we should note that the theories are conditioned by the environment and experience of the author
* Hines & Bishop: Teaching about the Future - ways to analyze change
  * inbound change (change we experienc) vs outbound change (change we create)
  * dimensions of change: sources/levels (from where?), time horizons (how long?), rates of change (how fast?), forms of change (what shape?)
  * different theories > different possible futures > different strategies to reach futures
  * different theories point to different sources, suggesting different places to scan for change
  * Ten general categories of change theory: progress, developmental, technology, culture, cycle, conflict, market, power, evolution, emergence
* Archetypes of Change: grow (everything climbs), collapse (everything falls), discipline (everything levels out due to careful coordination), transform (profound historical transition, whether spiritual or technological)
* Macrohistorians:
  * Ssu-Ma Ch’ien/ Si Ma Qian - Shape: cycle; Key: yin-yang - rise and fall - of virtue; Unit: moral characteristics of dynasty; Stages: sage king, progressively more inept successors, repeat
  * ibn Khaldun - Shape: cycle; Key: Asabiya - unity through collective struggle; Unit: ruling elites; Stages: decline over four generations - creativity, imitation, blind following of indolence, repeat (idealizes nomad, see settling down as failing and start of decent)
  * Smith - Shape: linear; Key: self-love and love for working together; Unit: economy; Stages: hunting/gathering, pasturage, agrarian, commerce
  * Hegel - Shape: linear; Key: states/world leaders; Unit: geist (soul of civilization) in process of perfecting itself via dialectic of thesis/antithesis/synthesis; Stages: prehistory, Oriental, Antiquity, Medieval Christianity, German Christianity
  * Comte - Shape: linear; Key: evolution of positive knowledge; Unit: episteme - system of understanding / way of knowing; Stages: theological (primitive/supernatural), metaphysical (transient/transitional - focus on abstract speculative thinking), positive (final - belief in science)
  * Marx - Shape: linear/spiral; Key: evolutionary technological / economic dialectics; Unit: labor's relation to economy; Stages: historical economic stages
  * Spencer - Shape: linear; Key: evolutionary differentiation; Unit: social structures and relations; Stages: Barbaric to militant to industrial to altruistic businessmen - driven by survival of fittest to evolve from undifferentiated, disorganized, homogenous masses, to differntiated but organized heterogeneous classes
  * Pareto - Shape: Oscillation; Key: circulation of elites, best in lower classes striving to get ahead and take control while upper classes resist and thus erode their own virtue; Unit: structure of polity; Stages: innovate/consolidate, democracy > tyranny > republic > empire > feudalism > monarchy > plutocracy
  * Spengler - Shape: life cycle; Key: maturation and decline; Unit: culture; Stages: decline from preculture through culture (nobility and priests) to late culture (capitalists class and state) ending in civilization (money in place of spirit)
  * Teilhard de Chardin - Shape: linear; Key: evolution; Unit: Universe; Stages: big bang > planetary formation > rise of life > rise of intelligence > development of spiritual conciousness > Omega (personification of universe, complete spiritualization of matter)
  * Sorokin - Shape: pendulum; Key: principle of limits; Unit: system of culture; Stages: ideational (spiritual/ascetic) > idealistic (both/harmonized) > sensate (materialistic/active) > chaos (degenerancy/decadence/dissolution)
  * Toynbee -  Shape: rise and fall; Key: challenge and response; Unit: civilizational vitality, as evidenced by the effective creativity of leading class; Stages: challenge > response > mimesis
  * Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar - Shape: cycle / spiral; Key: evolutionary vidya/avidya dialectics; Unit: varna - social cycle; Stages: laborers overcome by warriors > warriors outsmarted by intellectuals > intellectuals bought out by acquisitors/capitalists > acquisitors/capitalists overthrown by laborers
  * Eisler - Shape: multilinear + dialectical; Key: gender; Unit: structures of authority; Stages: partnership / gylany > dominator > partnership

### Review of Readings

* Polak
  * images deeply embedded in their cultural context, helps resolve uncertainty (ideally toward preferrable outcomes)
  * preferred futures collect attention, helping make them more likely to occur

* Amara - common core criteria of futures images: credibility/plausibility, reproducibility, value/impact explicitness
* Textor
  * futures research > cultural futures research > ethnographic future research
  * focused attention on histories first, to drive thoughts about transitions over time, and prime futures discussion and break away from over-focus on present
* List
  * groups of people will have perceive past/present/future differently, so there are multiples of each
  * some images are shared widely, whereas some are kept more private

### Lecture

* There are no future facts, but there are infinite images of the future (as well as previous images of the future).
* psychology of futures imaging - hopes, fears, extrapolation from the past, and imagination
* Sources of future visions
  * Culture: religions, political idealogies, artists/writers/advertisers and other artifacts
  * Society: policies that are passed, infrastructure that is built, artifacts that are created
  * Individuals: what do people do (ie volunteering), what do people think (ie surveys, ethnographic futures research, etc)
  * Forecasts: what trends have researchers extrapolated? what scenarios have futurists built?
* In looking at historical images of the future, look to what they thought would remain constant and what they think would change.
* With ads/idealogies/etc: what future is being promise? what aspirations are being tapped? how different would this future be?
* Buildings/infrastructure force some consideration of the future due to their hoped for longevity. What image are they trying to project?
* Transportation also impacts/implies the infrastructure needed to support them. ie cars vs mass transit vs zeppelin vs etc
* City planning/design also represent an image of the future in terms of what they accomodate and how, etc.
* The context of science of fiction provides an interesting image of how things might evolve. ie blade runner is very gritty/dark/pessimistic (horror/thriller), fifth element is very bright/optimistic (comedy), ghost in the shell ads-everywhere/etc
* Analyzing Images of the Future
  * Schemas: optimistic/pessimistic and deterministic/free-will quadrants

# W05: Scouting Change

## Reading: The Art of Scanning the Environment (Choo)

* Environmental scanning represents a primary mode of organizational learning about external forces, so that they can develop responses to secure or improve their position.
* Categories of research relating to information seeking:
  * Situational dimensions: the effect of preceived environmental uncertainty. If the environment is perceived to be more uncertain, more scanning will occur. Perceived uncertainty is a function of perceived complexity and dynamism.
  * Organizational strategy and scanning strategy: Overall strategy relates to sophistication, scope, and intensity of scanning.
  * Information needs, seeking and use: scanning is linked with improved organizational performance when linked with strategy.
  * Managerial traits: some evidence suggesting managers scan widely, becoming broader as you move upward in the organization.
* Modes of scanning (mix all 4 as needed)
  * undirected viewing - looking to information with no specific informational need in mind to detect change early. Many and varied sources, screening large amounts of information. Sensitizes viewer to selected areas or issues.
  * conditioned viewing - looking for particular types of information or particular topics to evaluated significance and assess impact. If impact is sufficiently significant, moves from scanning to searching.
  * informal search - actively looks to deepen knowledge and understanding of a specific issue. Relatively limited and unstructured effort to elaborate on an issue to determine if further action is required.
  * formal search - deliberate, planned effort to obtain specific information or information about a specific issue to systematically retrieve relevant information to provide a basis for decisions or a course of action.
* best practices for effective scanning
  * plan and manage scanning as a strategic activity - consider similar to R&D, long term (3-5 years to mature) effort to establish
  * implement scanning as a formal system - planned, sustained and coordinated.
  * partner with domain experts, information experts, and IT specialists in designing the scanning system - domain experts can help sort signal/noise, information specialists help add value to data and keep it accessible, and IT help move and share the information.
  * manage information as the core of the scanning function:
    * Information Needs: identify users and understand their information use
    * Information Acquisition: centrally coordinate, but distribute information gathering
    * Information Organization and Storage: centralized database/file system, organized to facilitate both searching (retrieving info) and browsing (connecting info)
    * Information Products/Dissemination: provide relevant context and other value-added services across a mix of dissemination channels and formats
    * Information Use: sensemaking, knowledge creating, and decision making
* Effective environment scanning balances control/creativity, centralization/decentralization, and focus/exploration.

## Reading: Cultural Contradictions... (Shultz)

* identifying conceptual conflict between evidence-based policy research and horizon (environmental) scanning
* scanning provides a more dynamic and faithful view of change, vs static things like briefings/white papers
* five key activities of integrated foresight:
  * trends, drivers, and emerging issues of change (weak signals) collected via scanning diverse data sources
  * change data extrapolated via statistical computation and qualitative impact assessment
  * change data, extrapolations, and impacts assembled into scenarios of possibilities
  * possibilities seen as desirable built into a preferred future, or vision
  * strategies to realize the vision devised building on positive trends and countering/ameliorating negatives
* after establishing a vision-based strategy, monitoring and updating it becomes part of the broader scanning/monitoring process
* when scanning:
  * first determine if it is objectively or only subjectly new (new to me vs new to a leading thinker)
  * determine if this is the first mention of a new change, or reinforces previous signals for the same topic
  * if it represents repitition, does it confirm or contradict?
  * try to judge how quickly the change is occurring and what the time horizon for "emergence" (public awareness/market saturation) might be
  * how credible is the source?
* many trends are established enough to already be a part of planning (ie globalization). Planning is the navigation map. Scanning is the radar that supplements the map with the current conditions on the ground.
* goal of scanning is to identify potentially significant change soon enough to monitor emergence while creating contingency plans to manage it, and with sufficient time to implement plans if needed.
* Four modes of scanning (Chun Wei Choo):
  * Touring, or undirected viewing, with no particular goal in mind across a wide variety of sources. Sensitizes to potentially significant change.
  * Tracking, or conditioned viewing, focuses on change items with potential impact to an organization or goal. Reviews pre-selected sources of relevance to the topic of interest.
  * Satisficing, or informal search, digs more deeply into a single issue or event, to determine quickly and efficiently if action is needed (which could include more formal research).
  * Retrieving, or formal search, in-depth research on a specific issue or event. Articulated methodology and exhaustive search for sources.
* Given the breadth needed on the touring end and the depth needed on the retrieving end, this is best performed by an integrated network of people.
* Choosing Touring/Horizon-Scanning Sources:
  * in science/technology, look for sources the communities use themselves to announce news
  * in social/cultural, look for ideas among artists and youth
* Validating Scanning Sources:
  * High citation numbers, media distribution, "buzz"
  * Market niche of material (look to mission statements and/or self descriptions)
  * Distribution: how widely distributed/used is it?
  * Media: print journal, newsletter, tabloid, etc
* Organizing Scanning Data:
  * STEEP: social, technological, economic, environmental, political
  * PESTLE: political, economic, social, techonological, legal, environmental
  * PESTLEC: political, economic, social, techonological, legal, environmental, culture
  * create, relate, consume, connect, define
  * broad categories can also be subdivided
  * folksonomies (if available)
* Validating Scanning Data:
  * Confirmation, or accruing multiple citations
  * Convergence, or emerging scientific consensus
  * Parallax, or acquiring "depth of field" by collecting views from multiple cultural viewpoints (both organizational and ethnic/cultural)

## Reading: Reframing environmental scanning: an integral approach (Voros)

* A broadened scanning framework, which may also provide understanding of how human minds filter their perceptions of the world.
* Cross-level analysis examines the world in terms of both the perceptual filters of the viewer and the aspect of the world being viewed.
* Based upon Four-Quadrant Integral model of Ken Wilber and Spiral Dynamics model of Don Beck and Chris Cowan.
* Four Quadrants based around Interior/Exterior, Individual/Collective:
  * UL, upper-left, intentional, subjective, "I", individual subjective awareness (hope, joy, dreams, cognitive capacities, intentions)
  * UR, upper-right, behavioural, objective, "it", objectively measurable aspects or behaviors of individuals
  * LL, lower-left, cultural, inter-subjective, "we", exchange of beliefs and experiences with others
  * LR, lower-right, social, inter-objective, "its", external interactions, most STEEP analysis is here
* Multiple levels radiating out from the center as: matter, body, mind, soul, spirit. Things progress to go up through them.
* Spiral Dynamics is a system for understanding how people think about things (ie the process), not simply the things they think about (ie the content).
  * Spiral Dynamics also sometimes described as "describing the containers that shape world views, not the contents that fill them"
  * Models evolution of human cognitive capacity as double-helix, one side is "life conditions" external to the individual and the other side are the cognitive capacities of the brain/mind system. Across the spiral, life conditions are matched with adequate coping mechanisms.
  * Describes an emergent system. Pairings are color coded (rather than ranked), with later ones tending toward more expansive, whereas earlier ones are needed to reach the later ones.
  * Spiral Dynamics structures:
    * Beige - archaic-instinctual - Survival Sense - 'do what you must do just to stay alive'
    * Purple - magical-animistic - Kin Spirits - 'keep the spirits happy and the tribe's nest warm and safe'
    * Red - impulsive-egotistical - Power Gods - 'be what you are and do what you want, regardless'
    * Blue - mythic-purposeful - Truth Force - 'life has meaning, direction and purpose with predetermined outcomes'
    * Orange - rationalist-achievist - Strive Drive - 'act in your own self-interest by playing the game to win'
    * Green - pluralistic-communitarian - Human Bond - 'seek peace within the inner self and explore, with others, the caring dimensions of community
    * Yellow - systemic-integrative - Flex Flow - 'live fully and responsibily as what you are, and learn to "become"'
    * Turquoise - globalist-holistic - Whole View - 'experience the wholeness of existence through body, mind and spirit'
  * Each system has an Entering phase, a Nodal (peak) phase, and an exiting phase. Entering is written in all-caps and exiting is written with a slash between the old and new states.
  * 'People are not the Spiral, the Spiral is in people.' - we are at different levels/systems for different parts of our life
  * Spiral Dynamics and world views
    * Blue - fundamentalism
    * Orange - formal operational thinking in a rational world view.
    * Green - pluralistic relativism
    * Yellow - systemic
    * Turquoise - holistic
* Cross-level analysis - focus on (epistemological) level from which scanning is done and the (ontological) level toward which it is being directed.
* Suggests that we should tune our message and delivery to the receiver, so that it will be more likely to be heard and understood.
* Cross-level analysis can be used to understand the strengths/weaknesses of scanners in order to better balance the network.
