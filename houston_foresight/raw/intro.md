# W1: Introductions and Overview

* Foundations:
  * Macro historians: Hegel, Marx, Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin
  * Utopianists, philosophers, sociologists: More, Condorcet, Saint-Simon, Comte
* charting sweeping change through social systems
* we are not able to collect future facts, but we can collect future images
* we think about the future with the same brain parts that we use to think about the fast
* pasts, presents, futures; hopes, fears, extrapolation, imagination
* Early post WW2 Futurists
  * European - focus on rebuilding; philosophical and visionary approach; via images, visioning, planning, and la prospective
  * USA - focus on resource allocation and production; quantitative, technical, and method based approach; via system modelling, delphi, and scenarios
  * Socialist Economies - focus on central economy planning; econometric forecasting approach; via quantitative, trend extrapolation, and goal-based forecasting
  * Developing world - focus on nation building; visioning, econometrics, and post modernism approaches; via planning ,trend extrapolation, and critical analysis
* two conflicting images of the future emerged
  * technical optimists; such as Herman Kahn and The Year 2000, 1967
  * environmental doomsayers and neo-Malthusians: The Club of Rome's Limits to Growth systems model, Dennis and Donella Meadows, 1972.
* followed later by: spiritual tranformation, high technology transformation/transhumanism, collapse (political, economic, environmental)
* emerging futures research tools (futures specific, complementing research methods derived from other disciplines)
  * emerging issues analysis: Coates
  * Delphi surveys: Helmer and Gordon
  * Futures Wheels: Glenn
  * Scenarios: Kahn (later Royal Dutch Shell scenarios, de Geus and others)
  * Systems dynamics modeling: Forrester, Meadows & Meadows and others
  * Futures workshops: Jungk
  * CLA and integral futures: Inayatullah, Slaughter, Voros
  * Experiential and design futures: Dunagan, Candy, Kornet, Zaidi, Bisht
* futures disturb the present, as assumptions that the world in 10 years will be like it was 10 years ago.
* alternative possible futures
  * reality is non-linear, creating a chaotic and unpredictable system
  * possible futures emerge from the turbulent interplay of emerging change with our complex, evolving selves and societies
* alternative possible futures - there are many possibilities, some are more probable than others, we can track probabilities by monitoring trends, some possibilities are more preferable
* 5 thinking modes: creative, logical, systemic, critical, intuitive-empathetic
* 5 foresight activities: identify and monitor change, map and critique impacts, imagine alternative outcomes, envision preferred futures, organize and act to create change
