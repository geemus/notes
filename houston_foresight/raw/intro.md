# W1: Introductions and Overview

## Reading: The Futures Field: Functions, Forms, and Critical Issues (Amara)
## Reading: A Way through the Maze: what futurists do and how they do it (Garrett)
## Reading: What corporations do with foresight (Hammoud & Nash)

* Foundations:
  * Macro historians: Hegel, Marx, Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin
  * Utopianists, philosophers, sociologists: More, Condorcet, Saint-Simon, Comte
* charting sweeping change through social systems
* we are not able to collect future facts, but we can collect future images
* we think about the future with the same brain parts that we use to think about the fast
* pasts, presents, futures; hopes, fears, extrapolation, imagination
* Early post WW2 Futurists
  * European - focus on rebuilding; philosophical and visionary approach; via images, visioning, planning, and la prospective
  * USA - focus on resource allocation and production; quantitative, technical, and method based approach; via system modelling, delphi, and scenarios
  * Socialist Economies - focus on central economy planning; econometric forecasting approach; via quantitative, trend extrapolation, and goal-based forecasting
  * Developing world - focus on nation building; visioning, econometrics, and post modernism approaches; via planning ,trend extrapolation, and critical analysis
* two conflicting images of the future emerged
  * technical optimists; such as Herman Kahn and The Year 2000, 1967
  * environmental doomsayers and neo-Malthusians: The Club of Rome's Limits to Growth systems model, Dennis and Donella Meadows, 1972.
* followed later by: spiritual tranformation, high technology transformation/transhumanism, collapse (political, economic, environmental)
* emerging futures research tools (futures specific, complementing research methods derived from other disciplines)
  * emerging issues analysis: Coates
  * Delphi surveys: Helmer and Gordon
  * Futures Wheels: Glenn
  * Scenarios: Kahn (later Royal Dutch Shell scenarios, de Geus and others)
  * Systems dynamics modeling: Forrester, Meadows & Meadows and others
  * Futures workshops: Jungk
  * CLA and integral futures: Inayatullah, Slaughter, Voros
  * Experiential and design futures: Dunagan, Candy, Kornet, Zaidi, Bisht
* futures disturb the present, as assumptions that the world in 10 years will be like it was 10 years ago.
* alternative possible futures
  * reality is non-linear, creating a chaotic and unpredictable system
  * possible futures emerge from the turbulent interplay of emerging change with our complex, evolving selves and societies
* alternative possible futures - there are many possibilities, some are more probable than others, we can track probabilities by monitoring trends, some possibilities are more preferable
* 5 thinking modes: creative, logical, systemic, critical, intuitive-empathetic
* 5 foresight activities: identify and monitor change, map and critique impacts, imagine alternative outcomes, envision preferred futures, organize and act to create change

# W2: History of Futures Studies and Foresight

## Reading: History of Futures (Schultz)

* Five waves of futures work
  * Oral Tradition: shamans and mystics embedded in deep myths.
  * Early Written Age: early macrohistorians, looking for patterns in the past and cycles of repitition.  * Extraction and Enlightenment: progress through science, technology, and rationalism. Foten leading to tension between images of techonology and environment.  * Systems and Cybernetics: growing hand-in-hand with systems thinking as a sister science in response to the Great Depression and support of the Second World War.
  * Complexity and Emergence: shifting toward deeper understanding of hidden social and cultural determinents of our futures.

## Reading: Future Studies: A New Field of Inquiry (Bell)

* Much work came out of response/recovery from WW2.
  * Some focusing around nation formation and nation building.
  * Some focusing around military planning and scenarios (wrt cold war).
* Lots of work tied up with government, defense, etc that were classified or otherwise not publicly accessible.
* Much of this came to a head amidst protests/etc of Vietnam war and cival rights.
* Commission of the Year 2000 came together, starting in 1965, to try and formalize futures and bring them to civilian interests.
* Limits to Growth (1972) and the Club of Rome, predicted an end to population and industrial growth in the next century. It outlined a number of possibilities, though continued unrestricted growth was not among them. The rest depended on the choices we would make.
* H.D. Lasswell and Policy Sciences, beginning in 1930s. Warned of society in which specialists on violence would become the most powerful group.
  * Outlined five specific tasks for study of the future: clarification of goals and values, description of trends, explanation of conditions, projection of possible and probable futures under current policies, and invention/evaluation/selection of policy alternatives to achieve preferred goals.
  * Established policy sciences as identifiable, respectable, even desirable professional activity
  * Future studies aims to view future as an open horizon to creatively explore, whereas policy studies tend to try and "de-futurize" the future to increase security.
* Evaluation Research - originally evaluate goverment programs to see if they achieved their goals, and who/what was responsible for success/failure. Now includes prospective as well as retrospective aspects.

## Reading: Reconceptualizing Futures (Masini)

* How can we move from abstractly looking into the future to actually building the future?
* As we navigate toward desirable futures, we must ask on what basis we decide what is desirable.
* Three levels of looking at the future, representing three different philosophical approaches:
  * "something is changing" - "prognosis" Look at data of the past and present to point the way toward what is possible and identify what is probable. Relies on extrapolating from social, economic and other indicators. Relates to philosphy of John Locke.
  * "something MUST be changed" - "visions" Aspire to transform the present by a vision of the future. Instead of probables, this approach focuses on desirables. Relates to philosophy of Leibnitz.
  * "something CAN be changed" - "projects" Combines knowledge of possibles/probables and a vision of desirables. This acknowledges the interest of the observer. Possibly relating to non-Western philosophies.
* "visions" approach often relies on existing visions of writers, poets, political scientists, philosophers, policy-makers, etc. Perhaps instead it sholud develop it's own visions.
* The best listeners/capturers ar those somehow outside the logic of the specific system, as those inside it often have socialital charatacter become an assumed identity.
* Those who build visions identify that which is different that the present, but that is not pure utopia (since these do not occur historically).
* Visions built not only with rational capabilities, but also intuitive, imaginitive capacities.
* Any future one envisions will reflect social character and individual temperament, so it is important to include this openly and understandably. Furthermore, projects/visions should be made and shared by many diverse individuals to paint a more complete picture.
* Future projects are political and ethical positions that lead to action.
* Futurists must learn and help others to learn in future terms. This learning should be based on:
  * Awareness of the Interrelation Between Psychological and Social Character
  * Respect for One's Own Culture and at the Same Time Awareness of Other Cultures
  * Learning Should Be Geared to Identity
  * Learning Must Be Geared to the Ultimate Question of Existence (meaning of life). Not to answer these questions but to perceive the range of answers.

## Reading: Corporate Futures (Rohrbeck et al)

* Foresight is built on the assumptions that:
  * multiple futures are possible (due to uncertainty and unpredictability)
  * change (drivers) can be identified and studied
  * the future can be influenced
* Corporate Foresight is identifying, observing and interpreting factors that induce change, determining possible organization-specific implications, and triggering appropriate organizational responses. Corporate foresight involves relevant stakeholders and creates value through providing access to critical resources ahead of competition, preparing the organization for change, and permitting the organization to steer proactively toward a desired future.
* Historical Context:
  * 1950s - foresight work engaging experts vs prospective work which applies collaboratively directly with decision makers
  * 1960s and 1970s - scenarios provide systematic approaches to identifying key change drivers
  * 1980s and 1990s - professionalization with methods such as technology roadmapping and continuous environmental scanning.
  * 2000s+ - organizational integration of routines facilitating futures insights, though many firms struggle to translate this into action. Dilemma of needing large variety of data to be interpretted and a lack of time and attention span from leadership to engage.
* Decision-Making Routine vs Integrated Organizational Practice
* Current Studies: Organizing, Cognition, Network Organizations, Value Assessment
* Future Studies:
  * Managerial cognition - emphasizing the role of individual and group cognition in shaping perception and influencing decision-making.
  * Forward-looking search - emphasizes that individuals are bounded-rational, and therefore firm decision maknig cannot be conceptualized as purely rational or analytic reasoning.
  * Prospective sensemaking considers organizing as a process in which individuals build on past experiences, retrospectively and collectively reflect on these episodes, and through sustained interaction build converging cause maps that permit them to converge behind common objectives and lines of action.

## Reading: Historical Review of the Development of Future-Oriented Technology Assessment (Johnston)

* Forecasting and Foresight
  * relate to a transition to new approaches of social change based on deliberate intervention toward specified ends
  * initial focus around public policy, but quickly spreading to business generally large captila intensive ones with longer planning horizons.
  * gradual shift away from methodology-driven studies toward a variety of tools, each suitable for different purposes and with different strengths and limitations.
  * critical technologies forecasting centered on an assumption that certain identifiable technologies were key to future economic performance.
* Technology Assessment
  * seeks to asses potential and implications of emerging and future technologies

## Lecture
* much divination, as well as foresight, focus on identifying patterns of change * general systems theory - a system is a complex of interacting elements that are open to, and interact with their environments
* system dynamics - attempts to understand nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, and time delays (Limits to Growth Model)
* chaos theory - some systems have instability and nonlinear change processes
* complexity theory - describes self-organization, and adaptation and innovation to cause undpredictable change.
