# W01: Introductions and Overview

## Reading: The Futures Field: Functions, Forms, and Critical Issues (Amara)

* Five basic functions: goals formulation, methods development, applications, coupling, and implementation.
* Institutional forms: image generators, research organizations, corporate planning groups, and citizen groups.
* Futures field: Any systematic attempt to improve our understanding of the future consequences of present developments and choices.
  * Broken into three categories: exploration of possible futures (art of futurism), exploration of probable futures (science of futurism), and exploration of preferable futures (politics and psychology of futurism).
* General Features of the present Futures Field:
  * Visionary: integrative and strategic, generally more than 5 years, and often 20 or more years into the future
  * Analytical: multidisciplinary and methodological with emphasis on explictness in forecasting, modelling, scenario building, and related activities
  * Participatory: problem and implementation-oriented with particular attention to social and political dimensions
* Functions or Roles:
  * Goal formulation: issue or problem definition; future-image creation or alternative futures generation. Ties to visionary, least explicit, most intuitive, and most personal.
  * Methods development: includes developing body of explicit, organized knowledg about event and trend forecasting, process modelling, and data integration. Together with applications, stems from analytical or research components.
  * Applications: provide inputs to planning and decision-making by expanding range of useful alternatives, evaluating consequences, and structuring intervention. May or may not involve formal methodologies.
  * Coupling: socio-psychological and organizational aspects of information transfer to influence individual perceptions, behavior, and attitudes. Taken together with implementation, coupling is at the participatory roots of the Futures Field.
  * Implementation: interventions and actions actually token to realize objectives of a plan, and the informative feedback that may lead to changes in plans.
* Major groups/institutions (~150 total):
  * Goal setters or "image generators" (50-60) - highly imaginative image-oriented thinking.
  * Research organizations (25-30) - focus on applications-oriented activities and often methodology.
  * Corporate or government plannig groups (50) - focus on coupling activities, usually not directly involved in research.
  * Citizen groups (10-25) - interested public, often not directly affiliated with futures field.
* Circuit of the links among functions:
  * Goals-Methods: Weak connectivity. Unlikely that goals will influence methods, but methods could potentially influence goals. No existing forms focus on this link.
  * Methods-Applications: Best connected link, representing analytical and research arms.
  * Applications-Coupling: Poor connectivity. This absence of effective mechanism for coupling research to end users is a critical institutional problem for the futures field. No known related institutions exist.
  * Coupling-Implementation: Week to non-existent link. Citizen groups have raised awareness (coupling), but struggled with implementation. Emerging institutional forms may help bridge the gap.
  * Implementation-Goals: largely undefined and uncharted. Visionary goals and implementation seem at odds with one another. Unclear how to bridge this gap.
* Researchable Issues
  * Institutional Effectiveness - could use clearer measures of how effective output is and what biases may have gone into it.
  * Integration of Approaches - could use a unified theory of how things fit together.
  * Understanding social change - need to better understand and be able to describe at the societal level.
  * Research to users - need to characterize and understand micro (individual level) process of change and how to foster/realize change.
* Likely marks made by Futures Field:
  * deeper understanding of social change processes at macro and micro levels
  * more effective qualitative (judgmental) and quantitative (analytical) components in planning
  * more balance multidisciplinary planning with social sciences partnerning with physical and analytical sciences

## Reading: What corporations do with foresight (Hammoud & Nash)

* Foundations:
  * Macro historians: Hegel, Marx, Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin
  * Utopianists, philosophers, sociologists: More, Condorcet, Saint-Simon, Comte
* charting sweeping change through social systems
* we are not able to collect future facts, but we can collect future images
* we think about the future with the same brain parts that we use to think about the fast
* pasts, presents, futures; hopes, fears, extrapolation, imagination
* Early post WW2 Futurists
  * European - focus on rebuilding; philosophical and visionary approach; via images, visioning, planning, and la prospective
  * USA - focus on resource allocation and production; quantitative, technical, and method based approach; via system modelling, delphi, and scenarios
  * Socialist Economies - focus on central economy planning; econometric forecasting approach; via quantitative, trend extrapolation, and goal-based forecasting
  * Developing world - focus on nation building; visioning, econometrics, and post modernism approaches; via planning ,trend extrapolation, and critical analysis
* two conflicting images of the future emerged
  * technical optimists; such as Herman Kahn and The Year 2000, 1967
  * environmental doomsayers and neo-Malthusians: The Club of Rome's Limits to Growth systems model, Dennis and Donella Meadows, 1972.

* alternative possible futures
  * reality is non-linear, creating a chaotic and unpredictable system
  * possible futures emerge from the turbulent interplay of emerging change with our complex, evolving selves and societies
* alternative possible futures - there are many possibilities, some are more probable than others, we can track probabilities by monitoring trends, some possibilities are more preferable
* 5 thinking modes: creative, logical, systemic, critical, intuitive-empathetic
* 5 foresight activities: identify and monitor change, map and critique impacts, imagine alternative outcomes, envision preferred futures, organize and act to create change

# W02: History of Futures Studies and Foresight

## Reading: History of Futures (Schultz)

* Five waves of futures work
  * Oral Tradition: shamans and mystics embedded in deep myths.
  * Early Written Age: early macrohistorians, looking for patterns in the past and cycles of repitition.  * Extraction and Enlightenment: progress through science, technology, and rationalism. Foten leading to tension between images of techonology and environment.  * Systems and Cybernetics: growing hand-in-hand with systems thinking as a sister science in response to the Great Depression and support of the Second World War.
  * Complexity and Emergence: shifting toward deeper understanding of hidden social and cultural determinents of our futures.

## Reading: Future Studies: A New Field of Inquiry (Bell)

* Much work came out of response/recovery from WW2.
  * Some focusing around nation formation and nation building.
  * Some focusing around military planning and scenarios (wrt cold war).
* Lots of work tied up with government, defense, etc that were classified or otherwise not publicly accessible.
* Much of this came to a head amidst protests/etc of Vietnam war and cival rights.
* Commission of the Year 2000 came together, starting in 1965, to try and formalize futures and bring them to civilian interests.
* Limits to Growth (1972) and the Club of Rome, predicted an end to population and industrial growth in the next century. It outlined a number of possibilities, though continued unrestricted growth was not among them. The rest depended on the choices we would make.
* H.D. Lasswell and Policy Sciences, beginning in 1930s. Warned of society in which specialists on violence would become the most powerful group.
  * Outlined five specific tasks for study of the future: clarification of goals and values, description of trends, explanation of conditions, projection of possible and probable futures under current policies, and invention/evaluation/selection of policy alternatives to achieve preferred goals.
  * Established policy sciences as identifiable, respectable, even desirable professional activity
  * Future studies aims to view future as an open horizon to creatively explore, whereas policy studies tend to try and "de-futurize" the future to increase security.
* Evaluation Research - originally evaluate goverment programs to see if they achieved their goals, and who/what was responsible for success/failure. Now includes prospective as well as retrospective aspects.

## Reading: Reconceptualizing Futures (Masini)

* How can we move from abstractly looking into the future to actually building the future?
* As we navigate toward desirable futures, we must ask on what basis we decide what is desirable.
* Three levels of looking at the future, representing three different philosophical approaches:
  * "something is changing" - "prognosis" Look at data of the past and present to point the way toward what is possible and identify what is probable. Relies on extrapolating from social, economic and other indicators. Relates to philosphy of John Locke.
  * "something MUST be changed" - "visions" Aspire to transform the present by a vision of the future. Instead of probables, this approach focuses on desirables. Relates to philosophy of Leibnitz.
  * "something CAN be changed" - "projects" Combines knowledge of possibles/probables and a vision of desirables. This acknowledges the interest of the observer. Possibly relating to non-Western philosophies.
* "visions" approach often relies on existing visions of writers, poets, political scientists, philosophers, policy-makers, etc. Perhaps instead it sholud develop it's own visions.
* The best listeners/capturers ar those somehow outside the logic of the specific system, as those inside it often have socialital charatacter become an assumed identity.
* Those who build visions identify that which is different that the present, but that is not pure utopia (since these do not occur historically).
* Visions built not only with rational capabilities, but also intuitive, imaginitive capacities.
* Any future one envisions will reflect social character and individual temperament, so it is important to include this openly and understandably. Furthermore, projects/visions should be made and shared by many diverse individuals to paint a more complete picture.
* Future projects are political and ethical positions that lead to action.
* Futurists must learn and help others to learn in future terms. This learning should be based on:
  * Awareness of the Interrelation Between Psychological and Social Character
  * Respect for One's Own Culture and at the Same Time Awareness of Other Cultures
  * Learning Should Be Geared to Identity
  * Learning Must Be Geared to the Ultimate Question of Existence (meaning of life). Not to answer these questions but to perceive the range of answers.

## Reading: Corporate Futures (Rohrbeck et al)

* Foresight is built on the assumptions that:
  * multiple futures are possible (due to uncertainty and unpredictability)
  * change (drivers) can be identified and studied
  * the future can be influenced
* Corporate Foresight is identifying, observing and interpreting factors that induce change, determining possible organization-specific implications, and triggering appropriate organizational responses. Corporate foresight involves relevant stakeholders and creates value through providing access to critical resources ahead of competition, preparing the organization for change, and permitting the organization to steer proactively toward a desired future.
* Historical Context:
  * 1950s - foresight work engaging experts vs prospective work which applies collaboratively directly with decision makers
  * 1960s and 1970s - scenarios provide systematic approaches to identifying key change drivers
  * 1980s and 1990s - professionalization with methods such as technology roadmapping and continuous environmental scanning.
  * 2000s+ - organizational integration of routines facilitating futures insights, though many firms struggle to translate this into action. Dilemma of needing large variety of data to be interpretted and a lack of time and attention span from leadership to engage.
* Decision-Making Routine vs Integrated Organizational Practice
* Current Studies: Organizing, Cognition, Network Organizations, Value Assessment
* Future Studies:
  * Managerial cognition - emphasizing the role of individual and group cognition in shaping perception and influencing decision-making.
  * Forward-looking search - emphasizes that individuals are bounded-rational, and therefore firm decision maknig cannot be conceptualized as purely rational or analytic reasoning.
  * Prospective sensemaking considers organizing as a process in which individuals build on past experiences, retrospectively and collectively reflect on these episodes, and through sustained interaction build converging cause maps that permit them to converge behind common objectives and lines of action.

## Reading: Historical Review of the Development of Future-Oriented Technology Assessment (Johnston)

* Forecasting and Foresight
  * relate to a transition to new approaches of social change based on deliberate intervention toward specified ends
  * initial focus around public policy, but quickly spreading to business generally large captila intensive ones with longer planning horizons.
  * gradual shift away from methodology-driven studies toward a variety of tools, each suitable for different purposes and with different strengths and limitations.
  * critical technologies forecasting centered on an assumption that certain identifiable technologies were key to future economic performance.
* Technology Assessment
  * seeks to asses potential and implications of emerging and future technologies

## Lecture

* much divination, as well as foresight, focus on identifying patterns of change * general systems theory - a system is a complex of interacting elements that are open to, and interact with their environments
* system dynamics - attempts to understand nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, and time delays (Limits to Growth Model)
* chaos theory - some systems have instability and nonlinear change processes
* complexity theory - describes self-organization, and adaptation and innovation to cause undpredictable change.

# W03: Theories of Change

## Reading: Macrohistory and Futures Studies (Inayatullah)

* Macrohistory is the study of the histories of social systems in search of patterns or even laws of social change.
* Looking at causes and mechanisms of historical change, what changes and what remains stable, analyzing units of history, and presenting stages of history all provide structure for forecasting and insight into the future.
* Tension in this view between structure/structuralism and agency/individualism/liberalism.
* Ideally a theory includes linear, cyclical and tracendenal dimensions and has agency, structure, and superagency (trancendental) causes of movement.
* As we consider individual's ability to influence, we must acknowledge this happens within a set of conditions that bias influence their ability to choose. Macrohistorians see these biases themselves as existing within structures and forming patterns.
* Cyclical theorists suggest limits which result in rise and fall. Linear suggests change due to external causes, and fall being something that happens to other civilizations. Both, however, include some parts of one another.
* Sexual model suggests men see rise/fall, whereas women see expansion/contraction.
* The best macrohistory or history of the future must negotiate many types of time: seasonal, rise and fall, dramatic, mythological, expansion/contraction, cosmic, linear, social-cyclical, and the timeless. The must be associated with notions of social structure, individual, and trancendental agency.
* Cyclical alone leads to fatalism. Linear alone leads to imperialism. Trancendental alone neglects economic and social development. All three are needed.
* Creativity is a key variable in understanding rise/fall as it leads to expansion, growth, wealth, power, and inner development.
* Structuring history as stages simplifys the real while providing more information than a mere summation of events. Stages also relate to mind/body, good/evil, internal/external, expansion/contraction, accumulation/distribution, absolute/relative, theory/data, etc.
* Stages can be linked by the dialectic, with each stage emerging due to contradictions in the previous stage.
* As new secieties are created, it necessitates a vanguard, which will always be a minority. These leaders can transform historical structures.
* Like futures studies, macrohistory intends to recreate history and future through a mythic distance from the present.

## Lecture

* theories of change are about patterns: incremental, evolutionary, cyclical, conflictual/dialectic, stimulus/response, etc
* agency vs structure
* when thinking about theories of change, we can also think about theories of stability
* each theory provides questions to help identify patterns that might recur, but we should note that the theories are conditioned by the environment and experience of the author
* Hines & Bishop: Teaching about the Future - ways to analyze change
  * inbound change (change we experienc) vs outbound change (change we create)
  * dimensions of change: sources/levels (from where?), time horizons (how long?), rates of change (how fast?), forms of change (what shape?)
  * different theories > different possible futures > different strategies to reach futures
  * different theories point to different sources, suggesting different places to scan for change
  * Ten general categories of change theory: progress, developmental, technology, culture, cycle, conflict, market, power, evolution, emergence
* Archetypes of Change: grow (everything climbs), collapse (everything falls), discipline (everything levels out due to careful coordination), transform (profound historical transition, whether spiritual or technological)
* Macrohistorians:
  * Ssu-Ma Ch’ien/ Si Ma Qian - Shape: cycle; Key: yin-yang - rise and fall - of virtue; Unit: moral characteristics of dynasty; Stages: sage king, progressively more inept successors, repeat
  * ibn Khaldun - Shape: cycle; Key: Asabiya - unity through collective struggle; Unit: ruling elites; Stages: decline over four generations - creativity, imitation, blind following of indolence, repeat (idealizes nomad, see settling down as failing and start of decent)

  * Comte - Shape: linear; Key: evolution of positive knowledge; Unit: episteme - system of understanding / way of knowing; Stages: theological (primitive/supernatural), metaphysical (transient/transitional - focus on abstract speculative thinking), positive (final - belief in science)
  * Marx - Shape: linear/spiral; Key: evolutionary technological / economic dialectics; Unit: labor's relation to economy; Stages: historical economic stages
  * Spencer - Shape: linear; Key: evolutionary differentiation; Unit: social structures and relations; Stages: Barbaric to militant to industrial to altruistic businessmen - driven by survival of fittest to evolve from undifferentiated, disorganized, homogenous masses, to differntiated but organized heterogeneous classes
  * Pareto - Shape: Oscillation; Key: circulation of elites, best in lower classes striving to get ahead and take control while upper classes resist and thus erode their own virtue; Unit: structure of polity; Stages: innovate/consolidate, democracy > tyranny > republic > empire > feudalism > monarchy > plutocracy
  * Spengler - Shape: life cycle; Key: maturation and decline; Unit: culture; Stages: decline from preculture through culture (nobility and priests) to late culture (capitalists class and state) ending in civilization (money in place of spirit)
  * Teilhard de Chardin - Shape: linear; Key: evolution; Unit: Universe; Stages: big bang > planetary formation > rise of life > rise of intelligence > development of spiritual conciousness > Omega (personification of universe, complete spiritualization of matter)
  * Sorokin - Shape: pendulum; Key: principle of limits; Unit: system of culture; Stages: ideational (spiritual/ascetic) > idealistic (both/harmonized) > sensate (materialistic/active) > chaos (degenerancy/decadence/dissolution)
  * Toynbee -  Shape: rise and fall; Key: challenge and response; Unit: civilizational vitality, as evidenced by the effective creativity of leading class; Stages: challenge > response > mimesis
  * Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar - Shape: cycle / spiral; Key: evolutionary vidya/avidya dialectics; Unit: varna - social cycle; Stages: laborers overcome by warriors > warriors outsmarted by intellectuals > intellectuals bought out by acquisitors/capitalists > acquisitors/capitalists overthrown by laborers
  * Eisler - Shape: multilinear + dialectical; Key: gender; Unit: structures of authority; Stages: partnership / gylany > dominator > partnership

  * disruptive innovations (Clayton Christensen)
  * media and the transfer of information and meaning (Marshall McLuhan)
  * generational change aka age-cohort analysis (Strauss and Howe)
* Micro-Level Theories - change at the level of the individual; interior change.

# W04: Images of the Future(s)

## Reading: The Image of the Future, introduction (Polak)

* Highlights from Lecture:
  * images deeply embedded in their cultural context, helps resolve uncertainty (ideally toward preferrable outcomes)
  * preferred futures collect attention, helping make them more likely to occur
  * can delineate images as quadrants of optimistic/pessimistic and deterministic/free-will
* Aspects of Images of the Future
  * Origin and Formation - Always aristocratic, ie from the creative minority. Requires awareness of the future in order to consider alternatives, and ethics to determine preference.
  * Propogation and Driving Force - tends to relate to idealism (rather than materialism)
  * Image-Effect - relationship between projected future and actual future as it passes.
  * Self-Elimination - takes place through succession of images and the dialectic changes they provoke.
  * Periodic Self-Correction and Adaptation to Time Change - conversely, sometimes the dialectic results in renewal and change.
  * Loss of Capacity for Self-Correction - recent apparent loss of projections of futures and focus on the present.
* essense: what must be (deterministic) - vs - influence: what might be (free-will)
  * essense-optimism/influence-pessism - man has little positive role, and is tool of higher power.
  * essense-pessimism/influence-pessism - chaos reigns, man can only resign to inevitable
  * influence-optimism - two types:
    * man's role is indirect, accent on supernatural power and man's reconciliation.
    * man's role is direct, accent on natural events and human effort.
  * influence-optimism sets the mandate to work against the mandate to pray.
* rise and fall of images of the future precedes or accompanies the rise and fall of cultures
* images live or die based on their ability to respond to change and maintain or adapt to remain as a comprehensive and inspiring vision of the future
* Polak argues that bold visionary thinking and imaginative projection are prerequisites for effective but gradual social change.

## Reading: Views on Methodology (Amara)

* Highlights from Lecture - common core criteria of futures images: credibility/plausibility, reproducibility, value/impact explicitness

## Reading: Ethnographic Futures Research (Textor)

* Highlights from Lecture:
  * futures research > cultural futures research > ethnographic future research
  * focused attention on histories first, to drive thoughts about transitions over time, and prime futures discussion and break away from over-focus on present

## Reading: Pasts Presents Futures (List)

* Highlights from Lecture:
  * groups of people will have perceive past/present/future differently, so there are multiples of each
  * some images are shared widely, whereas some are kept more private

## Lecture

* There are no future facts, but there are infinite images of the future (as well as previous images of the future).
* psychology of futures imaging - hopes, fears, extrapolation from the past, and imagination
* Sources of future visions
  * Culture: religions, political idealogies, artists/writers/advertisers and other artifacts
  * Society: policies that are passed, infrastructure that is built, artifacts that are created
  * Individuals: what do people do (ie volunteering), what do people think (ie surveys, ethnographic futures research, etc)
  * Forecasts: what trends have researchers extrapolated? what scenarios have futurists built?
* In looking at historical images of the future, look to what they thought would remain constant and what they think would change.
* With ads/idealogies/etc: what future is being promise? what aspirations are being tapped? how different would this future be?
* Buildings/infrastructure force some consideration of the future due to their hoped for longevity. What image are they trying to project?
* Transportation also impacts/implies the infrastructure needed to support them. ie cars vs mass transit vs zeppelin vs etc
* City planning/design also represent an image of the future in terms of what they accomodate and how, etc.
* The context of science of fiction provides an interesting image of how things might evolve. ie blade runner is very gritty/dark/pessimistic (horror/thriller), fifth element is very bright/optimistic (comedy), ghost in the shell ads-everywhere/etc
* Analyzing Images of the Future
  * Schemas: optimistic/pessimistic and deterministic/free-will quadrants
  * Kinds: possible, probable, plausible/credible, preferable
  * Archetypes:
    * business as usual: continued growth (nightmare: economic collapse)
    * environment sustainability (nightmare: ecological collapse)
    * idealogical exclusionism (nightmare: anarchy, collapse of rule of law)
    * high tech transformation (nightmare: infrastructure/system collapse)
    * spiritual transcendence (nightmare: anomic collapse)
* Key Ideas:
  * Images drive behavior at all levels
  * Optimism and efficacy are critical for success
  * Images of futures are embedded everywhere
  * Common futures - archetypes - exist
  * Futures have multiple distinguishing dimensions
* Image Rating Frameworks
  * IFTF Meta-analytics spider chart: Logic, Complex/Nuanced, Evocative, Provocative, Stimulating
  * Verge spider chart - degrees of change: Define, Related, Connect, Create, Consume, Destroy
  * STEEP spider chart - degrees of change: Society, Technology, Economy, Environment, Politics

# W05: Scouting Change

## Reading: The Art of Scanning the Environment (Choo)

* Focus Question from Schultz: considering Choo's four modes of scanning, how would you apply the different modes to different foresight topics or projects?
* Environmental scanning represents a primary mode of organizational learning about external forces, so that they can develop responses to secure or improve their position.
* Categories of research relating to information seeking:
  * Situational dimensions: the effect of preceived environmental uncertainty. If the environment is perceived to be more uncertain, more scanning will occur. Perceived uncertainty is a function of perceived complexity and dynamism.
  * Organizational strategy and scanning strategy: Overall strategy relates to sophistication, scope, and intensity of scanning.
  * Information needs, seeking and use: scanning is linked with improved organizational performance when linked with strategy.
  * Managerial traits: some evidence suggesting managers scan widely, becoming broader as you move upward in the organization.
* Modes of scanning (mix all 4 as needed)
  * undirected viewing - looking to information with no specific informational need in mind to detect change early. Many and varied sources, screening large amounts of information. Sensitizes viewer to selected areas or issues.
  * conditioned viewing - looking for particular types of information or particular topics to evaluated significance and assess impact. If impact is sufficiently significant, moves from scanning to searching.
  * informal search - actively looks to deepen knowledge and understanding of a specific issue. Relatively limited and unstructured effort to elaborate on an issue to determine if further action is required.
  * formal search - deliberate, planned effort to obtain specific information or information about a specific issue to systematically retrieve relevant information to provide a basis for decisions or a course of action.
* best practices for effective scanning
  * plan and manage scanning as a strategic activity - consider similar to R&D, long term (3-5 years to mature) effort to establish
  * implement scanning as a formal system - planned, sustained and coordinated.
  * partner with domain experts, information experts, and IT specialists in designing the scanning system - domain experts can help sort signal/noise, information specialists help add value to data and keep it accessible, and IT help move and share the information.
  * manage information as the core of the scanning function:
    * Information Needs: identify users and understand their information use
    * Information Acquisition: centrally coordinate, but distribute information gathering
    * Information Organization and Storage: centralized database/file system, organized to facilitate both searching (retrieving info) and browsing (connecting info)
    * Information Products/Dissemination: provide relevant context and other value-added services across a mix of dissemination channels and formats
    * Information Use: sensemaking, knowledge creating, and decision making
* Effective environment scanning balances control/creativity, centralization/decentralization, and focus/exploration.

## Reading: Cultural Contradictions... (Shultz)

* Focus Question from Schultz: how does understanding quality criteria for scanning is the opposite of what quality critera is for empirical science help you understand how to talk about, present and defend your scanning work.
* identifying conceptual conflict between evidence-based policy research and horizon (environmental) scanning
* scanning provides a more dynamic and faithful view of change, vs static things like briefings/white papers
* five key activities of integrated foresight:
  * trends, drivers, and emerging issues of change (weak signals) collected via scanning diverse data sources
  * change data extrapolated via statistical computation and qualitative impact assessment
  * change data, extrapolations, and impacts assembled into scenarios of possibilities
  * possibilities seen as desirable built into a preferred future, or vision
  * strategies to realize the vision devised building on positive trends and countering/ameliorating negatives
* after establishing a vision-based strategy, monitoring and updating it becomes part of the broader scanning/monitoring process
* when scanning:
  * first determine if it is objectively or only subjectly new (new to me vs new to a leading thinker)
  * determine if this is the first mention of a new change, or reinforces previous signals for the same topic
  * if it represents repitition, does it confirm or contradict?
  * try to judge how quickly the change is occurring and what the time horizon for "emergence" (public awareness/market saturation) might be
  * how credible is the source?
* many trends are established enough to already be a part of planning (ie globalization). Planning is the navigation map. Scanning is the radar that supplements the map with the current conditions on the ground.
* goal of scanning is to identify potentially significant change soon enough to monitor emergence while creating contingency plans to manage it, and with sufficient time to implement plans if needed.
* Four modes of scanning (Chun Wei Choo):
  * Touring, or undirected viewing, with no particular goal in mind across a wide variety of sources. Sensitizes to potentially significant change.
  * Tracking, or conditioned viewing, focuses on change items with potential impact to an organization or goal. Reviews pre-selected sources of relevance to the topic of interest.
  * Satisficing, or informal search, digs more deeply into a single issue or event, to determine quickly and efficiently if action is needed (which could include more formal research).
  * Retrieving, or formal search, in-depth research on a specific issue or event. Articulated methodology and exhaustive search for sources.
* Given the breadth needed on the touring end and the depth needed on the retrieving end, this is best performed by an integrated network of people.
* Choosing Touring/Horizon-Scanning Sources:
  * in science/technology, look for sources the communities use themselves to announce news
  * in social/cultural, look for ideas among artists and youth
* Validating Scanning Sources:
  * High citation numbers, media distribution, "buzz"
  * Market niche of material (look to mission statements and/or self descriptions)
  * Distribution: how widely distributed/used is it?
  * Media: print journal, newsletter, tabloid, etc
* Organizing Scanning Data:
  * STEEP: social, technological, economic, environmental, political
  * PESTLE: political, economic, social, techonological, legal, environmental
  * PESTLEC: political, economic, social, techonological, legal, environmental, culture
  * create, relate, consume, connect, define
  * broad categories can also be subdivided
  * folksonomies (if available)
* Validating Scanning Data:
  * Confirmation, or accruing multiple citations
  * Convergence, or emerging scientific consensus
  * Parallax, or acquiring "depth of field" by collecting views from multiple cultural viewpoints (both organizational and ethnic/cultural)

## Reading: Reframing environmental scanning: an integral approach (Voros)

* Focus Question from Schultz: how would Voros' perspective enhance or enlarge your approach to scouting for change?
* A broadened scanning framework, which may also provide understanding of how human minds filter their perceptions of the world.
* Cross-level analysis examines the world in terms of both the perceptual filters of the viewer and the aspect of the world being viewed.
* Based upon Four-Quadrant Integral model of Ken Wilber and Spiral Dynamics model of Don Beck and Chris Cowan.
* Four Quadrants based around Interior/Exterior, Individual/Collective:
  * UL, upper-left, intentional, subjective, "I", individual subjective awareness (hope, joy, dreams, cognitive capacities, intentions)
  * UR, upper-right, behavioural, objective, "it", objectively measurable aspects or behaviors of individuals
  * LL, lower-left, cultural, inter-subjective, "we", exchange of beliefs and experiences with others
  * LR, lower-right, social, inter-objective, "its", external interactions, most STEEP analysis is here
* Multiple levels radiating out from the center as: matter, body, mind, soul, spirit. Things progress to go up through them.
* Spiral Dynamics is a system for understanding how people think about things (ie the process), not simply the things they think about (ie the content).
  * Spiral Dynamics also sometimes described as "describing the containers that shape world views, not the contents that fill them"
  * Models evolution of human cognitive capacity as double-helix, one side is "life conditions" external to the individual and the other side are the cognitive capacities of the brain/mind system. Across the spiral, life conditions are matched with adequate coping mechanisms.
  * Describes an emergent system. Pairings are color coded (rather than ranked), with later ones tending toward more expansive, whereas earlier ones are needed to reach the later ones.
  * Spiral Dynamics structures:
    * Beige - archaic-instinctual - Survival Sense - 'do what you must do just to stay alive'
    * Purple - magical-animistic - Kin Spirits - 'keep the spirits happy and the tribe's nest warm and safe'

## Lecture

* What's the life-cycle of change?
* Where should we look for emerging change?
* How can we evaluate changes?
* What are some options for annotating scan hits?

* map isn't the territory, because territory is dynamic, need scanning (radar/sonar) to supplement the map
* scanning provides the essential feedstock for subsequent foresight activities
* Origins of environment/horizon scanning practices:
  * Environmental (horizon) scanning - developed by Francis Aguilar in Scanning the Business Environment. Widely accepted by business; linked to competitive intelligence
  * Issues management - fusion of PR and FS linking to public policy; Analysis of near-term issues and plans to address them
  * Emerging issues analysis: S-curve "life-cyle of change" (Molitor). Leading ideas, events, authorities/advocates, literature, organizations, political juridictions (bellwether), economic activities (shifts in production)
* foresight doesn't expect to understand particular problems better than experts, but rather to supplement with a broader, 360 degree view of things that may cause impacts
* key terms for scanning
  * scan source - where you found the change
  * emerging issue - a very young trend, with only a few cases
  * scan hit - a particular case of a trend
  * confirming hit - subsequent hits of a trend
  * trend - a direction of change in a variable over time, with a sufficient number of cases to back it up
  * megatrend - collection of similar trends which fit together into a broader idea. ie globalization is a collection of related trends
  * driver - a trend which is pushing changes
  * effect - the "so what" of a change
  * wild card - high impact, low probability events (sometimes also called black swans)
* life-cycle of change
  * nacent emerging issue: fringe thinking - foresight zone - art, science fiction, fringe writings, esoteric journals
  * early framing: academic exploration - innovation/early competition zone - research reports, think tank studies, scientific and technical journals, business leader magazines
  * rapid maturation: mainstreaming - reactive zone (strategy is about adapting to new emergence, cultural lag is most clear here) - TV, newspapers, popular general interest sources
  * established issue/trend: legislation, regulation - the new normal - government and institutional reports and studies, draft legislation
* how to horizon scan
  * identify potential sources
  * design framework/taxonomy to organize data (STEEP/PESTLE/EPISTLE, etc)
  * establish standards to evaluate scan data
  * initiate the database with 3-5 state-of-the-art overview of key issues of change
  * validate entries by structured accrual of confirming data
* Source acquisition: opinion leaders
  * science, technology, innovation: sources in which those communities themselves announce news. Often easy to find as expert sources have many degrees/credentials/etc.
  * social and cultural change: sources expressing values and ideas bubbling among artists, youth, marginalized communities; often 'fringe' publications or media.
* Validating sources: distinguish among expert, popular, or fringe sources. Establish credibility: citation count, market niche, distribution data, media.
* 4 modes (Choo)
  * touring - undirected viewing - minimal targeting, many sources; sensing.
  * tracking - conditioned viewing - minor targeting, few sources; sense-making.
  * satisficing - informal search - moderate targeting, few sources; learning.
  * retrieving - formal search - high targeting, many sources; retrieving.
* creating antenna arrays - requires powerful instruments to detect weak signals. Distributing the effort can allow more to be covered faster, and with more diverse perspectives. Connecting scanners/databases and/or croudsourcing can facilitate.
* search paths
  * snowball - let each citation lead you to multiple new citations
  * drunkard's walk - trace references from one article/post to the next
  * random ant approach - ie stumbleupon
* scanning outside the box (from Future Think)
  * diversify - expertize has limits - go outside your industry or field.
  * go global - escape the familiar - tap another worldview with sources from other countries
  * history is the future - look at the past to find the future - cycles, ideas that finally matured, etc.
  * year 2050 - search or your issue plus 2050 and see what search engines return
  * follow the futurists - get newsletters from various futures groups to hear their buzz
  * join the dialogue - look for communities/blogs on your issue(s) and join discussion/catch commentary
  * go ahead, contact them - email or call a leading thinker or advocate you've identified
  * be a customer - use a product or service from your client's industry - get the end-user experience
  * advisory boards - ask an eclectic group for review/input in your scan
  * search the patent office - what's in the pipeline for development
  * take a different route - break your own path habits walking to work
  * keep an idea journal - discipline yourself to capture your own ideas
  * get newsletters - sign up for newsletters of organizations related to your scanning issues
  * look at unrelated industries - look at everything tangentially linked to your issue, and scan industries in those areas too
  * active your toolbar - put favorite sources and blogs in your browser toolbar and take quick scan break
* gold standard for scanning
  * evaluate a scan "hit" (change datum): subjectely or objectively new? confirming/reinforcing, or negating/balancing? Time horizon for "emergence"? Credibility of source?
  * ideally a scan hit identifies an emerging issue that is objectively new even to experts, confirms or is confirmed by additional scan hits, and that has been identified in time for social dialogue, impact assessment, and policy formation.
* beyond scanning, how to categorize - Where is the change emerging? How fast will it mature? How widely will it disperse? How much impact will it have? How likely is it? etc
* analyzing scan data:
  * potential impacts: what could it do, to whom? express as trends, up or down
  * relevant impacts: what's important to your issue or client?
  * what kind of change is this: trend? event? cycle? idea?
  * triggers and dependencies: what might cause it? what does it need to grow or accelerate?
  * indicators: waht will signal this trend is either maturing, or fading?
  * impact areas: who will feel this trend first? Students? Elderly? Health institutions? The environment? The communications industry?
  * Links to other trends: to what other scan data does this trend connect? What pattern or cluster is emerging?
* validating scan data - useful scan hits are close enough to point of origin to allow policy leverage, are weak signals, often only one case
  * confirmation - accrue multiple citations
  * convergence - monitor emerging scientific consensus
  * parallax - acquire view from multiple perspectives
  * participatory team approach assists validation.

# W06: Timelines and Time Horizons

## Reading: Seeing in Multiple Horizons: Connecting Futures to Strategy (Andrew Curry, Anthony Hodgson)

* Three Horizons enables different futures and strategic methods to be integrated as and when appropriate.
* It can relate drivers and trends-based futures analyses to emerging issues, enable policy or strategy implications to be identified, and link futures work to process of change.
* The Horizons:
  * 1st Horizon - current prevailing system as it continues into the future, which loses "fit" over time as its external environment changes
  * 3rd Horizon - ideas/arguments about the future that are, marginal at best presently, but which have the potential over time to displace the world view of the first horizon because they representa more effective response to external environmental change
  * 2nd Horizon - an intermediate space of transition where 1st/3rd collide, which is typically unstable. Characterized by clashes of values in which competing alternative paths to the future are proposed by actors.
* An example:
  * Horizon 1: fossil fuels are dominant, energy is centralized and continuous. Companies may try to "clean" existing methods, or contradict/ignore framing of horizon 3.
  * Horizon 3: renewables, possibly also decentralized and reduced consumption. Emerging tech is championed, different energy-based business models are tried.
  * Horizon 2: significant public/fiscal support given to 3 and/or various demand reduction efforts.
* The time period covered by horizons will vary with the subject or domain under scrutiny. ie energy horizons are likely to be long (~50 years) due to significant infrastructure issues, whereas computer industry horizons would be much shorter.
* To challenge/replace horizon 1, horizon 3 futures need to overcome two challenges:
  * they need to show they can work at the required social scale
  * they need to win a battle of values (to overcome horizon 1, as well as to winn out among all viable horizon 3 alternatives)
* two axes are time (x-axis) and organizational fit with external environment, from low to high (y-axis)
* organizational fit can be assessed in terms of prevailing degree of acceptance of ideas within society as a whole about the political, economic, organizational and cultural norms embedden in an organization or network.
* trajectory of horizon 3 is deeply informed by values, and is strived toward using voice and experiment.
* One can envision the horizons as bell curves. Horizon 1 has already reached it's peak, Horizon 2 is rising up the first quarter of it's curve, and Horizon 3 is just getting started.
* Horizon 2 represents the space of conflict between Horizon 1 (present embedded social, economic, technical, and institutional structures) and Horizon 3 (value-driven desired future)
* Criticism of conventional scenarios: 1. frequently do not sufficiently critique underlying values and assumptions of the futures worllds they create. 2. Emphasis on 'important' drivers discourages paying attention to weak signals and emerging issues. 3. Presenting scenaries may discourage individuals from believing their actions can make a difference.
* Shell scenarios in particular suggest considering futures and being prepare to react, but not seeking to influence which future arrives.
* H3 mindset sees beyond our current system, motivated by vision, value, and beliefs. But it can be an uphill battle as social systems have a tendency to fight to remain the same.
* Three Horizons seeks to neither privelege H1 or H3, but to require an understanding of both. Conversely some other techniques seem to privilege one or the other.
* Three Horizons offers a framework to think beyond usual strategic limits, and see what conversations should be prompted by where their views may lie across the three curves.
* The intersection of the 3 curves defines a triangle of choice (generally around strategy or policy issues) as H1 falls away, H2 nears apex, and H3 continues to gain influence.
* May learn from social shaping theory as it applies to technology and related social ensembles:
  * (H3) 1st configuration: no dominant group and therefore no effective set of vested interests. if sufficient resources are available to a range of actors, there will be many different innovations
  * (H1)2nd configuration: one dominant group able to insist upon its definition of both problems and appropriate solutions. tendency toward conventional innovations
  * (triangle of choice) 3rd configuration: two or more entrenched groups with divergent technological frames. arguments carrying weight in one frame will carry little weight in others, such that criteria external to frames in question may become important as appeal are made to third parties (also likely to involve rhetoric as evidence)
* Early H3 will likely broaden coalition by 'enrollment', reframing interpretation to include new social groups.
* Where there is conflict between frames, some degree of amalgamation (adopting some elements) is likely to result within the successful frame.
* Notes from class:
  * How can timelines illustrate mindsets?
  * How can we represent conflicting values and priorities?
  * What does this highlight about current operating assumptions?
  * addressing overlapping waves of change and stability
  * both a timeline - moving forward in time - and a mindset map
  * Present assumptions (H1) become less fit for purpose over time in a context of dynamic change (H3), prompting turbulence and adaptive, creative actions (H2)
  * Key: simultaneity of perspectives and possibilities
  * Competition and clash: Between assumptions of the present and possibilities of the future. Between incrementalism and transformation. Between idealism and practicality.
  * Chronos - time passing; Kairos - opportunity for choices

## Reading: Understanding change through phases, eras, timelines (Mahaffie)

* timelines help us settle our understanding of the past and present to enable clearer thinking about the future
* defining groupings to use on the timeline provides a simplifying shorthand to discuss, argue, etc.
* we should be wary as some simplifications/shorthands are profoundly useful, while others are nonsense.
* Notes from class:
  * Why are timelines helpful?
  * Why should we consider the historical context of an issue?
  * timelines give people something to test, discuss, add their own ideas and emphases
  * identify watershed events and transitions can help develop a set of phases or eras to explain a trajectory of change

## Reading: Footprints of the Future (Von Stackelberg)

* Integrating quantitative time-oriented information into a unified presentation can reveal patterns, causes, probabilities, and possibilities across complex social, technological, economic, and political systems.
* Cycles, waves, logistics curves, and other archetypical patterns laid over historical data can also provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of change.
* Notes from class:
  * How does layering timelines assist our perception of change?
  * How can timelines assist identifying patterns and theories of change?
  * Depicting historical data and archetypal change patterns in parallel allows comparison of actual events with theoretical patterns.
  * Timelines identify different patterns of change: linear, exponential, asymptotic, growth/collapse, s-curves, cycles/waves, and chaotic transitions
  * Constructing a timeline:
    1. Plot events and time series data on the timeline
    2. Plot archetypal patterns of change
    3. Identify, investigate potential significant relationships/anomalies
    4. Extrapolate identified patterns and relationships
    5. Create exploratory forecasts.
    6. Identify tracking indicators.
    7. Analyze and assess validity of exploratory forecasts.

## Lecture

* often runs workshops through these in sequence: past timelines, three horizons, and emerging trends
* past change: shared histories
  * as you move further left, it tends to transition from what you experienced to what you have heard or were taught
  * these things build to define how we arrived where we are today
* 3 horizons
  * 1st horizon - current paradigms, assumptions, data, infrastructure
  * 2nd horizon - incremental adjustments, transformational experiments
  * 3rd horizons - present: pockets of the future -> far future: emerging paradigms, ideas, innovations
* Gartner Hype Cycle
  * Things move from left to right as they become more mature/usable, with interest peaking in advance of maturity, the trough following, and then a return toward prominence if there is enough value.
  * Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, Plateau of Productivity
  * Graph things on this, where each is marked based on when plateau will be reached: less than 2 years, 2-5 years, 5-10 years, more than 10 years
  * combines a timeline and pattern of change which seems to recur
* Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages (Carlota Perez)
  * Pattern of change: Installation period (20-30 years), Recession/Turning Point, Deployment Period (20-30 years), followed by next installation period
  * Installation Period: creative destruction, battle of new paradigm against old, concentration of investment in new-tech, income polarization, led by financial capital, from irruption to bubble collapse
  * Recessions: Institutional changes, role switches, turning point
  * Deployment Period: creative construction, widespread application of the new paradigm for innovation and growth across the economy, spreading of social benefits, led by production capital, from "golden age" to maturity
  * Examples: canal mania > great british leap; railway mania > the victorian boom; london funded global market infrastructure build-up > bell epoque/progressive era; the roaring twenties: autos, houses, radio, aviation, electricity > post-war, golden age; emerging markets, dot com and internet mania, financial casino > ? sustatianable global knowledge-society "golden age"

# W07: Systems and Interference Patterns

## Reading: On Systems Thinking (Ackoff)

* Focus Questions from Lecture:
  * What caused the transition from one worldview to the next?
  * What are the key differences between those two worldviews?
* Ages are defined by a period of time in which a culture has a single, shared view of the nature of reality.
* Fundamental beliefs of Renaissance: the universe is understandable, analysis is inquiry, everything can be explained by cause and effect.
* Analysis is inquiry led to a belief that understanding comes from breaking something down, understanding the parts, and then assembling an overall understanding. This led to a crusade to find the simplest element in every discipline as comprehension was thought to only be obtainable through a comprehension of the composing elements.
* Cause and effect, similar to reducing to elements in analysis, seeks to reduce relationships to this one simple kind of relationship. Implies both that the cause is necessary for the effect and that the cause is sufficient for the effect.
* Effects of cause and effect thinking: there has to be a first, all-encompassing cause, and that cause is God; Environmental factors are excluded as causal explanations for anything; nothing happens by change, all is predetermined
* Newton saw the world as a machine made by god to enact is will. If man is in god's likeness, then we should also build machines to enact our will, and thus the industrial revolution.
* Production and assembly lines are a direct outcome of reductionist thinking and mechanization. If we discover a way of thinking other than analysis, we should recognize it also implies different ways to organize and design work. By reducing work to elements and assigning some to humans (and some to machines), we make people behave as though they were machines.
* Machine Age dillema's: free will challenges cause and effect; Heisenberg uncertainty challenges understandability of the universe
* Systems: a whole that consists of two or more parts. Each part affects the behavior of the whole, depending on the part's interaction with other parts of the system. Essential properties that define any system are properties of the whole, and none of the parts have those properties. ie an automobile can carry us from place to place, but none of it's parts can in isolation. Finally, a disassembled system loses its defining characteristic. ie an automobile is not the sum of its parts, it is the product of the parts' interactions.
* Analysis is unable to consider systems, as they cannot be understood through their parts in isolation.
* Synthesis is the opposite of analysis. With synthesis you look to understand what larger system something is a part of and then to understand that larger system as a whole (rather than going smaller and smaller in synthesis). Finally, we would refine our understanding of the original object by identifying its role or function in the containing system of which it is a part.
* Analysis reveals how a system works, giving us know-how, or knowledge.
* Synthesis reveals why a system works the way it does, giving us understanding. ie why some cars are left hand drive vs right hand drive relates to things outside the car and steering wheel.
* Systems thinking is expansionist rather than reductionist, saying that to understand something we must grasp the larger system of which it is a part, but that we will never completely explain everything.
* Western religions envisions god as outside the universe, vs easter religions which see god AS the universe (and therefore ourselves as a part of god).
* Singer and producer-product "lens" argue that there are no universal laws, only environmentally relative ones. Further, cause and effect is a particular two-dimensional view, yet reality is multdimensional (so producer-product is complementary to cause and effect, not a replacement).
* Historical views of business are also mechanistic (machines to make money). Early companies were unable to grow as fast as possible, however without opening to public capital. WW2 brought people to work motivated by something other than money, bringing new expectations and attitudes.
* The industrial age was backed by machine age. The systems age is backed by information (and the manipulation of symbols): measurement, manipulation, and transmission.
* What does one get when you combine symbol reading, transmitting, and manipulation? our minds
* The industrial age was about muscle and mechanization. The systems age is about observe/communicate/think and automation.

## Reading: Intro to Systems Thinking (Kim)

* Focus questions from lecture:
  * What is the most critical element in a systems map?
  * What are two basic dynamics of change in systems?
* True systems thinking: know how systems fit into the larger context, how they behave, and how to manage them.
* System: any group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent parts that form a complex and unified whole that has a specific purpose. (without interdependencies, we just have a collection of parts)
* Note: whenever you add people to a collection, you almost always end up with a system. ie a kitchen is a collection of things, a kitchen with a person in it is a system.
* Defining Characteristics of Systems:
  * A system's purpose is a property of the system as a whole and not of any of the parts. ie moving people from place to place in the purpose of an automobile
  * All parts must be present for a system to carry out its purpose optimally, otherwise you are dealing with a collection.
  * The order in which the parts are arranged affects the performance of a system.
  * Systems attempt to maintain stability through feedback.
* Human designed things generally have a clear intended purpose, whereas living/natural systems evolve and their purpose can be difficult to ascertain.
* Contextualizing Systems with "The Iceberg" multiple levels of perspective (from top/narrow to bottom/wide):
  * Events - day-to-day occurences
  * Patterns - accumulated memories of events, which can reveal trends
  * Systemic Structures - the ways in which parts of a system are organized, which generate the patterns and events we observe. Note that structures can be physical (such as how something is built) or intangible (how individuals are rewarded).
* Additional levels of perspective:
  * Mental models - beliefs and assumptions about how the world works. Important to understand because they can provide a blueprint for the systemic structures that one finds.
  * Visian - a picture of what we want for our future. Determines themental models we hold as important as we pursue our goals.
* We live in an event-oriented world, and our language is largely rooted at this level.
* A cause and effect view tends to see events as separate and unrelated, even if they repeat. The feedback loop perspective instead says "how do the consequences of my actions feed back to affect the system?"
* How we describe our actions in the world affects the kinds of actions we take in the world. ie Feedback view draws attention to interrelationships, whereas cause-and-effect looks an event pairs.
* Cause and effect may work well to describe what happened when, but provides little insight in how things happened and why.
* Balancing Blocks of Systemic Behavior:
  * Reinforcing Processes: The Engines of Growth and Collapse. These come from positive feedback, where change leads to more change in the same direction. Often called things like "virtuous circle" or "vicious cycle".
  * Balancing Processes: The Great Stabilizers. Continually try to keep a system at some desired level of performance, generally to stabilize or goal seek. Most managerial responsibilities can be viewed, in one way or another, as balancing processes.
* Causal loop diagrams:
  * Arrow labels show how one variable influences another: `s` indicates that as one variable changes, the other changes in the same direction. `o` indicates that as one variable changes the other changes in the opposite direction.
  * Loop labels show what kind of loop we are looking at: `B` in the middle indicates a balancing process, `R` represents a reinforcing process.
  * You can determine `R` vs `B` by counting `o`s. If there are no `o`s or an even number, the loop is reinforcing. If there are an odd number, it is balancing.
* Balancing processes can be difficult as they mix the "good" (our goal), the "bad" (the actual situation we don't want), and the "ugly" (our perception of the situation, which may be challenging to examine).
* In looking at goal vs actual, we must remember that we are usually considering our perception rather that the actual value (and both of these may differ from other's perceptions). How to manage this? If you accept that it is better to be visible (rather than invisible) and explicit (rather than implicit), causal loop diagrams are a good first step.
* Delays add additional complexity to understanding. They come in 4 types:
  * Physical - time taken for actual "stuff" to move from one place to another or change from one state to another.
  * Trasactional - time it takes for things to complete.
  * Informational - time it takes to communicate information about physical changes or decisions.
  * Perception - time it takes for beliefs and assumptions to catch up with everything else.
* It's valuable to understand and consider the minimum delays in your system. Where are the bottlenecks? Speeding some delays may not help without shortening other delays first.
* Besides causal loop diagrams, we can also use stock and flow diagrams. Stocks (accumulators) are anything that accumulates and can be measured at a point in time. Flows (rates) are things that change over time. Unlike causal loops, stock and flow diagrams can provide information about rates of change.
* Systems thinking works from the central premise: if you don't know how you're producing certain outcomes, you'll struggle to produce better ones. Diagrams can how build shared understanding.
* Note that in balancing diagrams the gap may be omitted as a kind of shorthand, but it is still implicitly there.
* Systemic structures do not discriminate between virtuous and vicious spirals, it's up to us to anticipate which kind and respond appropriately.
* The issue in never whether our actions will have unintended consequences, but rather to what degree and what kind of consequences will they have? Causal loops can help us anticipate and adress problems before they arise.
* Systems thinking pushes us to consider working ON the system, rather than IN the system. How can we become better designers of systems, rather than mere operators?
* Levels of perspective framework can help us go beyond responding to look for higher leverage actions. From lowest to higher leverage, the levels of perspective and their action modes:
  * Events - Reactive: respond to events an they occur
  * Patterns - Adaptive: adapt processes to make best use of the current system
  * Systemic Structures - Creative: createngi or redesigning the system to change events and patterns
  * Mental Models - Reflective: surface, suspend, and question assumptions about how the world works and what is important (and invite others to do the same)
  * Vision - Generative: bringing something into being that did not exist before (can provide impetus to go through the discomfort of changing mental models)
* Note as one moves up these levels, you have more impact on future outcomes, but not much impact on present events. There are leverage at all levels, the challenge lies in learning when and how to take appropriate action for each level.

## Lecture

* Systems: key ideas
  * Every entity (thing is a system which consists of parts (subsystems) and which is also a part of larger systems -- a "holon" to use Arthur Koestler's term (1968).
  * Every system and every part of a system is connected to every other system, at least indirectly.
  * Systems and parts of a system interact in ways that can produce surprising and counterintuitive results.
  * The tendency to produce unexpected results makes predicting the outcome of systems' interaction difficult, if not impossible.
* Systems: characteristics
  * Systems have purpose.
  * All parts must be present for a system to carry out its purpose.
  * The order in which the parts are arranged affects the performance of a system.
  * Systems attempt to maintain stability through feedback.
* Systems Thinking: Start with a Story
  * What is the story that interests you? Who are the actors? How are they changing? What is the environment? How is it changing?
  * Identify key nouns. Which are variables?
    * Write each variable name on post-it, but DO NOT include how it varies.
    * Continue identifying variables, placing post-its on newsprint or wall. Which are key variables? Can any be clustered, or excluded?
  * Create the initial influence map
    * Choose what you think is an important variable. Does it influence any other variables? Draw arrows to show outgoing influence. Do other variables influence it? Draw arrows to show incoming influence.
* Current state of the system via influence map.
  * CATWOE can be a helpful checklist: Customers, Actors, Transformations, Worldviews or values, Owners, and Environment
  * STEEP may also be helpful.
* Emerging change and impacts - interference: Review trends and emerging changes. Whore do they hit the system? What variables will they affect? How will they affect connections and feedback?

# W08: Forecasting

## Reading: Blurred Vision (Gardner)

* Focus Questions from Class
  * How do we factor uncertainty in our thinking, and how does it hamper thinking?
  * What is the best strategy for improving forecasts?
* Look at almost any time period and you'll find people worried about the future and looking back to more certain times.
* "uncertainty illusion" rightly percieves future an uncertain, yet imagines the past is less so due to hindsight bias.
* predictability is not binary, there is a continuum. ie number of senior citizens there will be is rather predictable, price of oil much less so.
* Research shows that those who use a skill repeatedly without clear, prompt, accurate feedback may not get better, but they do get more confident. Lack of growth paired with growing confidence is a dangerous combination.
* Forecasting tournaments provide a concrete and explicit means of practicing forecasting and getting feedback.
* Good forecasters looked at problems from multiple perspectives, routinely saw the possibility of events unfolding in unexpected ways, and maintained a certain intellectual humility.
* Writing down a precise numeric forecast and why you believe it (ideally with an explanation as to why) provides practice and fights back against the uncertainty illusion/hindsight bias.

## Reading: Teaching the Future Ch7 (Hines,Bishop)

* Focus Questions From Class:
  * What supports forecasts -- and which of those is most important?
  * What is baseline forecasting and baseline analysis?
* Foresight tracks change toward two purposes: to map it and to influence it.
* Baseline forecasts extrapolate present conditions and trends into the future, also known as expected or surprise-free forecasts. It isn't really that likely, but it provides a good basis for discussion.
* Alternative forecasts are what happens when the baseline does not. Each is likely to be individually less probable than the baseline, but in aggregate they are more probable than the baseline.
* Forecasts taken together are represented as a cone, where as more time elapses the baseline becomes increasingly less probably and the size of the cone grows to map to this increasing uncertainty.
* Forecasts often help us understand the dynamics of change, even if they do not predict exactly what will happen or could happen.
* For good forecasting, discovering and challenging assumptions is critical.
* Forecasting is the process of discovering and describing plausible futures. Planning is combining that information with values, aspirations, preferences, needs and desires to design a way to infleunce the trajectory toward preferable outcomes.
* Forecasting Theory:
  * Forecasts are inferences (as the future can not be directly observed)
  * Any forecast can be wrong, just like other inferences (direct observations can be wrong as well, but is less likely)
  * Forecasts are supported using evidence and assumptions, and are not provable.
  * The weak link in supporting inferences are the assumptions required to use the evidence as support.
* Approach: Framework Forecasting - produces a baseline forecast as well as alternatives which can be explored for opportunities and threats
  * Characterize present era: start, conditions, and trends.
  * Explore forces of change, beginning with trends.
  * Introduce discontinuities, collected into dimensions of uncertainty: plausible events, emerging issues, and new ideas.
  * Categorize information as you find it, seeking to find the around the ten best items per category (number is arbitrary).
  * Final document as nine sections: domain definition, summary, current assessment, era analysis, baseline forecast, baseline analysis, alternative futures, scenario kernels, and information
  * In addition to trends, baseline future development is contributed to by: constants, plans, cycles, and projections.
  * Futures wheels can be used to investigate implications of futures. It places a focal change in the center, second-order changes around this, third-order around that, and so on.
  * Baseline analysis - rigourously arrive at alternative futures based on evidence and plausible reasons
    * Conduct research
    * Forecast baseline (expected) future
    * State evidence for baseline, such as constants, trends, plans
    * Challenge evidence:
      * Is it true? (ie no-one has a plausable reason to object to its truth)
      * Is it relevant? Does it support the inference?
      * Is it sufficient? Is the evidence strong enough to support the strength of the claim?
    * Identify assumptions that one must accept to use each piece of evidence which passed the challenge.
    * Challenge each assumption by stating its opposite, bringing to mind reasons the assumption might be true.
    * Identify plausible alternative assumptions.
    * Use alternative assumptions and reasoning as a foundation and extend plausible alternative futures.
  * Important to focus on plausible futures, not just possible ones.
  * Creativity is a companion to reasoned analysis. Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas. It is a skill that can be practiced and improved.
  * Innovation is the process of implementing creative ideas into useful solutions.
  * IDEA framework for creative problem solving:
    * Investigate needs - What is the problem/challenge?
    * Develop ideas - What are the ideas for solving it?
    * Evaluate solutions - Which are the best ones?
    * Activate plan - How can the best ideas be implemented?
  * Alternative futures techniques:
    * Judgement: Genius - Thinking, imagining; Visualization - Relaxation, stimulation of imagination; Role Playing - Act out one or more pre-arranged conditions; Coates & Jarratt - Define domain and time horizon, identify conditions or variables of interest, develop scenario themes, estimate values of conditions and variables under ecah scenario theme, write the scenarios.
    * Baseline: Manoa - Implications, cross-impacts, elaboration
    * Elaboration of fixed scenarios: Incasting - elaboration on specific domains; SRI - Specific domains in rows
    * Event sequences: Probability trees - sequence, assign probabilities; Sociovision - Cluster similar alternatives into macro themes; Divergence mapping - Place on one of four time horizons, link events in sequence; Future mapping - sequence events to create end-state
    * Backcasting: Backcasting, Horizon Mission Methodology - Steps that could lead to that end-state; Impact of Future Technologies - Highly capable scenarios, signposts leading to scenario, cost/benefit
    * Dimensions of uncertainty: Morphological analysis, Field anomaly relaxation - Multiple alternative for each dimension, link one alternative from each dimension; GBN (Global Business Network) - Select two most important and most uncertain, create 2x2 matrix, title and elaborate; Option development & evaluation - Multiple alternatives for each dimension, rate consistency of every alternative against every other alternative, perform nearest neighbor calculation; MORPHOL - Multiple alternatives for each dimension, link one alternative from each dimension, excluding impossible combinations and rating more likely combinations more highly. Can calculate probability of combination of probabilities.
    * Cross-impact analysis: Cross-impact analysis - initila probability of each, contingent probabilities of each given occurence of ecah other, Monte Carlo simulation; TFS - High, medium, low values of the variables, initual probabilities of each range, cross-impact of ranges from different variables on each other, Monte Carlo simulation; SMIC PROB-EXPERT - Initial probability of each, contingent probabilities of each given the occurrence of ecah other, correction of contingent probabilities for consistency, Monte Carlo simulation
    * Modeling: Trend impact analysis - Estimate impact of event on trend - time of initial impact, max impact, time of max impact, time of final impact; Sensitivity analysis - Enter multiple plausible values for each uncertain boundary condition, possibly Monte Carlo simulation; Dynamic scenarios - Build system model for each dimension, combine into one overall model
  * Questioning assumptions allows us to consider alternatives and remove the illusion of certainty or determinism.
  * Uncertainties: Trend reversals, unfulfilled plans, potential events, emerging issues, new ideas, key uncertainties (chosen based on degrees of impact and uncertainty)
  * Scenario kernels - pull together other information to develop scenarios around the most important and most plausible alternative futures.
  * Leading indicators are the focused information that show how uncertainty is resolving itself, so by finding and watching them we can see which alternatives we might be progressing toward. While we might normally scan, if we have identified leading indicators we can instead monitor (because we know where to look and what kinds of things to look for)
* Evaluating support for an inference:
  * Identify an important conclusion of the piece
  * Identify the evidence in the piece that supports the conclusion
  * Identify the assumptions required to use each piece of evidence
  * Reverse each assumption to create alternatives
  * Consider reasons that each alternative might be true
  * If there are such reasons, identify the modifications to the original conclusion or an entirely new conclusion that result if the alternative assumption is true
  * Make a judgement concerning the original conclusion and any other plausible conclusions that result
  * Synthesize them into one overall conclusion if possible

## Reading: Six Rules for Effective Forecasting (Saffo)

* Focus Questions from Class:
  * In using the cone of uncertainty, what makes a good boundary?
  * What should you embrace, and why? What should you discount, and why?
* Forecasters map uncertainty, with logic that can be articulated and defended.
* Rule 1: Define a Cone of Uncertainty - forecasting provides context to inform intuition.
  * The width/breadth of the cone relates to the degree of uncertainty, and should start wide and iteratively narrow.
  * A good boundary is one of elements on the ragged edge of plausibility, which might conceivably happen but make one uncomfortable even to contemplate.
  * Wild cards are trends or events that have a low probability of occurance (under 10%) or probabilities that cannot be quantified, but that if it were to occur would have a disproportionately large impact. ie finding evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe
  * Difficulty with wild cards is it is difficult to acknowledge sufficiently outlandish possibilities without losing your audience.
* Rule 2: Look for the S Curve - most important developments follow the S-curve shape of a power law, with change sarting slowly and incrementally, exploding, and eventually tapering off or even dropping back down.
  * Power curves are often fractal, if you see one it is likely related to a larger, more important curve in the background.
  * In forecasting the trick is to identify an S-curve before the inflection point.
  * There is a tendency to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term (Roy Amara). We hope revolution will arrive overnight, and when it doesn't our disspointment leads us to conclude it will never arrive -- right before it does.
  * We tend to underestimate the speed of the change through the exponential portion of the S-curve.
* Rule 3: Embrace the Things that Don't Fit - the best way to spot an emerging S-curve is to identify the things that don't fit, as anything truly new won't fit into existing categories.
  * Indicators often look like curiosities or even failures.
  * Indicators come in clusters. ie DARPA grand challenge, Roomba, etc point to a robotics inflection point.
* Rule 4: Hold Strong Opinions Weakly - lots of interlocking weak information is more trustworthy than a point or two of strong information.
  * forecast often, and be the first to prove yourself wrong, repeat
* Rule 5: Look Back Twice as Far as You Look Forward - "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes", by looking back at least twice as far we can look for patterns
* Rule 6: Know When Not to Make a Forecast - even in times of dramatic change, there are vastly more elements that do not change than new things that emerge. If the uncertainty is too great, and therefore the cone too wide, it may be a better time to wait for things to settle than to forecast.
  * Be skeptical about apparent changes, and avoid making an immediate forecast--or at least don't take any one forecast too seriously.

## The Forecasting Fallacy (Murrell)

* Focus Questions from Class:
  * How good are experts at forecasting?
  * Why do experts forecast?
* People are really bad at predicting recessions, GDP, interest rates, exchange rates, media spend, company earnings, TV punditry, stock prices, etc.
* We must be wary of things that are fantasies, rather than forecasts. ie "delusions with decimal places"

## Lecture

* Superforecasting, Tetlock
  * Triage the unforecastable - find the 'Goldilocks' zone.
  * Break problems down into the knowable and unknowable - 'flush ignorance into the open.'
  * Balance inside and outside views - find comparisons for even seemingly unique events: set up forecast parameters by analogy.
  * Update your beliefs - practice good mental hygiene even when it's uncomfortable, reflect and critique your assumptions. Pay attention and adapt when circumstance change.
  * Everything is connected - look for counterbeliefs, and inhabit their perspective while considering outcomes if they are correct.
  * Remove uncertainty by traslating it into numerical probabilities - 50/50, 60/40, 70/30 - with specific timelines - it aids evaluation.
  * Learn from failure and success - keep score in a forecasting journal.
* 6 types of Socratic Questions:
  * Clarifying Thinking & Understanding: Can you give me an example? Could you explain further? Are you saying...? What is the problem you are trying to solve?
  * Challenging Assumptions: Is that always the case? Are you assuming...? How could you verify or disprove that? What would happen if...?
  * Examining Evidence & Rationale: Why do you say that? How do you know? Why? What evidence is there that supports...?
  * Considering Alternative Perspectives: Are there any alternatives? What is the other side of the argument? What makes your viewpoint better? Who would be affected and what would they think?
  * Considering Implications & Consequences: What are the implications/consequences of...? How does that affect...? What if you are wrong? What does our experience tell us will happen?
  * Meta Questions: Why do you think I asked that question? What does ... mean? What is the point of the question? What else might I ask?

# W09: Critiquing Impacts of Change

## Reading: Causal Layered Analysis (Inayatullah)

* An effort to use poststructuralism as a research method to conduct inquiry into the nature of past, present and future.
* Existing mapping schemes: predictive - contextualizing data; interpretive - giving meaning to data; critical - locating in relation to historical structures of power/knowledge, ie class, gender, varna and episteme
* Goal is less to predict or compare, but to question the future. ie instead of population forecasts we might ask why population instead of community or people?
* Seeks to consider what paradigm is privileged by the nomination of a trend or event as a possible future.
* Using other ways of knowing, particularly from other civilizations, is one way to create distance from the present.
* Concept: Desconstruction - take a text and break it into components, asking what is visible and invisible. ie Who is privileged at the level of knowledge? Who gains at economic, social and other levels? Who is silenced? What is the politics of truth? Which future is privileged? Which assumptions of the future are made preferable?
* Concept: Geneology - history of which discourse have been hegemonic and how the topic of study has traveled through these discourses. ie Which discourses have been victorious in constituting the present? How have they traveled through history? What have been the points in which the issue has become important or contentious? What might be the genealogies of the future?
* Concept: Distance - treat scenarios less as forecasts and more as critiques of the present. ie Which scenarios make the present remarkable? Make it unfamiliar? Strange? Denaturalize it? Are these scenarios in historical space (the futures that could have been) or in present, or future space?
* Concept: Alternative Pasts ond Futures. ie Which interpretation of past is valorized? What histories make the present problematic? Which vision of the future is used to maintain the present? Which undo the unity of the present?
* Concept: Reordering Knowledge - focus on how categories order knowledge. ie How does the ordering of knowledge differ across civilization, gender and episteme? Whot or Who is othered? How does it denaturalize current orderings, making them peculiar instead of universal?
* We should also consider the myths and metaphors we use and that others use, and how these influence the futures we imagine.
* Causal layered analysis levels:
  * 1 - Litany - Quantitative trends, problems (often exaggerated, often used for political purposes). Events, issues and trends are not connected and appear discontinuous. Results in feelings of helplessness, apathy, or projected action. Believed, rarely questioned.
  * 2 - Social - Social causes, including economic, cultural, political and historical factors. Intepretation is given to quantitative data. Data is questioned, but not the paradigm in which the issue is framed.
  * 3 - Discourse/Worldview - Structure and the discource/worldview that supports and legitimizes it. Seeks to find deeper secial, linguistic, and cultural structures that are actor-invariant. Discerns deeper assumptions. Foundation for how the litany has been presented and variables used to understand the litany are questioned.
  * 4 - Myth/Metaphor - Unconcious assumptions of how the world is or should be.
* Each layer results in different types of scenarios. Litany - instrumental; Social - policy; discourse/worldview - fundamental differences; myth/metaphor - poems/stories/images.
* Each layer also implies different actors. Litany - others, such as government or corporations; Social - partnerships between groups; discourse/worldview - people or voluntary associations; myth/metaphor - leaders or artists
* CLA can categorize many different perceptions of realities while remaining sensitive to horizontal and vertical spaces.
* CLA orients toward action learning and integrated methodologies. Answers are not right or wrong, rather dialogue is used to recognize multiple ways of knowing between different levels. The interaction between the levels and ways of knowing is key to understanding different possibilities.

## Reading: Futures Wheel (Glenn)

* Structured brainstorming, method of identifying and packaging secondary and tertiary consequences of trends and events
* Trend or event is written in center of paper, with spokes to primary impacts or consequences, then further spokes to secondary consequences and so-on until a useful picture of implications is clear.
* Possible questions to elicit impacts/consequences: "If this event occurs, then what happens next?", "What necessarily goes with this event or trend?", "What are the impacts or consequences?".
* After an initial diverse/broad set of ideas, it can be pared back based on what is "realistic", more probable, etc. This helps clarify.
* Mind mapping is similar, but seeks to radiate out in a linear fashion, whereas futures wheels complete each ring in concentric circles.
* Alternatively, instead of rings one can draw single lines to primary impacts, doubled lines to secondary, tripled to tertiary, etc. This better allows for cross linkage.
* Further, can be used to build alternative scenarios, by using each layer to consider something implied by an alternative and what it would require to come about.
* Strengths:
  * easy and enjoyable, no equipment/software needed.
  * Can be used at any point in the process.
  * Can identify positive and negative feedback loops (which can help in developing systems model).
  * Helps move from linear, hierarchical, and simplistic thinking toward more network-oriented, organic, and complex thinking.
* Weaknesses:
  * Bigger/more complex wheels can become overwhelming before patterns emerge
  * Can yield contradictory impacts (could also be a strength, depending)
  * No better than the collective judgement of participants.
  * Can fool people into thinking they understand causal relationships that are only correlations.
* Futures wheel generates input to futures thinking, and should be used as a basis for further thinking, more systematic exploration, and application of other techniques for probing the future.
* Version 2 adds a requirement that impacts be considered for a predetermined set of areas to try and force more diverse ideas (ie STEEP)
* Version 3 could distinguish historic forces, current impacts, and future consequences (possibly with a different team for each time period).

## Lecture

* VERGE Framework
  * Define - the concepts, ideas, and paradigms we use to define the world around us
  * Connect - the technologies used to connect people, places and things
  * Consume - the ways in which we acquire and use the goods and services we create
  * Relate - social structures and relationships which link people and organizations
  * Create - the processes and technology throug which we create goods and services
  * Destroy - the ways in which we destroy value and the reasons for doing so
* VERGE focuses on the area of impact, as opposed to STEEP which focuses on the origin of impact
* Causal Layered Analysis (CLA)
  * Litany: official public description of the issue - events; trends; problems; "word on the street" - ie marriage: climbing divorce rate; more single parent & "blended" families; more cross-cultural, cross-church, and alternative marriages; more commuting marriages
  * Causes: social science and systems analysis - structures; interrelationships; systems; policy analysis, technical explanations, role of the state and interst groups - ie marriage: fragmentation of communities; wedding (party) no longer linked to marriage (commitment); AIDS epidimic >> monogamy = safety
  * Worldview - culture; values; paradigms/mental models; how language frames / constrains the issue - ie marriage: be fruitful -- and be sanctified; purity, commitment, monogamy, fidelity, childrearing; double standards; "old man/lady", "breadwinner", "home-maker", etc
  * Myth/Metaphor - collective archetypes; gut/emotional responses; visual images - ie marriage: adam and eve; the great mother; american gothic; someone for everyone -- but only one; cake, dance, ring; security vs fear of commitment
* CLA Process - work down through layers, consider alternate myth/metaphors and then revist earlier layers until you reach new set of events/behaviors comprising an entirely new litany
* CLA Timescales - Continuous = Problem/Litany - Years = Causes - Decades = Worldview - Societal/Civilizational = Metaphors/Myths
* Futures Wheels - see notes above.
  * be specific, be vivid, be provocative

# W10: Exploring Alternative Futures, 1

## Reading: The Four Futures (Dator)

* Focus Questions From Class:
  * What's useful about the 'four futures' archetypes?
  * What's the most important thing for people to do asy they begin an 'incasting' exercise with the four futures?
* continuation, collapse, discipline, transformation
* components of futures visioning for groups/communities:
  * Appreciating the past - seek to understand the rationale for something coming into existence and the many different facets of it's past.
  * Understanding the present - problems and possibilities. Valuable to get this down/out of the way to free people to think about futures.
  * Forecasting aspects of the futures - possible challenges and opportunities, roughly 20-50 year horizon. Built around shared sense of what is likely to be "new", as well as what to bring forward.
  * Experiencing alternative futures - an experience in one or more of at least four alternative futures
  * Envisioning the futures - envision a preferred future for the community or group 20-50 years hence
  * Creating the futures - what do do now and in what sequence in order to move toward the preferred future
  * Institutionalizing futures research - establish something to keep this thinking and work going within the community/group
* Goals of four futures exercise:
  * have people experience at least one future substantially different from the present to break out of projection thinking
  * honor and experience images of the future people actually hold today, and consider how we might thrive in them
  * consider what may be preferable or undesirable about a specific future, and what can be done to move toward or prevent
  * encourage movement beyond presented alternative futures to develop collectively-preferred alternatives (or adopt and start progressing toward one of the presented options)
* Four Futures Framing: ideally have four separate rooms, one for each future. Decorated to depict that future, with artifacts/decorations/actors (or at least a written description).
* Note: only give participants the future they will participate in initially, wait to share the alternatives until after the exercise.
* Four futures - accept as a given that a particular future is true, and explore how you can best exist in it. Discussion topics:
  * General discussion - What will people be doing? What STEEP problems will be gone or relatively minor? What new STEEP problems will be present that are absent or unimportant now?
  * How probable is the described future?
  * How preferable is the described future?
  * What are five things your group could do to pursue desirable aspects of the future?
  * What are five things your group could do to avoid undesirable aspects of the described future?
* The four futures:
  * Continuation or continued/renewed growth - "official" view of governments, education systems, and organizations.
  * Collapse - some cause or another (or their combination) leads to extinction or at least some lower stage of development than present. This might be just the scope of particular community/group also, rather than global.
  * Discipline - refocus economy and society on survival and fair distribution, rather than continued economic growth.
  * Transformation - focuses on transformative power of technology

## Reading: Overview of Current Scenario Techniques (Bishop, Hines, Collins)

* Focus Questions From Class:
  * What are different starting points for scenario building?
  * What are the various goals / purposes of using scenarios?
* Scenario techniques:
  * Judgement (genius forecasting, visualization, role playing, Coates and Jarratt) - assert without much if any methodological support.
  * Baseline/expected (trend extrapolation, Manoa, systems scenarios, trend impact analysis) - project present into future
  * Elaboration of fixed scenarios (incasting, SRI) - explicit consideration of predeveloped scenarios to produce simplest statement of what the scenario is about.
  * Event sequences (probability trees, sociovision, divergence mapping) - build a tree where branches depict probabalistic divergence of events in the future
  * Backcasting (horizon mission methodology, Impact of Future Technologies, future mapping) - envision a future, then work backwards to the present.
  * Dimensions of Uncertainty (morphological analysis, field anomaly relaxation, GBN, MORPHOL, OS/SE) - identify specific sources of uncertainty and use how they might play out as the basis for alternative futures.
  * Cross-impact analysis (SMIC PROF-EXPERT, IFS) - a grid of possibilities is built, such that individual and contingent probabilities are shown. Random values between 0 and 1 are assigned many times to determine likely probabality amounts for different possibilities.
  * Modeling (trend impact analysis, sensitivity analysis, dynamic scenarios) - look at expected value of a target variable at different time horizons. Vary these inputs and/or structure of models to generate predictions.

## Reading: Roads Less Travelled (Curry, Schultz)

* Focus Questions From Class:
  * Why are multiple approaches for scenario building useful?
* Seeks to compare outcomes of four scenario approaches: 2x2 deductive, causal layered analysis, the Manoa method, and scenario archetypes. Considers:
  * degrees of difference and depth of described futures
  * how clear of a narrative emerges, and how well it describes the path of things leading to this future
  * how participatory the process is, and what is the quality of engagement
* 2x2 'double uncertainty' analyze driving forces, identify critical uncertainties, then explore outcomes of combining uncertainties to build scenarios.
  * Axes should not influence one another, should represent the most important and uncertain drivers. Scenarios should be built by combining uncertainties.
  * Pros: Does not require as much skilled facilitation, can provide clear audit trail from drivers to axes and scenarios.
  * Cons: insufficiently problematizes current idealogies and sees them as natural
  * Insights: heavy reliance on getting axes "right", individual axes tend to repeat in a given domain (though not usually pairs), consistency of tone/perspective across scenarios
  * Results: coherent, cohesive scenarios with difference enough to provide stragic insight, but not different enough to startle or provoke.
  * Scenarios: tend to target the same organizational level, more of a 'snapshot' view
* Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) - analyze across layers of litany, systems, worldviews and metaphor.
  * Cons: need more prepared/shared context
  * Pros: can challenge worldviews with different cultural perspectives to break away from baseline
  * Insights: more likely to draw on historical/philosophical/cultural references, can be hard to get all the way through the layers before getting into scenario development, didn't appear to need to reach 'metaphor' layer at all to succeed, scenarios qualitatively different from 2x2
  * Results: Dug into and uncovered deep cultural structures, usually more of a snapshot
  * Scenarios: target a broad spectrum of scales
* Manoa - choose 3-5 significant emerging issues, mindmap them to potential cascades, consider cross-impacts, doublecheck depth using ethnographic inventory, develop a summary metaphor or title
  * Cons: requires identifying appropriate weak signals
  * Insights: scenarios encompass more detail about contradictions and tensions in the future, does not address the topic directly, high energy in early steps
  * Results: Creative and effective at producing vidid, provocative detail and generating difference, but lacking in depth (perhaps due to time constraints)
  * Scenarios: target a broad spectrum of scales and sectors, show 'chain' of how future is generated
* Archetypes (incasting) - participants are presented with general scenarios and asked to add creative, logically consistent details.
  * general scenarios: continued growth, ideological exclusionism (disciplined), Environmental Sustainability, High Tech Transformation, Spiritual Transcendence, and Collapse
  * Insights: to use archetypes participants must deepl yunderstand them
  * Results: potentially useful at generating difference (in more favorable circumstances), but unlikely to be as deep as CLA
  * Scenarios: predominantly at one scale (national), usually more of a snapshot

# W11: Exploring Alternative Futures, 2

## Reading: Appendix, The Art of the Long View (Ogilvy, Schwartz)

* GBN Scenario Building Process
* Step 1: Identify Focal Issue or Decision - take a few minutes to jot down some critical decisions facing your company or organization, review, discuss, and chose one via straw poll.
* Step 2: Key Factors in the Local Environment - take 15 minutes to brainstorm components of the situation about which you are making a decision.
* Step 3: Identify Driving Forces - what macro-environment forces will influence the local forces you just identified. One of:
  * Identify STEEP trends.
  * Take  afew minutes and ask what are the forces behind factors identified in step two.
* Step 4: Rank Driving Forces by Importance and Uncertainty - review driving forces, discuss their degree of importance for the focal issue and their relative uncertainty. You are looking for the most important and the most uncertain. Focus on 3 or fewer main issues.
* Step 5: Selecting Scenario Logics - After identifying "axes of crucial uncertainties", arrange them as a spectrum/continuum (one axis), a matrix (two axes), or a volume (three axes).
* Step 6: Fleshing out the Scenarios - Give each key factor and trend some attention in the context of the plot. Reveal connections and implications. Explore how the world gets from here to there.
* Step 7: Implications - How does the decision look in each scenaria? How would stakeholders change under each scenario? Describe: Opportunities, Allies, Threats, Competitors.
* Step 8: Selection of Leading Indicators and Signposts - What additional data do you need on the local environment and macro-environment? What variables might make good indicators of the direction of change? Identify a few observable and measurable trends which you can moniter as bellwethers of critical change.

## Reading: The Future is Not Binary (Schultz)

* Lecture Focus Questions:
  * How does Manoa differ from the 2x2 approach, and why?
  * What are the basic building blocks for each scenario you build using Manoa?
* seeks to "revel in the opportunity spaces that uncertainties reveal", as opposed to 'managing uncertainty'
* goals: participatory, firmly based in data, map steps from present, include multiple drivers of change, and depict different surprising outcomes with a time horizon of approximately a generation.
* Relates to Dator's Second Law of Futures Thinking - "the only useful ideas about the future should appear to be ridiculous"
* Step 1: Identify three emerging issues of change and state them as mature conditions 20-30 years out (each should be from a different STEEP categories). The more orthogonal the changes are in topic/direction, the more surprising/creative the results.
* Step 2: Create a futures wheel based on each change, having 5-7 primary impacts, each of which having 3 secondary impacts, and any tertiary impacts that may spring to mind.
* Step 3: Map the influences and interconnections between the futures wheels. A cross-impact matrix can assist.
* Step 4: Probe more deeply, considering different aspects of reality, such as: family structure, community, economy, governance, work, arts and leisure, vices and crimes, ecology and the environment, media ad community, transportation, education, subcultures, religion and myths, core values, worldviews, and paradigms.
* Step 5: Characterize your infant scenario. ie imagine 2-3 headlines, a bumper-sticker, or the title if it were a film/documentary.
* Step 6: Build the emerging narrative - a 'day in the life' is easiest.
* Step 7: Doublecheck the imaginative 'stretch'. Have you exagerrated to the point of absurdity? Have you challenged your assumptions? Have you combined changes/imparcts to distort something familiar? Have you reversed constraints/threats or strengths/opportunities?
* Step 8: Ask the practical questions. ie what are your current activities, plans, missions, vision? How would these play out in the scenarios? Which patterns/themes from the scenarios would most impact mission and vision? Which scenario offers the most opportunities? Which offers the most challenges? How might things need to evolve/transform to thrive in each scenario?

## Lecture

* Manoa: designed to maximize evidence-driven difference from present to challenge assumptions, focus on turbulence and dynamics of acceleration and constraint, surface emerging tensions and backlash responses
  * Needs at least three orthogonal changes to drive each scenaria
  * does not directly address topic (still need to incast later)
  * Impact cascades create clear webs of events - aids drafting a 'network' future history; cross-impact step addresses boundary spaces
  * Cross-impact step addresses boundary spaces where innovations and threats emerge
  * Energizing: creates a 'playful' mood supporting creativity
  * Mimicking genius:
    * identify three or more disparate, orthogonal emerging changes, ie, from three different STEEP categories
    * take each and imagine it's impacts
    * chase impact chains
    * ID cross impacts
    * ID interconnections that form amplifying / accelerating loops
    * ID backlashes and contradictions that create balancing / slowing loops & conflict
* Scenario Archetypes: Continued Growth, Ideological Exclusionism, Environmental Sustainability, High Technology Transformation, Spritual Transcendence, Collapse/Reversal
  * Capture common 'families' of images of the future to enable 'incasting'; pre-fab worldviews and frameworks provide "just add data" approach
  * requires nuanced understanding of archetypes, and can cause "not our story" backlash
  * Useful discussions generated when sorting data across archetypes, identifies ambiguities where drivers fall across or between boundaries
  * tight focus on the research issue
  * Scenarios vs Nightmare:
    * Business as Usual || Continued Growth vs Economic Collapse
      * capitalist, promotes the material, win-lose, reductionist, mechanistic; tech innovation and progress should be rapid and encouraged as it drives economic growth. Social/political change should be incremental and rule/law based, to promote stability. Environmental change is ignored/not noticed.
    * Environmental Sustainability vs Ecological Collapse
      * communitarian, promotes the natural, win-win, holistic, organic; tech change should be incremental and assessed to promote stability. Environmental change should occur unaffected by human activity. Social, political, and economic change should be incremental and driven by goal of increased hormany with nature, with political/economic instracture adapting to, and supporting that goal.
    * Ideological Exclusionism vs Anarchy (collapse of rule of law)
      * hierarchic, promotes the rule, win-exclude, limiting, disciplined; distrust change, it should only occur incrementally, well controlled by rule of law, to promote stability of belief.
    * High Tech Transformation vs Infrastructure/System Collapse
      * anarchic, promets the outer journey, win-evolve, transformational, invented; thrive-on/addicted-to change in all sectors at all speeds to promote tranformation faster. Innovations will completely transform social, economic, and political structures, and destrys very notion of "natural", while helping to control negative impacts.
    * Spiritual Trancendence vs Anomic Collapse
      * collegially selfless, promotes the inner journey, win-enlighten, transcendent, noetic; social change should support social advances and noetic evolution. Tech and economic change should be incremental and slow, to de-emphasize the material. Change in political sphere should be incremental but innovative, retaining stability but promoting trancendent social values and networks.

# W12: Designing Experiential Futures

## Reading: Experiential Futures: Stepping into OCADU's Time Machine (Candy)

* Goal is "diagetic integrity", that the scenario holds together on it's own terms: no gaps in logic, no clumsy flashing arrows.
* Part of the trick is putting people into your diegesis - your story-world - as seamlessly as possible.
* diagetic integrity forces us to imagine the future at hand more concretely, coherently, and compellingly than we otherwise would.
* seeks to push beyond talk/text to tell provide a more compelling narrative

## Reading: Designing an Experiential Scenario: The People Who Vanished (Candy, Dunagan)

* Experiential futures seek to bring material and emotional reality to scenarios so that they will be more impactful.
* key challenge of next generation is not generating/broadcasting ideas, but to design circumstances/situations in which collective intelligence and imaginiation of a community can come forth.
* Experiential futures ladder (from abstract/general to concrete/specific)
  * Setting - kind of future, top level descriptor
  * Scenario - specific future history or state
  * Situation - 1:1 scale, visitable respresentation of time and place
  * Stuff - artifact or instantiation
* Ladder uses layers to orient participants to the elements that were fixed (location/setting, broad theme, timing), and why.
* Ladder helps make apparent which elements are still open and need collective attention and definition.
* Ladder seeks to bring into being different worlds as our attention comes to them.

# W13: Values and Preferred Futures

## Reading: Envisioning the Future (Ziegler)

### Principles

* the future is not the domain of knowledge, but of action - visioning should empower participants to take action in the present to bring about the future
* the future is a metaphor for the human imagination - if does not objectively exist - it also begs the qusetion of whose imagination we are talking about
* participants in imagining form a community of learners characterized by:
  * readiness (and learned competence) to take risks with each other by sharing compelling visions of the future, especially when there are substantial differences among the images
  * readiness to de-role so that they deep-listen with each other even when they disagree and are in serious conflict
  * readiness to search for shared vision without losing or giving up the integrity of their own compelling images
* participtaion is by invitation, envisioners have to want to do it - this makes it quite challenging for heirchical organizations, as the generated images will not be owned and committed to in the same way, and will therefore not lead to changed action or practice
* the only player in envisioning is the person, not the organization or the community.

### Contextual Protocols

* Dissatisfaction - starting point of envisioning. Something dissatisfying about the present from which a future image can be generated for which the dissatisfaction is well addressed. Possibly the pain behind this dissatisfaction can also be shared. The dissatisfaction should be namable to drive focus and mobilize engergy to imagine how things might be different.
* Participation - more diverse groups produce a more robust environment of images. The future is full of surprises, and the more diverse the group, the more likely images will also have surprises. Helps move us beyond expected and accepted.
* Commitment to Action - lacking this will disconnect participants from intention to act upon the present in order to move toward the future. Those leading the envisioning must also be open to the outcome, whether they expect/like it or not, or it will undermine the effectiveness and value of the effort.

### Methods and Practices

* Discerning of Concerns - Deep questioning and deep learning to penetrate to the sources, reasons, meanings, effects of their concerns, dissatisfaction, problems, and pain.
* Focused Imaging - five levels of focused imaging
  * first three lay out indicators, positive, and negative consequences of the images as achieved states of affairs. Participants learn to live in the future present moment to subject their images to discerning tests.
  * fourth layer invites participants to dig out underlying assumptions without which images would make no sense, examine values implicit in living out images, and provide rationales behind images.
  * fifth layer partipants undertake an inner search to discover one or more compelling images they are prepared to share with the community of learners
* Creating Shared Vision - split into small groups who share at a minimum a focus of concern, possibley a common theme, and sometimes even an image. This group then builds a comprehensive scenario. Participants learn and practice intentioning, discerning and dialogue to negotiate agreements. Each team lays out as many ramification, implications and meanings as they can. All participants then device a 'future matrix' of all the domains and areas from all the subgroups. Building this matrix often yields elements of a shared vision.
* Connecting the Future with the Present - working individually and in teams connec tthe future by living their images as achieved and actualized, and remembering how that happened. (futures-history)
* Strategy Paths and Action - in various kinds of groupings, participants discover strategy paths and actions which will, in their judgement, move them well and truly toward and into their futures

## Lecture

* Five Key Activities of Integrated Foresight
  * Identify & Monitor Change - Identify patterns of change: trends in chosen variables, changes in cycles, and emerging issues of change.
  * Critique Change - Examine primary, secondary, tertiary impacts; inequities in impacts; differntial access, etc.
  * Imagine the Possible - Identify, analyze, and build alternative images of the future, or 'scenarios'.
  * Envision the Preferred - Identify, analyze, and articulate images of preferred futures, or 'visions'.
  * Plan & Implement - Identify stakeholders, resources; clarify goals; design strategies; organize action; create change.
* Futures Studies seek to act to enhance the probability of our preferable futures.
* "Scenarios are futures for the head ... visions are futures for the heart." - Clem Bezold
* Effective visions inspire action
  * Vividly, boldly portray hopes, ideals, and values.
  * Clearly identify the time horizon
  * Describe a "future history" of actions and projects that created the improved "present"
  * Are written in the present tense, as if the preferred future were real now
  * Contain a few transformed elements of the "past" - 2020 - to contrast the "past" with the vision's improved present day
* Vision + Leadership > Models
  * (Robert Greenleaf) Servant Leadership - Great leaders serve the group they lead, by creating and maintaining an environment which encourages and supports everyone in maximizing their potential, especially vis-a-vis group goals.
    * by healing broken spirits and emotional hurts; by listening intently to others and one's own inner voice; by being awake to values, ethics - and the disturbing; by practicing foresight - the intuitive grasp of potential future outcomes; by conceptualizing and articulating a dream; by persuading rather than commanding: convincing; by accepting and recognizing others - empathy; by commitment to the growth of people; by building community; and by practicing stewardship
  * (James MacGregor Burns) "Leadership over human beings is exercised when persons with certain motives and purposes mobilize, in competition or conflict with others, institutional, political, psychological, and other resources so as to arouse, engage, and satisfy the motive of followers. ... in order to realize goals mutually held by both leaders and followers."
    * Transactional leadership - occurs when one person takes the initiave in making contact with others for the purpose of an exchange of valued things
    * Transformational leadership - occurs when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality
  * (Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus)
    * Leaders lead by pulling rather than pushing; by inspiring rather than ordering; by creating achievable, though challenging, expectations and rewarding progress toward them rather than by manipulating; by enabling people to use their own initiative and experience rather than by denying or constraining their experiences and actions.
    * Four strategies:
      * attention through vision - creating focus with a mental image of a possible and desirable future
      * meaning through communication - influencing, organizing, and sharing meaning within the group
      * trust through positioning - clearly, consistently, and reliably communicate and stick with your position
      * deployment of self through 1) positive self-regard and 2) the Wallenda factor: 1) know your own worth; continually develop your skills, and 2) keep trying.
  * (James M. Kouzes and Barry Z Posner) - Five leadership practices and ten commitments:
    * Challenging the process - Search for opportunities & Experiment and take risks
    * Inspiring a shared vision - Envision the future & Enlist others
    * Enabling others to act - Foster collaboration & Strengthen others
    * Modeling the way - Set the example & Plan small wins
    * Encouraging the hears - Recognize individual contribution & Celebrate accomplishments
  * (Kotter)
    * Eight-Stage Process of Creating Major Change
      * Establish a sense of urgency
      * Create the guiding coalition
      * Develop a vision and strategy
      * Communicate the change vision
      * Empower broad-based action
      * Generate short-term wins
      * Consolidate gains and produce more change
      * Archor new approaches in the culture
    * Leadership means:
      * establishing direction - developing a vision of the future, and the strategies to create it
      * aligning people - communicating direction in words and deeds to everyone whose cooperation is needed to create the vision
      * motivating and inspiring - energizing people to ovecome major political, bureacratic, and resource barries to change by satisfying basic, but often unfulfilled, human needs.

### Visioning Techniques

* meditative visualization
  * share worst fears - convert to best hopes
  * indiviual meditative visualization >>> poster
  * find fellow travellers by 'touring' individual visions
  * self-identified working groups synthesize from individual to collective by collating shared goals, what they admire

  * backcast - detail specific events necessary to achieve
* critique / fantasy / implement
  * designed to improve squatter's communities, assumes no resources
  * prepare - all stakeholders, rules of play
  * solve a present problem, identify via a catharsis
  * fantasize a visionary solution
  * implement by accepting design constraints of minimal resources to spur local creativity
  * commit by signing up to act, with a deadline
* appreciative inquiry - build on strengths & successes
  * Definition - frame the intervention
  * Discovery - What is good? What has worked?
  * Dream - What might be?
  * Design - What should be? What is ideal?
  * Destiny - How to make it happen? (feeds back to discovery and/or definition)
* past, present, ideal future - ACT
  * shared history timeline
  * external trends and current and possible future responses
  * prouds and sorries re: topic or problem
  * ideal future described as if it were accomplished
  * identify and confirm common ground
  * commit by signing up to act, with a deadline
* Causal Layered Analysis (CLA)
* Verge - How should we...? on 6 dimensions
  * How should we define ourselves and the world around us? What should our values, paradigms encompass?
  * How should we connect people places and things, and transmit value and meaning?
  * How should we acquire and use the goods and services we create?
  * How should we relate to other people, to organizations and communities, and to nature?
  * How should we create goods, services, and socila roles?
  * How should we destry value and what should be our reasons for doing so?

# W14: Imagination to Action

## Reading: Leverage Points (Meadows)

* leverage point - place within a complex system where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything
* It seems common that organizations know where the leverage point is, but misinterpret it and are pushing in the wrong direction.
* Places to intervene in a system (in increasing order of effectiveness)
  12. Constants, parameters, numbers (subsidies, taxes, standards). Can be important in the short term and to directly impacted people, but rarely change behavior. That said, critical parameters that impact things lower in the list can cause big changes.
  11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows. Buffers can be very impactful, but are on the low end of the spectrum because they are so costly to change.
  10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures). The only way to fix a system that is laid out wring is to rebuild it, but often you can't (too slow/expensive).
   9. The length of delays, relative to the rate of system change. Feedback and/or response delays are common causes of oscillations. More critical relative to rates of change in system state the feedback loop is trying to control. Can be powerful to change, but this is often difficult or impossible (easier to alter rate of change).
   8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against. Strength of negative feedback loop is critical relative to the impact it is designed to correct.
   7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops. Usually more powerful than adjusting negative feedback loops.
   6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information). Missing feedback is a common cause of system malfuction, adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention. May stem from human tendency to avoid accountability for our own decisions.
   5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints). Understand the rules and who has power over them to understand deepest malfunctions of systems.
   4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure. Ability to change things earlier on the list, known in systems lingo as self-organization. This ability to evolve creates great resilience.
   3. The goals of the system. Important as it tends to twist everything lower to serve it.
   2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system -- its goals, structures, rules, delays, parameters -- arises. Can be very powerful, and fast at individual level, but very slow/hard at largere and societal levels.
   1. The power to transcend paradigms. If no one paradigm is right, you can choose whatever will help acheive your purpose.
* terms
  * state of the system is whatever standing stock is of importance
  * inflows increase the stock, outflows decrease it
  * parameters is how much of a discrepancy changes things and how fast.
  * buffers are large stabilizing stocks (such that changes will be more gradual). Bigger buffers can stabilize systems, but if it is too big the system becomes too slow and inflexible (and can be expensive to maintain).
* list is tentative and order is slithery, everything has exceptions. Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and what direction to push.

## Lecture

* Backcasting (aka Apollo forecasting, horizon mission methodology)
  * Starts with (usually) a preferred outcome
  * Works backwards from a realized future to describe the logical sequence of events that created that future, stated as a timeline
  * Basic steps:
    * What needs to have happened to create this future? Brainstorm a list of necessary events.
    * Review events and order by pre-cursor/successor rationale; put in draft order on a timeline.
    * Fill in blanks with missing required events, adjust order as needed.
    * Suggest potential dates and timeframes for each event on the timeline, creating a future history.
* Futurium digital futures content six dimensions: Personal life, Governance, Environment, Economy, Science & Technology, Society
* Backcasting asks:
  * What needs to happen to create that preferred outcome?
  * What are the logical precursor steps?
  * What changes would need to occur?
  * Which of the emerging changes can we amplify or build upon to create the desired future?
* Stakeholder mapping
  * Who is interested in or affected by your vision, initiative, policy, project, product, or service?
  * How much influence or power do they have over it? How enthused are they about it? (make a matrix of these from low to high)
  * Rely on support from high influence, high enthusiasm.
  * Explain benefits and increase enthusiasm for high influence, low enthusiasm.
  * Understand, manage, and communicate with lower enthusiasm and/or lower influence (though less work will be needed for high enthusiasm).
  * Opponents - watch them: high influence, low support
  * Messengers/Champions - activate them: high influence, high support
  * Not a priority - minimize engagement: low influence, low support
  * Fan Club - Inform them: low influence, high support
* Stakeholder Influence
  * Where/how do they connect to your issue, product, or policy? Are they close to the core, parter of wider profession/market/discipline, or simply part of the interested public?
  * Some dichotomies:
    * Internal/External/Public
    * Internal: Employees, Manager, Owners; External: Suppliers, Society, Government, Creditors, Shareholders, Customers
    * Customers, Suppliers, Regulators, Competitors, Investors
  * Consider creating a scoring matrix that shows for each strategy, whether it would be a win or loss for each considered stakeholder.
* Windtunnelling
  * Test robustness of objectives/policies against different scenarios
  * Explore ways to optimize future success
  * Help to identify future risks
  * Challenge 'official view' of the future
  * Create an environment for open debate on options
  * Process:
    * Develop scenarios, or work with suitable existing ones
    * Identify the objective/policy/desired outcome to be tested
    * Examine how the external conditions described in each scenario affect delivery of the desired outcome
    * Identify the implications for strategy implementations
  * Plot options across different scenarios to find where they are robust, where they need modification, and where they are redundant.
  * Consider across options which options will succeed/fail/contingent, and whether this implier something to do now/reject/monitor.
  * Can also consider options degree of impact across different scenarios (ie no impact, low impact, medium impact, high impact)
