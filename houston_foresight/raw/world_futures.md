# World Futures

## Week 2: Framework Project, Scanning Review, and Archetype Technique

### [Reading] Framework Foresight: Exploring futures the Houston Way (Hines, Bishop)

* Framework Foresight is a modular meta-method which support substitution and/or supplementation from other methods and techniques.
* Centers around baseline and alternative futures and their implications to drive plan development and stimulate action.
* It is inherently selective, focusing on quality over quantity, generally 5-10 items for each section.

* Domain Description
  * Domain Definition
  * Geographic Scope - What city, country, region, or is it global?
  * Time Horizon - How long into the future does the forecast extend? Which trends are likely to still be in play?
  * Domain Map - What parts of the domain are definitely going to be considered or not considered?
  * Key Issue(s) and/or Key Question(s) - Optional, but can be helpful.
* Current Assessment
  * Current Conditions - Key variables, quantities, and structural arrangements.
  * Stakeholders - Individuals and organizations that work in and could affect the future of the domain.
  * History - An analysis of the most recent era for the domain.
* Baseline Future
  * Trends - Quantities or changes incrementally moving in a direction over a period of time, as well as the value and rate of change (if known).
  * Constants - Quantities, structures, and stakeholders that are likely to remain unchanged through the forecast period.
  * Cycles
  * Plans
  * Projections - Baseline futures forecasts made by others.
  * Summary
* Alternative Futures
  * Means of identifying alternative futures:
    * Baseline analysis
      * State evidence for baseline, exploring inputs: trends, constants, cycles, plans, and projections.
      * Challenge each piece of evidence:
        * Identify assumptions needed to accept.
        * Challenge each assumption by considering it's opposite to bring to mind reasons it might be true.
        * Identify alternative, plausible assumptions, which have foundation, support, evidence, or reasons which might make them true.
        * Extend plausible alternative assumptions into plausible alternative futures.
    * Uncertainties
      * Consider: Events, Issues or Emerging Issues, Ideas
      * Prioritize those uncertainties with the greatest impact while also having some probability of occurring.
* Preferred Future
  * Vision Statement
* Implication Analysis - Transition from the world out there to what it means for the client in here.
  * Choose a future (baseline or an alternative)
  * Choose key categories to focus implications for the client.
  * Identify potentially significant implications or changes in each category.
  * Identify additional implications using the futures wheel.
  * Highlight most important or provocative implications.
  * Highlight issues or opportunities.
* Futures to Plans
  * Prioritizing Issues/Opportunities
    * By default, pay equal attention to all unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise (ie client already has a strategy for something).
    * Helps make the futures "real" for the client by forcing them to concretely consider likelihood, impact, and how it connects to the present.
    * Three useful prioritizing criteria for futures: How likely is it compared to others? How big of an impact would it have? How unprepared is the client for it?
  * Select Issues or Opportunities - Focus on 3-6 emerging from scenarios with higher priority.
  * Elevator Pitches - High-level outline of a response to issues/opportunities answering why, what, and how (or who). Typically in that order to answer why there is a need to respond, what the response looks like, and how it is enabled or brought to action.
* Leading Indicators - Precursor events or statistics that point toward one alternative rather than another.
* Summary - Highlight surprising information, interesting futures, or important implications most important for understanding the future of the domain. Highlights the best material (key insights or critical takeaways), balancing getting attention with conveying the essence of what was learned.
