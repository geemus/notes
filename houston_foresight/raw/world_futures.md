## Week 02: Framework Project, Scanning Review, and Archetype Technique

### [Reading] Framework Foresight: Exploring futures the Houston Way (Hines, Bishop)

* Framework Foresight is a modular meta-method which support substitution and/or supplementation from other methods and techniques.
* Centers around baseline and alternative futures and their implications to drive plan development and stimulate action.
* It is inherently selective, focusing on quality over quantity, generally 5-10 items for each section.

* [Framing] Domain Description
  * Domain Definition
  * Geographic Scope - What city, country, region, or is it global?
  * Time Horizon - How long into the future does the forecast extend? Which trends are likely to still be in play?
  * Domain Map - What parts of the domain are definitely going to be considered or not considered?
  * Key Issue(s) and/or Key Question(s) - Optional, but can be helpful.
* [Scanning] Current Assessment
  * Current Conditions - Key variables, quantities, and structural arrangements.
  * Stakeholders - Individuals and organizations that work in and could affect the future of the domain.
  * History - An analysis of the most recent era for the domain.
* [Forecasting] Baseline Future
  * Trends - Quantities or changes incrementally moving in a direction over a period of time, as well as the value and rate of change (if known).
  * Constants - Quantities, structures, and stakeholders that are likely to remain unchanged through the forecast period.
  * Cycles
  * Plans
  * Projections - Baseline futures forecasts made by others.
  * Summary
* [Forecasting] Alternative Futures
  * Means of identifying alternative futures:
    * Baseline analysis
      * State evidence for baseline, exploring inputs: trends, constants, cycles, plans, and projections.
      * Challenge each piece of evidence:
        * Identify assumptions needed to accept.
        * Challenge each assumption by considering it's opposite to bring to mind reasons it might be true.
        * Identify alternative, plausible assumptions, which have foundation, support, evidence, or reasons which might make them true.
        * Extend plausible alternative assumptions into plausible alternative futures.
    * Uncertainties
      * Consider: Events, Issues or Emerging Issues, Ideas
      * Prioritize those uncertainties with the greatest impact while also having some probability of occurring.
* [Visioning] Preferred Future
  * Vision Statement
* [Visioning] Implication Analysis - Transition from the world out there to what it means for the client in here.
  * Choose a future (baseline or an alternative)
  * Choose key categories to focus implications for the client.
  * Identify potentially significant implications or changes in each category.
  * Identify additional implications using the futures wheel.
  * Highlight most important or provocative implications.
  * Highlight issues or opportunities.
* [Planning] Futures to Plans
  * Prioritizing Issues/Opportunities
    * By default, pay equal attention to all unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise (ie client already has a strategy for something).
    * Helps make the futures "real" for the client by forcing them to concretely consider likelihood, impact, and how it connects to the present.
    * Three useful prioritizing criteria for futures: How likely is it compared to others? How big of an impact would it have? How unprepared is the client for it?
  * Select Issues or Opportunities - Focus on 3-6 emerging from scenarios with higher priority.
  * Elevator Pitches - High-level outline of a response to issues/opportunities answering why, what, and how (or who). Typically in that order to answer why there is a need to respond, what the response looks like, and how it is enabled or brought to action.
* [Acting] Leading Indicators - Precursor events or statistics that point toward one alternative rather than another.
* [Acting] Summary - Highlight surprising information, interesting futures, or important implications most important for understanding the future of the domain. Highlights the best material (key insights or critical takeaways), balancing getting attention with conveying the essence of what was learned.

### [Reading] Evolution of Framework Foresight (Hines)

* Domain Description - Time Horizon was updated to reference Three Horizons.
  * Horizon One (H1) is the baseline, often 3-5 years.
  * Horizon Two (H2) is transition zone of disruptions to the baseline, often 5-10 years.
  * Horizon Three (H3) is anything beyond H2, the realm of weak signals indicating the next new system. Most clients are not much concerned about this.
* Current Assessment
  * History is now "Recent History" to help set proper focus/attention.
  * Scanning Hits now includes indicator of horizon (from Three Horizons)
  * Adopted Diigo as an electronic library for collecting scanning hits.
  * Distinguish between scanning and research activities:
    * Scanning is searching for any signal of change.
    * Researching is searching for specific types of information about the future, called inputs, aka TIPPs: trends, issues, plans and projections.
  * Focus inputs from a much larger list down to just TIPPs.
* Drivers added as a bridge between scan hits/inputs and the futures.
* Baseline and Alternative Futures
  * Adopted Dator's four futures archetypes (Continuation, Collapse, New Equillibrium, and Transformation)
  * Outcomes of drivers are projected in each of the four archetypes to provide a robust set of scenarios to work with.
  * To determine which future to focus on, added 30-60 min workshop exercise where participants rate them on dimensions of likelihood and unpreparedness. (usually scores are similar, reinforcing value of paying attention to all futures)
* Implications Analysis - Added guidance surrounding Futures Wheel brainstorming with a step-by-step approach:
  * Choose a future (baseline or alternative)
  * Choose categories
  * Identify key changes in each category
  * Identify additional implications usuing the Futures Wheel
  * Prioritize most important and provocative implications
* Issues or Opportunities - adds an integrated strategic approach by providing four approaches (from safest to riskiest)
  * Robust strategy focused on commonalities across all options.
  * Hedge-your-bets strategy assumes all options are equally viable and divides action equally across them.
  * Core-satellite strategy mostly focuses on one option, but pays lesser attention to the rest just in case. (This seems to be the most commonly selected by clients)
  * Bet-the-farm selects one option and invests all energy toward pursuing it.

### [Reading] Shifting Consumer Values (Hines)

* Interview based on ConsumerShift: How Changing Values Are Reshaping the Consumer Landscape
* Values are those things peolpe hold as most important in life, which guide decision-making and behavior. They may also be the single best indicator of emerging consumer change.
* Distinct from virtues, which focus on timeless notions of right and wrong, and attitudes, which are more situation specific.
* Core values are those values that one has actually acted upon.
* Among systems related to values, Hines found Ron Ingnlehart's World Values Survey and Don Beck's Spiral Dynamics most useful for providing insights.
* Four core clusters of values, with individuals containing a mix, but also tending to have a particular center of gravity among them. Clusters:
  * Traditional - focus on following rules and fulfilling one's predetermined role.
  * Modern - focus on achievement, economic growth, and progress.
  * Postmodern - focus on search for meaning in one's life.
  * Integral - focus on personal growth, with understanding and sensitivity to systemic considerations.
* In good conditions, people tend to progress through these, whereas in adverse conditions they may regress.
* The biggest catalyst to changing or reprioritizing values is a change in a person's context. When this occurs values generally don't disappear, but simply become less important.
* Overall trends seem to be toward later clusters, with more of a focus on quality of quantity.
* Pay close attention to cases where people's stated values and behavior contradict. This can indicate an unmet need and/or future opportunity.
* To integrate, consider where you and/or your organization is within the clusters and where you would like to be.
* Business Implications:
  * Values change in a predictable pattern, which makes them incredibly useful for studying emerging behavior and understanding long-term trajectories.
  * Values can provide a humanizing element to research projects, which can otherwise get lost in the quick pace of technology change.
  * Clusters describe people's center of gravity, not an absolute. Values work should account for this variability.
  * Brands that enable people to express their values position themselves for loyalty and success. Considering values can help companies fine tune messaging for their customers and/or their customers' customers.

### [Reading] The Never Ending Upward Quest (Roemischer)

* Suggests that in response to adversity humans can adapt by creating greater complexities of thinking.
* No final state, just upward quest with each stage a prelude to the next.
* Each stage "trancends but includes", so more complex systems have greater degrees of freedom.
* Higher-order priorities suddenly vanish in the midst of personal tragedy, extreme suffering, or deprivation.
* No meme is better than another. Each is a response to life conditions, and each has positive and negative aspects.
* Each meme can existing within a person, to be expressed in response to life conditions.
* Boomeritis/Mean-Green-Meme - Green is enabled by orange (which is built on blue), but often will attack blue/orange without understanding implications.

* MEMES
  * Subsistence
    * Beige - Instinctive/Survivalistic - ~100,000 years ago - Do what you must to stay alive
    * Purple - Magical/Animistic - ~50,000 years ago - Keep the spirits happy and the tribe's nest warm and safe
    * Red - Impulsize/Egocentric - ~10,000 years ago - Be what you are and do what you want, regardless
    * Blue - Purposeful/Authoritarian - ~5,000 years ago - Life has meaning, direction, and purpose with predetermined outcomes
    * Orange - Achievist/Strategic - ~300 years ago - Act in your own self-interest by playing the game to win
    * Green - Communitarian/Egalitarian - ~150 years ago - Seek peace within the inner self and explore, with others, the caring dimensions of community
  * Being
    * Yellow - Integrative - ~50 years ago - Live fully and responsibly as what you are and learn to become - left brain with feelings
    * Turquoise - Holistic - ~30 years ago - Experience the wholeness of existence through mind and spirit - right brain with data

* Some background on the author and why you think they wrote the piece: Having immersed themselves in Spiral Dynamics, they wanted to share how they were making sense of their life with it, and share more about it by interviewing the creator.
* The key point or conclusion that the author is making: The author is seeking to demonstrate that Spiral Dynamics as a theory of human development provides a major breakthrough in mapping and managing the complexity of people. Each stage "transcends but includes", adding both complexity and greater degrees of freedom. The stages progress in response to challenge, but can also regress among tragedy, suffering, or deprivation.
* What are a couple of key piece of supporting evidence? How does the author support his/her conclusion? They share many examples of Don Beck, the creator of Spiral Dynamics, having success applying this. Particularly it talks in depth about his work in South Africa to tackle apartheid, including a series of articles he wrote which were influential in the release of Nelson Mandela and the start of the peace process. The author also personalizes the story by speaking about how they have used Spiral Dynamics to make sense of their own life path.
* What did you find interesting about the piece? Spiral Dynamics itself provides an interesting set of memes and a theory of their interelation that provides support in making sense of complex human interactions. It was interesting to learn about how the levels interrelate and influence one another, and how they are interdependent rather than a strict progression.
* What did you question or not agree with, if anything? I found the language around this being an unending upward quest to be in opposition to the assertion that no level is better than any other, as it seems to imply that the higher levels are more desirable. Some of the particular suggestions around different levels, such as the notion that beige individuals had remote viewing capabilities to undermine the overall credibility of things. Also, although the levels and memes themselves provide an interesting and potentially helpful framework, I found the assignment of particular colors to seem a bit arbitrary and distracting compared to using the descriptive names specifically.
