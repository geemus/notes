# World Futures

## Week 02: Framework Project, Scanning Review, and Archetype Technique

### [Reading] Framework Foresight: Exploring futures the Houston Way (Hines, Bishop)

* Framework Foresight is a modular meta-method which support substitution and/or supplementation from other methods and techniques.
* Centers around baseline and alternative futures and their implications to drive plan development and stimulate action.
* It is inherently selective, focusing on quality over quantity, generally 5-10 items for each section.

* [Framing] Domain Description
  * Domain Definition
  * Geographic Scope - What city, country, region, or is it global?
  * Time Horizon - How long into the future does the forecast extend? Which trends are likely to still be in play?
  * Domain Map - What parts of the domain are definitely going to be considered or not considered?
  * Key Issue(s) and/or Key Question(s) - Optional, but can be helpful.
* [Scanning] Current Assessment
  * Current Conditions - Key variables, quantities, and structural arrangements.
  * Stakeholders - Individuals and organizations that work in and could affect the future of the domain.
  * History - An analysis of the most recent era for the domain.
* [Forecasting] Baseline Future
  * Trends - Quantities or changes incrementally moving in a direction over a period of time, as well as the value and rate of change (if known).
  * Constants - Quantities, structures, and stakeholders that are likely to remain unchanged through the forecast period.
  * Cycles
  * Plans
  * Projections - Baseline futures forecasts made by others.
  * Summary
* [Forecasting] Alternative Futures
  * Means of identifying alternative futures:
    * Baseline analysis
      * State evidence for baseline, exploring inputs: trends, constants, cycles, plans, and projections.
      * Challenge each piece of evidence:
        * Identify assumptions needed to accept.
        * Challenge each assumption by considering it's opposite to bring to mind reasons it might be true.
        * Identify alternative, plausible assumptions, which have foundation, support, evidence, or reasons which might make them true.
        * Extend plausible alternative assumptions into plausible alternative futures.
    * Uncertainties
      * Consider: Events, Issues or Emerging Issues, Ideas
      * Prioritize those uncertainties with the greatest impact while also having some probability of occurring.
* [Visioning] Preferred Future
  * Vision Statement
* [Visioning] Implication Analysis - Transition from the world out there to what it means for the client in here.
  * Choose a future (baseline or an alternative)
  * Choose key categories to focus implications for the client.
  * Identify potentially significant implications or changes in each category.
  * Identify additional implications using the futures wheel.
  * Highlight most important or provocative implications.
  * Highlight issues or opportunities.
* [Planning] Futures to Plans
  * Prioritizing Issues/Opportunities
    * By default, pay equal attention to all unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise (ie client already has a strategy for something).
    * Helps make the futures "real" for the client by forcing them to concretely consider likelihood, impact, and how it connects to the present.
    * Three useful prioritizing criteria for futures: How likely is it compared to others? How big of an impact would it have? How unprepared is the client for it?
  * Select Issues or Opportunities - Focus on 3-6 emerging from scenarios with higher priority.
  * Elevator Pitches - High-level outline of a response to issues/opportunities answering why, what, and how (or who). Typically in that order to answer why there is a need to respond, what the response looks like, and how it is enabled or brought to action.
* [Acting] Leading Indicators - Precursor events or statistics that point toward one alternative rather than another.
* [Acting] Summary - Highlight surprising information, interesting futures, or important implications most important for understanding the future of the domain. Highlights the best material (key insights or critical takeaways), balancing getting attention with conveying the essence of what was learned.

### [Reading] Evolution of Framework Foresight (Hines)

* Domain Description - Time Horizon was updated to reference Three Horizons.
  * Horizon One (H1) is the baseline, often 3-5 years.
  * Horizon Two (H2) is transition zone of disruptions to the baseline, often 5-10 years.
  * Horizon Three (H3) is anything beyond H2, the realm of weak signals indicating the next new system. Most clients are not much concerned about this.
* Current Assessment
  * History is now "Recent History" to help set proper focus/attention.
  * Scanning Hits now includes indicator of horizon (from Three Horizons)
  * Adopted Diigo as an electronic library for collecting scanning hits.
  * Distinguish between scanning and research activities:
    * Scanning is searching for any signal of change.
    * Researching is searching for specific types of information about the future, called inputs, aka TIPPs: trends, issues, plans and projections.
  * Focus inputs from a much larger list down to just TIPPs.
* Drivers added as a bridge between scan hits/inputs and the futures.
* Baseline and Alternative Futures
  * Adopted Dator's four futures archetypes (Continuation, Collapse, New Equillibrium, and Transformation)
  * Outcomes of drivers are projected in each of the four archetypes to provide a robust set of scenarios to work with.
  * To determine which future to focus on, added 30-60 min workshop exercise where participants rate them on dimensions of likelihood and unpreparedness. (usually scores are similar, reinforcing value of paying attention to all futures)
* Implications Analysis - Added guidance surrounding Futures Wheel brainstorming with a step-by-step approach:
  * Choose a future (baseline or alternative)
  * Choose categories
  * Identify key changes in each category
  * Identify additional implications usuing the Futures Wheel
  * Prioritize most important and provocative implications
* Issues or Opportunities - adds an integrated strategic approach by providing four approaches (from safest to riskiest)
  * Robust strategy focused on commonalities across all options.
  * Hedge-your-bets strategy assumes all options are equally viable and divides action equally across them.
  * Core-satellite strategy mostly focuses on one option, but pays lesser attention to the rest just in case. (This seems to be the most commonly selected by clients)
  * Bet-the-farm selects one option and invests all energy toward pursuing it.
