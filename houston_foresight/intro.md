# FORE 6311: Introduction to Foresight

* Systemic attempts to understand possible (art), probable (science), and preferable (politics/ethics/psychology) futures.
* Thinking Modes: creative, logical, systemic, critical, intuitive-empathetic.
* Foresight Activities: identify/monitor change, map/critique impact, imagine alternatives, envision prefered futures, organize/act toward change.
* Premise: Multiple futures are possible, drivers of change can be identified/studied, and the future can be influenced.

## Theories of Change

* Ideally theories consider linear/cyclical/tracendental patterns and agency/structure/superagency(trancendental) causes of change.
* Change Theory Categories: progress, development, technology, culture, cycle, conflict, market, power, evolution, emergence
* Change Archetypes: Growth, Collapse, Discipline (things level out with careful coordination), Transformation

## Images of Futures

* No future facts, many future images.
* Look at what images indicate what will remain constant and what will change. What is being promised? How different would it be?
* Infrastructure projects force some consideration of the future.
* Tools for analysis:
  * Schemas: optimistic/pessimistic, deterministic/free-will
  * Criteria: credibility/plausibility, reproducibility, value/impact, explicitness
  * Kinds: possible, probable, plausible/credible, preferable
  * Archetypes: continued growth, environmental sustainability, ideological exclusionism, high tech transformation, spiritual transcendence
  * Frameworks:
    * IFTF Meta-analytics spider chart: Logic, Complex/Nuanced, Evocative, Provocative, Stimulating
    * Verge spider chart - degrees of change: Define, Related, Connect, Create, Consume, Destroy
    * STEEP spider chart - degrees of change: Society, Technology, Economy, Environment, Politics

## Scanning for Change

* Environmental scanning learns about external forces so responses can be developed.
* Planning is the navigational map, scanning is radar to supplement fast enough to create and manage contingencies.
* Effective environment scanning balances control/creativity, centralization/decentralization, and focus/exploration.
* Modes: touring/undirected viewing, tracking/conditioned viewing, satisficing/informal search, retrieving/formal search
* Considerations When Scanning:
  * How credible is the source?
  * First mention or confirmation/contradiction?
  * Objectively or only subjectively true (new to me vs new to a leading thinker)?
  * What is the time horizon for "emergence" (public awareness/market saturation)?
* Analysis: potential impacts, relevant impacts, kind of change, triggers/dependencies, indicators, impact area

## Three Horizons

* axes are time (x-axis) and fit (degree of acceptance in society) with external environment, from low to high (y-axis)
* time horizon varies based on subject/domain under scrutiny
* Horizons:
  * 1st Horizon - status quo, losing "fit" over time as environment changes
  * 2nd Horizon - intermediate, generally unstable transitional space between 1st/3rd, characterized by clashes of values.
  * 3rd Horizon - marginal ideas/arguments about the future, which may displace status quo if they better address environmental change
* To challenge/replace horizon 1, horizon 3 needs to show it can work at the required scale and win the battle of values (against both horizon 1 and other viable horizon 3 alternatives)
* Conventional scenarios critique: 1. insufficiently critique underlying values/assumptions 2. emphasis on 'important' drivers overlooks weak/emerging signals 3. may discourage individuals from believing their actions can make a difference

## Timelines

* Integrating quantitative time-oriented info into a unified presentation can reveal patterns, causes, probabilities, and possibilities.
* Cycles, waves, logistics curves, and other archetypical patterns overald can provide deeper understanding of dynamics.
* Common patterns of change: linear, exponential, asymptotic, growth/collapse, s-curve, cycle/wave, and chaotic transition.
* Constructing timelines:
  1. Plot events and time series data on the timeline
  2. Plot archetypal patterns of change
  3. Identify, investigate potential significant relationships/anomalies
  4. Extrapolate identified patterns and relationships
  5. Create exploratory forecasts.
  6. Identify tracking indicators.
  7. Analyze and assess validity of exploratory forecasts.

## Systems Thinking

* Analysis breaks things down repeatedly to build knowledge. Synthesis looks repeatedly at what system something is a part of to build understanding.
* Systems have a purpose. All parts must be present to carry out the purpose. The arrangement of the parts affects performance. System stability is sought through feedback.
* System: any group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent parts that form a complex and unified whole that has a specific purpose. (without interdependencies, we just have a collection of parts)
* Systems analysis seeks to understand how current outcomes are reached, to better inform how to drive different and better outcomes.
* Causal Loop Components:
  * Reinforcing Processes: positive feedback, where change leads to more change in the same direction
  * Balancing Processes: negative feedback, seek to keep a system at some desired level of performance, generally to stabilize or goal seek.
  * Delays, come in 4 types:
    * Physical: time taken for "stuff" to move from one place to another or change from one state to another
    * Transactional: time it takes for things to complete
    * Informational: time it takes to communicate about physical changes or decisions
    * Perceptual: time it takes for beliefs/assumptions to catch up with everything else
* Alternative to Causal Loop is Stock and Flow, which unlike causal loop can give information about rate of change.
  * Stocks/accumulators are anything that accumulates and can be measured, Flows/rates are thing that change over time.
* Levels of perspective, from lowest to highest future leverage (and consequently, highest to lowest present impact)
  * Events - Reactive - respond to events as they occur
  * Patterns - Adaptive - adapt processes to make best use of the current system
  * Systemic Structures - Creative - creating or redesigning systems to change events and patterns
  * Mental Models - Reflective - surface, suspend, and question assumptions about how the world works and what is important (invite others to do the same)
  * Vision - Generative - bring something into being that did not exist (can provide impetus to push through discomfort/difficulty of changing mental models)
* Process:
  * What interests you? Who are the actors? How are they changing? What is the environment? How is it changing?
  * Identify key nouns. Which are variables? Can any be clustered or excluded?
  * Create initial influence map by choosing important variables and drawing arrows to show ingoing/outgoing influence.
    * CATWOE can be helpful for ideas: Customers, Actors, Transformations, Worldviews/values, Owners, and Environment
    * STEEP can also be helpful for ideas: Society, Technology, Economy, Environment, Politics

## Forecasting

* "uncertainty illusion" rightly percieves future an uncertain, yet imagines the past is less so due to hindsight bias.
* Research shows using a skill repeatedly without clear, prompt, accurate feedback leads to the dangerous combination of growing confidence without growing skill.
* Writing down a precise numeric forecast and why you believe it (ideally with an explanation as to why) provides practice and fights back against the uncertainty illusion/hindsight bias.
* Forecasting tournaments provide a concrete and explicit means of practicing forecasting and getting feedback.

* Foresight tracks change toward two purposes: to map it and to influence it.
* Baseline forecasts extrapolate present conditions and trends into the future, also known as expected or surprise-free forecasts. It isn't really that likely, but it provides a good basis for discussion.
* Alternative forecasts are what happens when the baseline does not. Each is likely to be individually less probable than the baseline, but in aggregate they are more probable than the baseline.
* Forecasts taken together are represented as a cone, where as more time elapses the baseline becomes increasingly less probably and the size of the cone grows to map to this increasing uncertainty.
* Forecasts often help us understand the dynamics of change, even if they do not predict exactly what will happen or could happen.

* Baseline analysis - rigourously arrive at alternative futures based on evidence and plausible reasons
  * Conduct research
  * Forecast baseline (expected) future
  * State evidence for baseline, such as constants, trends, plans
  * Challenge evidence:
    * Is it true? (ie no-one has a plausable reason to object to its truth)
    * Is it relevant? Does it support the inference?
    * Is it sufficient? Is the evidence strong enough to support the strength of the claim?
  * Identify assumptions that one must accept to use each piece of evidence which passed the challenge.
  * Challenge each assumption by stating its opposite, bringing to mind reasons the assumption might be true.
  * Identify plausible alternative assumptions.
  * Use alternative assumptions and reasoning as a foundation and extend plausible alternative futures.
* Evaluating support for an inference:
  * Identify an important conclusion of the piece
  * Identify the evidence in the piece that supports the conclusion
  * Identify the assumptions required to use each piece of evidence
  * Reverse each assumption to create alternatives
  * Consider reasons that each alternative might be true
  * If there are such reasons, identify the modifications to the original conclusion or an entirely new conclusion that result if the alternative assumption is true
  * Make a judgement concerning the original conclusion and any other plausible conclusions that result

* Six Rules for Effective Forecasting (Saffo)
  * Define a Cone of Uncertainty - forecasting provides context to inform intuition.
  * Look for the S Curve - most important developments follow the S-curve shape of a power law, with change sarting slowly and incrementally, exploding, and eventually tapering off or even dropping back down.
  * Embrace Things that Don't Fit - the best way to spot an emerging S-curve is to identify the things that don't fit, as anything truly new won't fit into existing categories.
  * Hold Strong Opinions Weakly - lots of interlocking weak information is more trustworthy than a point or two of strong information.
  * Look Back Twice as Far as You Look Forward - "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes", by looking back at least twice as far we can look for patterns
  * Know When Not to Make a Forecast - even in times of dramatic change, there are vastly more elements that do not change than new things that emerge. If the uncertainty is too great, and therefore the cone too wide, it may be a better time to wait for things to settle than to forecast.

* 6 types of Socratic Questions:
  * Clarifying Thinking & Understanding: Can you give me an example? Could you explain further? Are you saying...? What is the problem you are trying to solve?
  * Challenging Assumptions: Is that always the case? Are you assuming...? How could you verify or disprove that? What would happen if...?
  * Examining Evidence & Rationale: Why do you say that? How do you know? Why? What evidence is there that supports...?
  * Considering Alternative Perspectives: Are there any alternatives? What is the other side of the argument? What makes your viewpoint better? Who would be affected and what would they think?
  * Considering Implications & Consequences: What are the implications/consequences of...? How does that affect...? What if you are wrong? What does our experience tell us will happen?
  * Meta Questions: Why do you think I asked that question? What does ... mean? What is the point of the question? What else might I ask?

# Critiquing Impacts of Change

* Causal layered analysis
  * CLA orients toward action learning and integrated methodologies. Answers are not right or wrong, rather dialogue is used to recognize multiple ways of knowing between different levels. The interaction between the levels and ways of knowing is key to understanding different possibilities.
  * Work down through levels and then back up as needed:
    * 1 - Litany - Quantitative trends, problems (often exaggerated, often used for political purposes). Events, issues and trends are not connected and appear discontinuous. Results in feelings of helplessness, apathy, or projected action. Believed, rarely questioned.
    * 2 - Social - Social causes, including economic, cultural, political and historical factors. Intepretation is given to quantitative data. Data is questioned, but not the paradigm in which the issue is framed.
    * 3 - Discourse/Worldview - Structure and the discource/worldview that supports and legitimizes it. Seeks to find deeper secial, linguistic, and cultural structures that are actor-invariant. Discerns deeper assumptions. Foundation for how the litany has been presented and variables used to understand the litany are questioned.
    * 4 - Myth/Metaphor - Unconcious assumptions of how the world is or should be.

* Futures Wheels
  * Structured brainstorming, method of identifying and packaging secondary and tertiary consequences of trends and events
  * Futures wheel generates input to futures thinking, and should be used as a basis for further thinking, more systematic exploration, and application of other techniques for probing the future.
  * Trend or event is written in center of paper, with spokes to primary impacts or consequences, then further spokes to secondary consequences and so-on until a useful picture of implications is clear.
  * be specific, be vivid, be provocative
  * Version 2 adds a requirement that impacts be considered for a predetermined set of areas to try and force more diverse ideas (ie STEEP)
  * Version 3 adds separate wheels for historic forces, current impacts, and future consequences (possibly with a different team for each time period).

* VERGE Framework - focuses on the area of impact, as opposed to STEEP which focuses on the origin of impact
  * Define - the concepts, ideas, and paradigms we use to define the world around us
  * Connect - the technologies used to connect people, places and things
  * Consume - the ways in which we acquire and use the goods and services we create
  * Relate - social structures and relationships which link people and organizations
  * Create - the processes and technology throug which we create goods and services
  * Destroy - the ways in which we destroy value and the reasons for doing so

# Exploring Alternative Futures

* Four Futures:
  * Archetypes: continuation, collapse, discipline, transformation
  * Framing: ideally have four separate rooms, one for each future. Decorated to depict that future, with artifacts/decorations/actors (or at least a written description).
* 2x2 'Double Uncertainty' Method
  * Critical issue: what decision keeps you awake at night?
  * Local operating environment: what key factors will determine the success or failure of the critical issue?
  * Macro environment: what are some of the driving forces creating change in the wider world?
  * Rank those driving forces by importance and uncertainty: MOST important and MOST uncertain
  * Select the scenario logics and create the scenario matrix
  * Flesh out the scenarios by referring to the key factors, and suggest plausible events that might create that end state
  * Implication: how does the decision look in each scenario? -- Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats (SWOT) analysis
  * What might usefully serve as leading indicators or signposts that you are heading toward one or another of these scenarios?
* Causal Layered Analysis:
  * designed to explore perspectives (empirical, critical, interpretative) across each layer, with none privileged/silenced, and no winners/losers
  * metaphor isn't necessary for scenarios, but it helps
  * litany created humour, metaphor makes new connections
  * resilient to process issues, thoughtful, open, and searching conversation
* Manoa - mimicking genius forecasting
  * identify three or more disparate, orthogonal emerging changes, ie, from three different STEEP categories
  * take each and imagine it's impacts
  * chase impact chains
  * ID cross impacts
  * ID interconnections that form amplifying / accelerating loops
  * ID backlashes and contradictions that create balancing / slowing loops & conflict
* Tools:
  * Impacts of Change: Three Horizons (Timelines), Gartner Hype Cycle (Timelines), Verge Futures Framework, Futures wheels, Cross-impact matrix, Influence/systems mapping
  * Awareness of Change: Horizon Scanning, Emerging Issues Analysis, Datamining, Trendspotting, Wild Cards
  * Alternative Futures: Incasting/Scenario Archetypes, Causal Layered Analysis, 2x2 Scenario Building, Morphological Analysis, Inductive Scenarios, Manoa Scenario Building, Design Futures (Thing)
  * Preferred Futures: Causal Layered Analysis, Appreciative Inquiry, Future Search, Seeds of Good Anthropocenes
  * Strategy and Change Management: Backcasting, Early Warning Indicators, Roadmapping, Influence Mapping

# Designing Experiential Futures

* Goal is "diagetic integrity", that the scenario holds together on it's own terms: no gaps in logic, no clumsy flashing arrows.
* Experiential futures seek to bring material and emotional reality to scenarios so that they will be more impactful.
* Experiential futures ladder (from abstract/general to concrete/specific)
  * Setting - kind of future, top level descriptor
  * Scenario - specific future history or state
  * Situation - 1:1 scale, visitable respresentation of time and place
  * Stuff - artifact or instantiation

# Values and Preferred Futures

* Five Key Activities of Integrated Foresight
  * Identify & Monitor Change - Identify patterns of change: trends in chosen variables, changes in cycles, and emerging issues of change.
  * Critique Change - Examine primary, secondary, tertiary impacts; inequities in impacts; differntial access, etc.
  * Imagine the Possible - Identify, analyze, and build alternative images of the future, or 'scenarios'.
  * Envision the Preferred - Identify, analyze, and articulate images of preferred futures, or 'visions'.
  * Plan & Implement - Identify stakeholders, resources; clarify goals; design strategies; organize action; create change.
* Futures Studies seek to act to enhance the probability of our preferable futures. Effective visions inspire action.
* Techniques
  * meditative visualization - share worst fears, convert to best hopes, share/discuss, backcast
  * critique/fantasy/implement - prepare rules of play, catharsis, fantasize visionary solution, implement by accetping constraints, commit
  * appreciative inquiry - frame intervention, discover what is good/working, design what could be or would be ideal, how to make it happen (destiny)
  * past, present, ideal future - ACT - shared history timeline, external trends and current/possible future responses, prouds/sorries, ideal future, identify/confirm common ground, commit with deadline
  * CLA
  * VERGE - How should we ...? on all 6 dimensions
  * 3 Horizons
  * Manoa for Visioning

# Imagination to Action

* Backcasting (aka Apollo forecasting or horizon mission methodology)
  * start with an outcome (usually the preferred one) and work backwards to build up a timeline to reach this outcome
* Stakeholder mapping seeks to understand who is interested and will be impacted, how they might react, and how this may influence action plans.
* Windtunnelling tests robustness of objectives/scenarios across different scenarios to provide feedback and input for refinement.

# Future of Futures

* Futures is moving toward: crowdsourced, integral, design/experiential, anticipation as discipline, complexity and emergence
