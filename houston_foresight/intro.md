# FORE 6311: Introduction to Foresight

* Systemic attempts to understand possible (art), probable (science), and preferable (politics/ethics/psychology) futures.
* Thinking Modes: creative, logical, systemic, critical, intuitive-empathetic.
* Foresight Activities: identify/monitor change, map/critique impact, imagine alternatives, envision prefered futures, organize/act toward change.
* Premise: Multiple futures are possible, drivers of change can be identified/studied, and the future can be influenced.

## Theories of Change

* Ideally theories consider linear/cyclical/tracendental patterns and agency/structure/superagency(trancendental) causes of change.
* Change Theory Categories: progress, development, technology, culture, cycle, conflict, market, power, evolution, emergence
* Change Archetypes: Growth, Collapse, Discipline (things level out with careful coordination), Transformation

## Images of Futures

* No future facts, many future images.
* Look at what images indicate what will remain constant and what will change. What is being promised? How different would it be?
* Infrastructure projects force some consideration of the future.
* Tools for analysis:
  * Schemas: optimistic/pessimistic, deterministic/free-will
  * Criteria: credibility/plausibility, reproducibility, value/impact, explicitness
  * Kinds: possible, probable, plausible/credible, preferable
  * Archetypes: continued growth, environmental sustainability, ideological exclusionism, high tech transformation, spiritual transcendence
  * Frameworks:
    * IFTF Meta-analytics spider chart: Logic, Complex/Nuanced, Evocative, Provocative, Stimulating
    * Verge spider chart - degrees of change: Define, Related, Connect, Create, Consume, Destroy
    * STEEP spider chart - degrees of change: Society, Technology, Economy, Environment, Politics

## Scanning for Change

* Environmental scanning learns about external forces so responses can be developed.
* Planning is the navigational map, scanning is radar to supplement fast enough to create and manage contingencies.
* Effective environment scanning balances control/creativity, centralization/decentralization, and focus/exploration.
* Modes: touring/undirected viewing, tracking/conditioned viewing, satisficing/informal search, retrieving/formal search
* Considerations When Scanning:
  * How credible is the source?
  * First mention or confirmation/contradiction?
  * Objectively or only subjectively true (new to me vs new to a leading thinker)?
  * What is the time horizon for "emergence" (public awareness/market saturation)?
* Analysis: potential impacts, relevant impacts, kind of change, triggers/dependencies, indicators, impact area

## Three Horizons

* axes are time (x-axis) and fit (degree of acceptance in society) with external environment, from low to high (y-axis)
* time horizon varies based on subject/domain under scrutiny
* Horizons:
  * 1st Horizon - status quo, losing "fit" over time as environment changes
  * 2nd Horizon - intermediate, generally unstable transitional space between 1st/3rd, characterized by clashes of values.
  * 3rd Horizon - marginal ideas/arguments about the future, which may displace status quo if they better address environmental change
* To challenge/replace horizon 1, horizon 3 needs to show it can work at the required scale and win the battle of values (against both horizon 1 and other viable horizon 3 alternatives)
* Conventional scenarios critique: 1. insufficiently critique underlying values/assumptions 2. emphasis on 'important' drivers overlooks weak/emerging signals 3. may discourage individuals from believing their actions can make a difference

## Timelines

* Integrating quantitative time-oriented info into a unified presentation can reveal patterns, causes, probabilities, and possibilities.
* Cycles, waves, logistics curves, and other archetypical patterns overald can provide deeper understanding of dynamics.
* Common patterns of change: linear, exponential, asymptotic, growth/collapse, s-curve, cycle/wave, and chaotic transition.
* Constructing timelines:
  1. Plot events and time series data on the timeline
  2. Plot archetypal patterns of change
  3. Identify, investigate potential significant relationships/anomalies
  4. Extrapolate identified patterns and relationships
  5. Create exploratory forecasts.
  6. Identify tracking indicators.
  7. Analyze and assess validity of exploratory forecasts.

## Systems Thinking

* Analysis breaks things down repeatedly to build knowledge. Synthesis looks repeatedly at what system something is a part of to build understanding.
* Systems have a purpose. All parts must be present to carry out the purpose. The arrangement of the parts affects performance. System stability is sought through feedback.
* System: any group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent parts that form a complex and unified whole that has a specific purpose. (without interdependencies, we just have a collection of parts)
* Systems analysis seeks to understand how current outcomes are reached, to better inform how to drive different and better outcomes.
* Causal Loop Components:
  * Reinforcing Processes: positive feedback, where change leads to more change in the same direction
  * Balancing Processes: negative feedback, seek to keep a system at some desired level of performance, generally to stabilize or goal seek.
  * Delays, come in 4 types:
    * Physical: time taken for "stuff" to move from one place to another or change from one state to another
    * Transactional: time it takes for things to complete
    * Informational: time it takes to communicate about physical changes or decisions
    * Perceptual: time it takes for beliefs/assumptions to catch up with everything else
* Alternative to Causal Loop is Stock and Flow, which unlike causal loop can give information about rate of change.
  * Stocks/accumulators are anything that accumulates and can be measured, Flows/rates are thing that change over time.
* Levels of perspective, from lowest to highest future leverage (and consequently, highest to lowest present impact)
  * Events - Reactive - respond to events as they occur
  * Patterns - Adaptive - adapt processes to make best use of the current system
  * Systemic Structures - Creative - creating or redesigning systems to change events and patterns
  * Mental Models - Reflective - surface, suspend, and question assumptions about how the world works and what is important (invite others to do the same)
  * Vision - Generative - bring something into being that did not exist (can provide impetus to push through discomfort/difficulty of changing mental models)
* Process:
  * What interests you? Who are the actors? How are they changing? What is the environment? How is it changing?
  * Identify key nouns. Which are variables? Can any be clustered or excluded?
  * Create initial influence map by choosing important variables and drawing arrows to show ingoing/outgoing influence.
    * CATWOE can be helpful for ideas: Customers, Actors, Transformations, Worldviews/values, Owners, and Environment
    * STEEP can also be helpful for ideas: Society, Technology, Economy, Environment, Politics
