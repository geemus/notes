# The Meaning of Employee Engagement

- Distinguishes between psychological state engagement, behavioral engagement, and trait engagement.
- In folk usage "engagement" is used in a manner implying the opposite of dis-engagement.
- Research has evolved toward increasing emphasis on absorption, passion, and affect and a lessening emphasis on satisfaction and perhaps also job involvement and organizational commitment.
- Engagement connotes activation, whereas satisfaction connotes satiation.
- Holland and Spain have designed and validated a state engagement measure.
- State engagement is considered to be relatively durable over time.
- It is common to define employee engagement as putting forth "extra" or "discretionary" effort. There are at least four challenges to this:
  - effort is not easily defined, and there is little evidence of construct validity of corresponding measures
  - extra effort is an overly limiting view of engagement if it simply connotes doing more of the same; what may be most important is doing something different
  - "extra" or "atypical" implies a reference or standard that is generally left unspecified
  - discretion itself is a complex issue, leading to ambiguous boundary conditions on the meaning of engagement
- Althought the task is central, the degree to which the person can implement his or her preferred self in the work is key, and certain characteristics of task like autonomy, challenge, and variety seem to have the main effect.
- When the goals of the organization (or leader) and the goals of the individual are entirely consistent, it follows that the level of employee state engagement will be higher and that a variety of adaptive behaviors are likely to be displayed.
- Engagement has a cost to the employee, in the form of risk. Psychological safety, fairness and other antecedents of trust may be critical.
- At least to some degree, there is a limit of the pool of energy and resources available to employees for state engagement on the one hand and behavioral engagement on the other hand; sustained levels of engagement will be difficult to achieve.
- Dispositional (trait) engagement is a more significant determinant of behavioral and psychological engagement earlier rather than later inthe employment lifecycle.
- Engagement my be a consequence of both environmental conditions, dispositional characteristics, and their interaction. Not all investments in job design, training and performance management with the goal of improving engagement will be productive for all employees.
- Any measure that asks how satisfied an employee is with conditions at work or asks about the presence of particular conditions is not a measure of any of the three facets of engagement elucidated here.
- Having engaged employees may be a key competitive advantage. It's easy to change price and product, but difficult to creat a state and behaviorally engaged workforce.

- State engagement is characterized by feelings of passion, energy, enthusiasm, and activation.
- Behavioral engagement follows from state engagement and is most broadly defined as adaptive behaviors that are typically not prescribed and that go beyond preserving the status quo and instead focus on initiating or fostering change in the sense of doing more and/or something different.
- Trait engagement comprises a number of interrelated personality attributes, including trait positive affectivity, concientiousness, the proactive personality, and the autotelic personality. These all suggest inclination to experience work in positive, active, and energic ways and to behave adaptively. In these senses, trait engagement would be a significant cause and directly relate to state engagement and indirectly to behavioral engagement.

- Job design directly effects state engagement.
- The presence of a transformational leader would directly affect state engagement
- The presence of a transformational leader would directly affect trust levels, and thus, indirectly affect behavioral engagement.

## Propositions

1. Satisfaction when assessed as satiation is not in the same conceptual space as engagement. Satisfaction when assessed as feelings of energy, enthusiasm, and similarly positive affective states becomes a facet of engagement.
2. Organizational commitment is an important facet of the state of engagement when it is conceptualized as positive attachment to the larger organizational entity and meausered as a willingness to exert energy in support of the organization, to feel pridae as an organizational member, and to have personal identification with the organization.
3. Job involvement (including task engagement and job commitment) as traditionally conceptualized and assessed is an important facet of the psychological state of engagement.
4. Feelings of empowerment that connote an inclination to action vis-a-vis work (feelings of self-efficacy and control and impact from one's action) compromise another facet of state engagement.
5. Positive affectivity (PA) associated with the job and the work setting connoting or explicitly indicating feelings of persistence, vigor, energy, dedication, absorption, enthusiasm, alertness, and pride occupies a central position in the conceptualization and measurement of state engagement. Conversely, measures of psychological states that are devoid of direct and explicit indicants of affective and energic feelings are not measures of state engagement in whole or part.
6. State engagement additionally refers to the investment of the self in the person's work and the perceived importance of work outcomes and organizational membership to that person's identity.
7. Engagement behaviors include innovative behaviors, demonstrations of initiative, proactively seeking opportunities to contribute, and going beyond what is, within specific frames of reference, typically expected or required.
8. Engagement behavior includes actions that, given a specific frame of reference, go beyond what is typical, usual, ordinary, and/or ordinarily expected.
9. Role expansion, behavior that reveals attention to a wider range of tasks than is typical or usual, is a facet of engagement behavior.
10. Behavioral engagement is adaptive behavior intended to serve an organizational purpose, whether to defend and protect the status quo in response to actual or anticipated threats or to change and/or promote change in response to actual or anticipated events.
11. Trait engagement comprises a number of interrelated facets, including trait positive affectivity, conscientiousness, the proactive personality, and the autotelic personality. These all suggest the tendency to experience work in positive, active, and energic ways and to behave adaptively (ie displaying effort by going beyond what is necessary and initiating change to facilitate organizationally relevant outcomes).
12. State and behavioral engagement are more likely under some conditions than others with the nature of the work people do and the leadership under which they work central to their choosing to be attitudinally and behaviorally engaged.
13. Feelings of trust mediate the relationship between leadership behavior and behavioral engagement such that feelings of trust is the psychological state between leader behavior and behavioral engagement. Thus, leaders create trust in followers, and it is the trust followers experience that enables behavioral engagement.
14. Trait engagement interacts with work and organizational conditions to produce state and behavioral engagement. Alternatively, work conditions not only have a main effect on state and behavioral engagement, but they also may moderate the relationships between trait engagement and state engagement as well as relationships between state and behavioral engagement.
