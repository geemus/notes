# Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System

In increasing order of effectiveness:

12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards)
11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows
10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures)
09. The length of delays, relate to the rate of system change
08. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against
07. The gain around driving positive feedback loops
06. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)
05. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints)
04. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure
03. The goals of the system
02. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system--its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters--arises
01. The power to transcend paradigms
