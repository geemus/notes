# Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System

In decreasing order of effectiveness:

01. The power to transcend paradigms
02. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system--its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters--arises
03. The goals of the system
04. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure
05. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints)
06. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)
07. The gain around driving positive feedback loops
08. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against
09. The length of delays, relative to the rate of system change
10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures)
11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows
12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards)
