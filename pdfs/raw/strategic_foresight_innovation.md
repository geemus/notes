Playbook for Strategic Foresight and Innovation

## Five Planning Phases

Five Planning Phases give a POSTV path to the future.

* __Perspective__ - Understand what has come before, focus on long-term strategy, 3-5 R&D cycles out.
* __Opportunity__ - Find growth opportunities today and into the future.
* __Solution__ - Define path to innovation, prototype and understand what must be built.
* __Team__ - Find partners and teams members to coordinate and support execution.
* __Vision__ - Develop vision to guide team action toward success.

## Ambiguity Curve

Planning phases may vary from one another, but all are defined by diminishing ambiguity over time.

## Guiding Principles

* What you foresee is what you get. If you can not envision success, you probably won't find it.
* You can't put off tomorrow. Future takes time to build.

# Tools

## Perspective

Provide broad frame of reference, review past to better anticipate future.

* __Context Maps__ - identify main dimensions of problem or opportunity space
* __Progression Curves__ - contextualize event timelines, industry lifecycles, and other developments
* __Janus Cones__ - view multiple, overlapping, and intersecting events in a single framework

## Opportunity

Understand future customer changes to see growth opportunities now and in the future.

* __Generational Arcs__ - view demographic changes and generational views of target population
* __Future User__ - profile future customer based on what will (and will not) change from today's customer
* __Futuretelling__ - use live theater to illustrate a particular user need as a realistic scene from the future

## Solution

Define questions that exist along different possible paths.

* __White Spots__ - find hidden markets and take a broad look at competitor landscape
* __Paper Mockups__ - create tangible models of ideas which can be tested at low cost for high value
* __Change Paths__ - plot major milestones needed on path to action

* __Dark Horse Prototypes__ - test out a particular option

## Team

Find talent and leadership needed for new innovation.

* __Buddy Checks__ - find matches for partners and teammates
* __VOICE Stars__ - identify aptitudes for radical innovation leadership
* __Crowd Clovers__ - map innovation networks

## Vision

Sharpen team vision to guide action.

* __Vision Statement__ - provide clear and concise summary
* __DARPA Hard Test__ - measure visionary potential of radical innovation
* __Pathfinders__ - determine best path through organization or network

#  How to Start

Types of growth through innovation:

* __core growth__ - create and deliver things that fit into existing portfolio, generally focused on short-term opportunities
* __new growth__ - add new operations or find new markets that complement existing efforts, generally mid-term opportunities
* __emerging growth__ - capitalize on emerging areas and big bets in new or unrelated sectors, generally long term

Places to look for inspiration:

* __organizational start__ - internal R&D or strategy teams
* __internal start__ - promising topic area from an innovator or team leader
* __external start__ - start from scratch, look at statistics, future scenarios, history, and common niches.

Who leads innovation:

* __Pioneer__ - Trust what you can see and follow your gut through trial and error. Scan examples, and see DARPA Hard Test.
* __Problem Solver__ - Identifies assumptions, constraints, and alternatives. See Chapter 3 on Perspective and Change Paths.
* __Analyst__ - Believe effective innovation takes discipline, and appreciate systematic rigor. Learn about layering foresight methods, and see White Spots.
* __Producer__ - Rally others to a shared mindset. See Chapter 4 on Opportunity and Futuretelling.
* __Rebel__ - Routines are negotiable, look outside the box by knowing system close enough to know where to bend rules. See Chapter 7 on Vision and Extend the Future User.
* __Pragmatist__ - Take most effecient path and help others get essentials done without extra work. Skim tips and work with templates.

# Perspective

Develop historical perspective about an area of interest relevant to the future you want to create. By understanding the past you can better understand what may happen again and why.

Questions that drive this phase:

* What is the bigger context for the topic we are interested in?
* What historical events, industry actions, and societal movements can be identified as drivers?
* When reviewing previous inventions and opportunities, what similarities in timing and adoption exist today?

## Context Maps

Capture themes that emerge when discussing complex problems. Identify eight core dimensions in order to focus further work.

Instructions:

1. Agree on a broad topic or opportunity area your team wants to pursue. You set the scale of the topic. Very broad topics may require several iterations.
2. Draw an outline for a Context Map or use a template. (looks like a big flower with eight petals and the topic/opportunity in the center)
3. Strat talking with your team about your topic, noting any salient dimensions as they arise. Points of intense discussion or even disagreement are good to include in your context map.
4. Note side topics and connections around your Context Map. At times, you may jump to creata a tangential or different Context Map. That is great association.
5. Repeat the process until your team arrives at a map (or set of maps) that captures your problem space satisfactorily.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Which dimension did you spend the most time discussing?
  * Which dimension generate the greatest number of questions?
  * Which dimension generated the greated number of questions that you can't answer today?
  * After discussing as a group, do you want to redraw the map based on what you have learned?

## Progression Curves

Represent the evolution of changes in terms of technological, social, and other filters. By identifying repeating patterns, you know what to expect in the future. Layering data helps identify patterns that may have been missed previously.

Instructions:

1. Identify your starting topic. Your team could describe past developments for your idea, company, industry, society, technology area, etc. Some teams refer to their last Context Map, developing a Progression Curve per dimension.
2. Draw a long s-curve. You can always extend this curve or link other curves to it later. The height or length of the curve are largely symbolic.
3. Begin pletting key events that have influenced or changed in that space, estimating dates when necessary. The farthest left end point on the curve is set by you, going as far back in time as you wish. The farthes right end point represents today because you are not looking to project the future.
4. Add more data points along the curve. You may mix a variety of data points, such as historical dates, major events, people, company milestones, and social movements.
5. Draw more curves that intersect, extend, and even overlap with your first curve.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Which dimensions did you begin with? Why?
  * Who can you contact to verify timelines and fill in any gaps?
  * Are you surprised by how long (or quickly) progress takes?
  * Was it easier to add examples and activites your team was personally involved in? Why?

## Janus Cones

Looks backwards and forwards in time to identify the timing of historical events and how timing affects potential future events. Lets you release strict linear assumptions of events, allowing multiple, overlapping, and intersecting events in a single shared framework. Each vertical marker denotes a specific time period, such as 5 or 10 years, going incrementally backwards or forwards.

Instructions:

1. Draw an open cone facing left toward the past. The right point represents today.
2. Talke about what has happened or changed leading up to today's views and assumptions for your topic. Identify major points in time, such as a company founding. Plot these data points inside the cone, placing earlier ones further back in time than more recent points.
3. Now draw appropriate time markers under the cone, such as "1990s" or "2000" to help you cluster and organize data points by time period.
4. Draw corresponding time arcs to those dates, these arcs will be vertical.
5. Add more data points so that you complete your team team's knowledge and fill in all time periods as much as possible.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * How far back in time do your Janus Cones go? Why to that point in time?
  * If you overlaid your Progression Curves on the Janus Cones timeline, did anything surprise you?
  * Did you try adding events that changed society's attitudes (such as the British Invasion) or had long-term effects (such as the dot-com bubble)?
  * Who can you contact to fill in gaps in your map?

You should look back at least twice as far as you want to look ahead. Similarly, you are strongly advised to fill in the past side of the cones first.

# Opportunity

See growth opportunities that exist today and could extend into the future. Critical because today's opportunities become tomorrow's innovations. Moves from a focus on the past to a focus on the future, and a focus on the problem to a focus on the people. Understand the people from macro, micro, and narrative views. By understanding users better, you increase the chances your opportunity will truly meet their needs.

Questions that drive this phase:

* Which behaviours are emerging that will shape or influence new opportunities in the future?
* Which major changes about people over time, such as population movements and generational shifts, can we identify and understand that affect future changes?
* What might we expect from future users and customers?

## Generational Arcs

Identifies and tracks population changes in terms of life stages and other generational variables. Work to identify who your future users are today and who they will become in the future.

Instructions:

1. Select a country, region, or particular group as your population to study.
2. Find a credible source for your group's population records, such as the World Bank, U.S. Census Bureau, or Eurostat. See appendix for list of data sources.
3. Plot the number of people living at each age (or age range) from birth to 100 years old. Population numbers will be on the y-axis, and age ranges will be along the x-axis.
4. Note the dominant generational groups living under the population curve.
5. Describe each generation's dominant beliefs, values, and attitudes.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Looking at your potential market, is the overall trend growing, shrinking, or spiky?
  * If your chosen market has a demographic dividend, what are the implications?
  * If your chosen market is becoming a gerontocracy, what are the implications?
  * Looking at the generational changes, which one factor or aspect would you target in each generation in 10 years? 20 years? 30 years?

## Future User

Creates a future profile of a user within a targeted demographic by comparing similar groups over time. Develop multiple profiles over time for two different targets, compare over time and at similar points.

Instructions:

1. Draw a box that represents your primary customer today. Name your customer and note his/her age today. You may find it helpful to develop a detailed profile (persona) using data from interviews, generational studies, surveys, market reports, etc.
2. Draw a second box to show this person back in time and use an arrow to connect the two boxes. Not the customer's starting age. (How far you look back will depend on your groups' R&D lifecycle, launch plans, and related strategy--if you don't know a good timeframe, use 10 years). Discuss this person's views, behaviors, and choices in the past and how they have changed over time.
3. Under the first box, draw a third box that represents your future customer as he/she exists today. Name this future user, and his/her age will be the same starting age as your first customer. You may find it helpful to develop a detailed profile (persona) using data from interviews, generational studies, surveys, market reports, etc.
4. Draw an arrow forward from the third box that connects to a fourth box for your future user. This box represents the target future user. His/her age will be the same as today's customer.
5. Compare the two people at their starting ages and also at their target ages. You may find it helpful to develop a profile of the future user, which will include a mix of dominant generational values, similarities with todays, customer, and new differences extending from the young future user today.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Where can you find additional data about how people live today? How they lived in the past?
  * Do you want to grow the same market or pursue a new market for your future user.?
  * How representative is your future user of his or her generation?
  * How many additional future users should you develop to better capture a coming change in the generation's makeup?

## Futuretelling

Short and dramatic performances that illustrate a particular user need as a scene from the future. This is active storytelling at its best.

Instructions:

1. Determine the primary need or situation that you think helps show your future user best in a realistic situation.
2. Create a story about this user's situation. What are the circumstances, and what ar ethe peopel involved trying to accomplish?
3. Develop a simple script that outlines each person's dialogue and interactions in this story.
4. Identify acting roles for all the team members.
5. Find any supporting props that may help convey the story.
6. Present your performance to a live audience.
7. Listen to the reactions and questions from the audience, which may show well- or under-performed areas in yoru presentation.
8. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Did your audience react in the way you expected?
  * Did your audience ask questions that your team expected?
  * Which aspects of your story did the audience focus on? Why?
  * If you had a chance to perform the skit again, what would you change?

Planning points:
* Describe your future user in one sentence or less. What does your user care about the most?
* What do you want your audience to understand about your user's essential need(s)?
* What is the situation in the future? Keep it to a simple scene or two, if possible.
* What other people (or objects) will your user interact with in this situation?
* How do you want the audience to respond at the end of the situation?
