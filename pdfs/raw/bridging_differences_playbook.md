# Bridging Differences Playbook

## Self-Distancing

Distancing helps prevent us from being overwhelmed by emotions and helps us recognize alternative viewpoints.

1. How might a third party who wants the best for all involved think about it?
2. Shift from first-person to third-person. ie instead of "Why do I feel this way?" ask, "Why does Wesley feel this way?"
3. Taking a third-person perspective can be challenging. What obstacles do you face to doing so? What could help you overcome them?
4. Try to take this perspective during disagreements. Reflect on the outcome, how it makes you feel/think, and how this might impact future interactions.

## Mindfulness

Mindfulness helps us really pay attention and break out of the trap of heuristically classifying others.

1. Sit, bring awareness to breath, and notice any sounds that occur. Label as sound, noticing when they arise and fall away, any impact on the body, or tendency to tell stories of what the sound represents.
2. By developing the capacity to hear with less judgement, we prepare to hear words without reacting.
3. Pause, settle, and bring awareness to the experience of being with another. Only then do we speak.
4. The listener settles into presence, and listen to both the words spoken and the body language accompanying them.
5. Reflect.

## Perspective Taking

Negative attitudes often stem from limits of perspective. Deliberately taking their perspective builds empathy and makes then less foreign or alien to us.

1. Pick a person from whom you feel estranged or at odds.
2. Imagine you are this person. How might they experience shared situations with you? What does the world look like from their perspective.
3. Imagine how it feels to be them. What emotions are they experiencing, and how might they feel in their body? How might their feelings differ from yours? How do their unique life experiences contribute to their response?
4. If you are debating, imagine taking their side and formulating an argument on their behalf.
5. If you have time and capacity, imagine a day in the life of this person.
6. Reflect.

## People Before Politics

Seeing someone as a person, rather than an abstract Other, makes it more likely you will treat them with care and respect. By understanding how they developed their views we build empathy and are more able to navigate difficult conversations.

1. Learn more about the person, before you dig into politics. Here are some great suggestions:
    * Tell us about a moment in which you've been made to feel unwelcome, or misunderstood.
    * Tell us about someone from this community who makes you proud to call this place home.
    * Share a story about someone you love, but with whom you disagree about something.
    * Tell us about a common misconception or belief people on the outside hold about our community. Describe an experience you've had that would surprise them.
    * Tell us about a recent experience that gave you hope.
    * If the conversations around politics are unavoidable, it's helpful to ask questions like, "How did you develop this belief?" or "Who impacted the way you see the world the most in your life?" These questions focus on the reasons behind views, which help buld understandisg and relationships, even as we disagree.
2. Reflect

## Moral Reframing

Rather than trying to convince someone to agree with you, help them understand where you're coming from and learn where they are coming from.

1. Check your assumptions by asking questions like: "What are important values you try to uphold?" and "Who taught you those values, or what experiences formed them?"
2. Consider how these values are similar and different from your own. You don't need to agree, just seek to understand.
3. Even if you ultimately disagree, you will have gained something arguing from empathy rather than hostility.
4. Reflect and refine.

## Intergroup Contact

Getting to know people from other groups reduces misperceptions and biases, and fosters warmer feelings.

1. Think of two groups who are very different and not normally in contact.
2. Before inviting, set up these four conditions:
    * Support interactions with legitimate authorities, for instance a neutral mediator.
    * Identify a common goal.
    * Create a sense of interdependence through a shared stake in meeting the goal, incentivizing cooperation.
    * Create a sense of equal status.
3. Be wary of your own assumptions. Explicitly run these conditions past each group to get their feedback and buy-in before bringing them together.
4. Reflect and refine.

## Identify Common Goals

Appealing to enlightened self-interest can overcome hesitance to work/interact with those seen as different and move from a perception of adversaries to one of collaborators.

1. Strengthen relationships grounded in trust and open-mindedness.
2. Have each individual share their individual goals and what they sense might be shared goals.
3. Discuss and workshop until you've identified common goals.
4. Discuss nuts and bolts of common goals, and how others have been successful in the past.
5. Reflect and refine.

## Focus on Solutions, not Identities

People often agree on issues and even solutions, yet still feel at odds based on social or cultural identities. Staying focused on solutions allows less charged conversations, and more sense of unity.

1. Understand the issues and problems people want to address.
2. Get more nuanced and specific about the problems and what specific changes they would like to see. Seek to understand why they are interested in the issue.
3. Invite suggestions for solutions. This can help highlight unexpected alignment, help create appreciation for each other, and inspire hope/optimism as they rally around shared desire to tackle issues.
4. Reflect and refine.

## Focus on Individuality

By taking care to avoid seeing people through the lens of group membership we feel less threatened by those who might seem "not like us."

1. Ask questions about tastes and preferences. Even just thinking about this without asking can help. Be wary of questions that may elicit cultural stereotypes though. Some examples:
    * What's your favorite vegetable?
    * Do you prefer dogs or cats?
    * How do you like to exercise?
    * What's your favorite color?
    * What do you like better, staying up late or waking up early?
2. Reflect and refine.

## Find Shared Identities

Focusing on shared identity helps widen the sense of who we are and who is part of our "tribe". Identifying commonalities, without supressing differences, can make us more generous, empathic, and helpful.

1. Before meeting, create a list of defining characteristics you share, ideally write it down.
2. Review this list, ideally together. Does it feel accurate? Are there any identities missing?
3. Consider: How do these shared identities make you see the person in a new light. If possible, discuss.
4. Reflect and refine.

Note: Members of marginalized communities may not benefit from being asked to identify with members of a dominant group, especially if they feel they are being made invisible by the larger group identity.

# Seek and Promote Counter-Stereotypical Information

Being exposed to more information challenges stereotypes and can change our attitude to become more positive.

1. Acknowledge sterotypes that we hold based on group identity.
2. Consider where they come from, then seek out counter information to challenge them.
3. If possible, getting to know someone in the group and/or even asking "what are common misconceptions or stereotypes" can help.
4. You can also seek ount counter-stereotypical information through the news and content you consume.
5. Reflect and refine.

Note: The questions you ask may betray stereotypes and could feel offensive. Be clear about your intentions and let them know they can choose not to respond.

# Expand Your Activities, Expand Your Views

Exposure to new people, events, and experiences can fight prejudice by broadening our sense of what's comfortable and familiar.

1. Try things that make you uncomfortable, just to see what happens.
2. Approach experiences with questions and an open mind, avoid trying to change minds or criticize.
3. Bring others like you into your new experiences.
4. Reflect and refine.

# Assume Good Intentions

Suspending judgement helps us avoid perceptions of threat or hurt feelings, and focus on the issues being discussed.

1. When engaging with someone different, assume their intentions are good and positive.
2. If/when you feel slighted, try to hear the underlying comment for what it was intended to be rather than taking offense.
3. Recognize assumptions may be shaped by prejudice or past mistreatment. Try to remind yourself that this person is not the one who mistreated you.
4. Reflect and refine.

# Active Listening

We often fail to really hear others, missing opportunities to connect, while risking them feeling neglected, disrepected or resentful.

1. Find a quite place and invite the person to share what's on their mind. Use some combination of the following:
2. Paraphrase what you hear.
3. Ask questions, where possible asking for elaboration on thoughts and feelings. Try to avoid jumping to conclusions, and instead ask clarifying questions.
4. Express empathy, seeking to validate feelings.
5. Use engaged body language, making eye contact, nodding, facing them, using open/relaxed body posture, etc.
6. Take turns. After the other person has shared, ask if you can share your own thoughts. When sharing focus on "I" statements.
7. Reflect and refine.
