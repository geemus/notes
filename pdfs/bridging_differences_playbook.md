# Bridging Differences Playbook

## Self-Distancing

Distancing helps prevent emotional overwhelm and helps recognize alternative viewpoints.

1. How might a third party who wants the best for all involved think about it?
2. Shift from first-person to third-person. ie instead of "Why do I feel this way?" ask, "Why does Wesley feel this way?"
3. Taking a third-person perspective can be challenging. What obstacles do you face to doing so? What could help you overcome them?
4. Try to take this perspective during disagreements.
5. Reflect

## Mindfulness

Mindfulness helps really pay attention and helps break out of the trap of heuristically classifying others.

1. Sit, bringing awareness to the sound of breathing.
2. Notice sounds as things arise and fall away, labeling them while avoiding story telling.
3. Develop the capacity to hear with less judgement to prepare to hear words without reacting.
4. Pause, settle, and bring awareness of being with another. Only then do we speak.
5. Listen to both words spoken and the body language that accompany them.
6. Reflect

## Perspective Taking

Deliberate perspective taking builds empathy, makes others seem less foreign/alien, and helps reduce negative attitudes which often stem from limits of perspective.

1. Pick a person from who you feel estranged or at odds.
2. Imagine you are this person. How might they experience shared situations with you? What does the world look like to them?
3. Imagine how it feels to be them. What emotions might you experience? How might your body feel? How might these feelings differ from yours? How does their life experience contribute?
4. If you are debating, imagine taking their side and formulating an argument on their behalf.
5. If possible, imagine a day in the life of this person.
6. Reflect.

## People Before Politics

Understanding how someone developed their views helps build empathy, allowing us to see them as a person, rather than an abstract Other.

1. Focus on learning more about the person, before digging into politics. Some suggestions:
  * Share a moment when you were made to feel unwelcome, or misunderstood.
  * Share about someone in the community that makes you proud to call this home.
  * Share a story about someone you love, but with whom you disagree about something.
  * Share a common misconception of belief outsiders hold about our community. Describe an experience you've had that would surprise them.
  * Share a recent experience that gave you hope.
  * If it gets into harder topics, ask things like "How did you develop this belief?" or "Who impacted the way you see the world most in your life?". Understanding why views are held helps us build understanding and relationships, even when we disagree.
2. Reflect.

## Moral Reframing

Rather than trying to convince someone to agree, help them understand where you're coming from and learn where they are coming from.

1. Check assumptions by asking things like: "What are important values you try to uphold?" and "Who taught you those values, or what experiences formed them?"
2. Consider how these values compare to your own. You don't need to agree, just to try to understand.
3. Even if you still disagree, you will have gained by discussing from empathy rather than arguing from hostility.
4. Reflect.

## Intergroup Contact

Getting to know people from other groups reduces misperceptions and biases, and fosters warmer feelings.

1. Think of two groups who are very different and not normally in contact.
2. Setup these four conditions before bringing them to meet:
  1. Provide support from legitimate authorities, like a neutral mediator.
  2. Identify a common goal.
  3. Create a sense of interdepedence through a shared stake in meeting the goal.
  4. Create a sense of equal status.
3. Be wary of assumptions. Explicitly check these conditions with both groups for feedback and buy-in before meeting.
4. Reflect.

## Identify Common Goals

Appeal to enlightened self-interest to encourage a transition from adversaries to collaborators.

1. Strengthen relationships grounded in trust and open-mindedness.
2. Have individuals share individual goals and what they think might be shared goals.
3. Discuss and workshop until common goals are clear.
4. Discuss common goals and how others have succeeded in the past.
5. Reflect.

## Focus on Solutions, not Identities

People often agree on issues and even solutions, yet feel at odds based on identities. Focus on solutions allows less charged conversation, and more sense of unity.

1. Understand issues and problems people want to address.
2. Get specific about problems and changes they would like to see. Seek to understand why they are interested in the issue.
3. Invite suggested solutions. This can hightlight alignment, create appreciation, and inspire hope/optimism to rall around shared desire to tackle issues.
4. Reflect and refine.

# Focus on Individuality

Taking care to avoid seeing people as group members allow us to feel less threatened by those who seem "not like us."

1. Ask about tastes and preferences. Even just considering  this can help. Be wary of questions relating to cultural stereotypes though. Here are some good questions:
  * What's your favorite vegetable?
  * Do you prefer dogs or cats?
  * How do you like to exercise?
  * What's your favorite color?
  * What do you like better, staying up late or waking up early?
2. Reflect and refine.

## Find Shared Identities

Focusing on shared identities widens the sense of who we are and who is part of our "tribe." Identifying commonalities, without suppressing differences, can make us more generous, empathic, and helpful.

1. Before meeting, create a list of shared, defining characteristics. Ideally in writing.
2. Review the list, ideally together. Does it feel accurate. Are there any missing identities?
3. Consider: How do these shared identities make you see the person in a new light. If possible, discuss.
4. Reflect and refine.

Note: Members of morginalized communities may not benefit from being asked to identify with a dominant group, especially if they feel they are being made invisible.

## Seek and Promote Counter-Stereotypical Information

Being exposed to more information challenges stereotypes and can lead to a more positive attitude.

1. Acknowledge stereotypes held based on group identity.
2. Consider where they come from, then seek out counter information.
3. If possible, get to know someone in the group and/or ask them "what are common misconceptions or stereotypes."
4. You can also seek out counter-stereotypical information through the news and content you consume.
5. Reflect and refine.

Note: Questions you ask may betray stereotypes and feel offessive. Be clear about your intentions and let them know they can choose not to respond.

## Expand Your Activities, Expand Your Views

Exposure to new people, events, and experiences can fight prejudice by broudening our sense of what's comfortable and familiar.

1. Try things that make you uncomfortable, just to see what happens.
2. Approach experiences with questions and an open mind, avoid trying to change minds or criticize.
3. Bring others like you into you new experiences.
4. Reflect and refine.

## Assume Good Intentions

Suspending judgement helps avoid perceptions of threat or hurt feelings, and focuses on the issues being discussed.

1. When engaging with someone different, assume their intentions are good and positive.
2. If/when you feel slighted, try to understand what was intended rather than taking offense.
3. Recognize assumptions may be shaped by prejudice or past mistreatment. TRy to remind yourself that this person is not the one who mistreated you.
4. Reflect and refine.

## Active Listening

We often fail to really hear others, missing opportunities to connect, while risking them feeling neglected, disrespected or resentful.

1. Find a quiet place and invite the person to share what's on their mind. Use some combination of the following:
  * Paraphrase what you hear.
  * Ask questions, where possible for elaboration othoughts and feelings. Avoid jumping to conclusions, and instead ask for clarification.
  * Express empathy, seeking to validate feelings.
  * Use engaged body language, making eye contact, nodding, facing them, using open/relaxed body posture, etc.
2. After they have finished sharing, ask if you can share your own thoughts. When sharing, focus on "I" statements.
3. Reflect and refine.2. After they have finished sharing, ask if you can share your own thoughts. When sharing, focus on "I" statements.
