# How to Read a Book

* As you read, you either understand everything or you don't. If you do, you may have gained information, but not gained insight.
* After seeing what an author says, you must learn what they mean and why they say it.

## Inspectional Reading

1. Look at the title page and preface (if they exist).
2. Study the table of contents.
3. Check the index.
4. Read the publishers blurb.
5. Determine if you want or need to read more deeply.
6. Look at the chapters that seem central to it's argument.
7. Browse, reading a paragraph or two, occasionally a several pages, never more than that.
8. Read the last 2-3 pages of the main part of the book, few authors resist the temptation to summarize what they felt was important.

* Books should be read only as slowly as they deserve and no faster than you can comprehend.
* Do not try to understand every word or page of a difficult book the first time through.

### Questions Answered by Inspectional Reading

1. What kind of book is it?
2. What is it about as a whole?
3. What is the structural order of the work?

## Analytical Reading

### Finding Out What a Book is About

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
2. State what the whole book is about in a few sentences.
3. Enumerate major parts and their relation.
4. Define the problem(s) the author has tried to solve.

### Interpreting a Books Contents

1. Ascertain what the author means by key terms.
2. Find the most important sentences.
3. Know the argument being made, by finding the key sentences, or constructing it from a sequence of sentences.
4. Determine which problems were solved, which were not (and whether the author knew they failed).

### Rules for Criticizing

1. Suspend criticism until having completed your outline and interpretation.
2. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
3. Present good reasons for any critical judgement you make, lest it be mere personal opinion.

### Criteria for Criticism

1. Where is the author uninformed?
2. Where is the author misinformed?
3. Where is the author illogical?
4. Where is the author's analysis or account incomplete?

Note: If you are unable to find any of these faults, you must agree, at least in part.

## How to Read Practical Books

* "The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the recognition of it for what it is. Only hidden and undetected oratory is really insidious."
* If you are convinced by an author than something is worthy and that the recommended means are likely to achieve the results, it is hard to see how you can refuse to act in the way they wish.

## How to Read Imaginative Literature

* "Imaginative literature primarily pleases rather than teaches. It is much easier to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know why one is pleased. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth."
* Read novels quickly and with total immersion, with an eye only to whether it could have happened in the world the novelist has created.
* Distinguish between books that satisfy our own needs and those that speak to more universal needs.

## How to Read Stories, Plays, and Poems

* To best understand some passages, it may help to read them aloud.
* To understand a play you are reading, you must do the mental work of stage direction as well to fill in the full details.

## How to Read History

* You should read more than one accounting of an event or period that interests you.
* You should read history not only to know what happened, but also how people acti in all times and places, especially now.
* The greater the condensation, the more important one knows the character of the condenser.

## How to Read Science and Mathematics

* "Scientific objectivity is not the absence of initial bias. It is attained by frank confession of it."
* Read classic science texts not to understand the subject matter, but to underst the history and philosophy of science.
* You must also supplement reading with direct experience of crucial experiments to fully understand.
* Mathematics is like any other language, and can be learned with sufficient effort.

## How to Read Philosophy

* "If we are to follow them we too must be childishly simple in our questions - and maturely wise in our replies."
* You should seek to find the controlling principles of the author and decide whether they are adhered to throughout.
* If the author is inconsistent, decide if the first principles, the conclusions, or both are invalid.

## Syntopical Reading

### Surveying Prior to Syntopical Reading

1. Create a tentative bibliography
2. Inspect all book in the bibliography

### Syntopical Reading of Bibliography

1. Inspect the books already identified as relevant to find the most relevant passages.
2. Construct a neutral terminology which can be used across authors.
3. Establish a set of qusetions to which all authors can be interpreted as giving anser to.
4. Define the issues by arranging answer of authors to the questions or one side of the issue or the other.
5. Analyze the discussion by arranging questions and issues to shed maximum light on the subject. More general should precede less general and relations should be clearly indicated.

Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to foster this is to always accompany interpretations of an author's views with actual quotations.

# How to Read a Book by Charles Van Doren and Mortimer J. Adler
- But knowledge is not as much a prerequisite to understanding as is commonly supposed. We do not have to know everything about something in order to understand it; too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding. (4)
- A piece of writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intended to the whole of it. The amount the reader “catches” will usually depend on the amount of activity he puts into the process, as well as upon the skill with which he executes the different mental acts involved. (6)
- As you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not have increased your understanding. (7)
- Enlightenment is achieved only when, in addition to knowing what an author says, you know what he means and why he says it. (11)
- The art of reading, in short, includes all of the same skills that are involved in the art of unaided discovery: keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect trained in analysis and reflection. (14)
- Whereas the question that is asked at the first level is “What does the sentence say?” the question typically asked at this level is “What is the book about?” That is a surface question; others of a similar nature are “What is the structure of the book?” or “What are its parts?” (18)
- With the help of the books read, the syntopical reader is able to construct an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books. (20)
- LOOK AT THE TITLE PAGE AND, IF THE BOOK HAS ONE, AT ITS PREFACE. (32)
- STUDY THE TABLE OF CONTENTS (33)
- CHECK THE INDEX (34)
- READ THE PUBLISHER’S BLURB. (34)
- Upon completing these first four steps you may already have enough information about the book to know that you want to read it more carefully, or that you do not want or need to read it at all. In either case, you may put it aside for the moment. If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the book, properly speaking. (34)
- LOOK NOW AT THE CHAPTERS THAT SEEM TO BE PIVOTAL TO ITS ARGUMENT. (35)
- Finally, TURN THE PAGES, DIPPING IN HERE AND THERE, READING A PARAGRAPH OR TWO, SOMETIMES SEVERAL PAGES IN SEQUENCE, NEVER MORE THAN THAT. (35)
- Above all, do not fail to read the last two or three pages, or, if these are an epilogue, the last few pages of the main part of the book. Few authors are able to resist the temptation to sum up what they think is new and important about their work in these pages. (35)
- Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. (43)
- Finally, do not try to understand every word or page of a difficult book the first time through. (43)
- WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT AS A WHOLE? (46)
- WHAT IS BEING SAID IN DETAIL, AND HOW? (47)
- IS THE BOOK TRUE, IN WHOLE OR PART? (47)
- WHAT OF IT? (47)
- The questions answered by inspectional reading are: first, what kind of book is it? second, what is it about as a whole? and third, what is the structural order of the work whereby the author develops his conception or understanding of that general subject matter? (51)
- The first rule of analytical reading can be expressed as follows: RULE 1. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ. (60)
- We have already discussed a rough classification of books. The main distinction, we said, was between works of fiction, on the one hand, and works conveying knowledge, or expository works, on the other hand. Among expository works, we can further distinguish history from philosophy, and both from science and mathematics. (64)
- To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from knowing what is the case to knowing what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere. This can be summarized in the distinction between knowing that and knowing how. Theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do. (66)
- Questions about the validity of something are theoretical, whereas to raise questions about the end of anything, the purpose it serves, is practical. (68)
- A practical book will soon betray its character by the frequent occurrence of such words as “should” and “ought,” “good” and “bad,” “ends” and “means.” (69)
- In contrast, a theoretical book keeps saying “is,” not “should” or “ought.” (69)
- The essence of history is narration. History is knowledge of particular events or things that not only existed in the past but also underwent a series of changes in the course of time. (70)
- Science is not concerned with the past as such. It treats of matters that can happen at any time or place. The scientist seeks laws or generalizations. He wants to find out how things happen for the most part or in every case, not, as the historian does, how some particular things happened at a given time and place in the past. (70)
- Philosophy is like science and unlike history in that it seeks general truths rather than an account of particular events, either in the near or distant past. But the philosopher does not ask the same questions as the scientist, nor does he employ the same kind of method to answer them. (71)
- If a theoretical book emphasizes things that lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is a scientific work. If not, it is philosophical. (71)
- This does not mean that the philosopher is a pure thinker and the scientist merely an observer. Both have to observe and think, but they think about different sorts of observations. And however they may have arrived at the conclusions that they want to prove, they prove them in different ways, the scientist by pointing to the results of his special experiences, the philosopher by pointing to experiences that are common to all. (72)
- RULE 2. STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH). (75)
- RULE 3. SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE. (76)
- If, after you have attained sufficient skill, no amount of effort on your part results in your apprehension of the unity of a book, and if you are also not able to discern its parts and their relation to one another, then very likely the book is a bad one, whatever its reputation. (91)
- RULE 4. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S PROBLEMS WERE. (92)
- For the communication to be successfully completed, therefore, it is necessary for the two parties to use the same words with the same meanings—in short, to come to terms. When that happens, communication happens, the miracle of two minds with but a single thought. (97)
- RULE 5. FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR. (98)
- From your point of view as a reader, therefore, the most important words are those that give you trouble. (102)
- A proposition in a book is also a declaration. It is an expression of the author’s judgment about something. He affirms something he thinks to be true, or denies something he judges to be false. He asserts this or that to be a fact. A proposition of this sort is a declaration of knowledge, not intentions. The author may tell us his intentions at the beginning in a preface. In an expository book, he usually promises to instruct us about something. To find out whether he keeps those promises, we must look for his propositions. (113)
- But unless we are exclusively interested in the author’s personality, we should not be satisfied with knowing what his opinions are. His propositions are nothing but expressions of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons. If it is the book and the subject with which it deals that we are interested in, and not just the author, we want to know not merely what his propositions are, but also why he thinks we should be persuaded to accept them. (114)
- The presence of arguments is indicated by other words that relate statements, such as: if this is so, then that; or, since this, therefore that; or, it follows from this, that that is the case. (114)
- RULE 6. MARK THE MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN A BOOK AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY CONTAIN. (119)
- RULE 7. LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT THE BASIC ARGUMENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF SENTENCES. (119)
- From your point of view as a reader, the sentences important for you are those that require an effort of interpretation because, at first sight, they are not perfectly intelligible. You understand them just well enough to know there is more to understand. (120)
- If you never ask yourself any questions about the meaning of a passage, you cannot expect the book to give you any insight you do not already possess. (121)
- There are only two differences between finding the terms that words express and the propositions that sentences express. One is that you employ a larger context in the latter case. You bring all the surrounding sentences to bear on the sentence in question, just as you used the surrounding words to interpret a particular word. (123)
- The other difference lies in the fact that complicated sentences usually express more than one proposition. (124)
- Unless you can show some acquaintance with actual or possible facts to which the proposition refers or is relevant somehow, you are playing with words, not dealing with thought and knowledge. (126)
- Because of all this, we suggest another formulation of RULE 7, as follows: FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE ITS IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT. (128)
- One of the most familiar tricks of the orator or propagandist is to leave certain things unsaid, things that are highly relevant to the argument, but that might be challenged if they were made explicit. (129)
- Every line of argument, in other words, must start somewhere. Basically, there are two ways or places in which it can start: with assumptions agreed on between writer and reader, or with what are called self-evident propositions, which neither the writer nor reader can deny. (131)
- RULE 8. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S SOLUTIONS ARE. (133)
- The activity of reading does not stop with the work of understanding what a book says. It must be completed by the work of criticism, the work of judging. (137)
- RULE 9. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, “I UNDERSTAND,” BEFORE YOU CAN SAY ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS: “I AGREE,” OR “I DISAGREE,” OR “I SUSPEND JUDGMENT.” (141)
- if they cannot repeat what you have said in their own words, you know that they do not understand, and you are entirely justified in ignoring their criticisms. (142)
- To say “I don’t understand” is, of course, also a critical judgment, but only after you have tried your hardest does it reflect on the book rather than yourself. (143)
- RULE 10, and it can be expressed thus: WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SO REASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTATIOUSLY OR CONTENTIOUSLY. (144)
- But if he realizes that the only profit in conversation, with living or dead teachers, is what one can learn from them, if he realizes that you win only by gaining knowledge, not by knocking the other fellow down, he may see the futility of mere contentiousness. (145)
- what we have just said applies to the great majority of disagreements. They can be resolved by the removal of misunderstanding or of ignorance. Both cures are usually possible, though often difficult. Hence the person who, at any stage of a conversation, disagrees, should at least hope to reach agreement in the end. He should be as much prepared to have his own mind changed as seek to change the mind of another. He should always keep before him the possibility that he misunderstands or that he is ignorant on some point. No one who looks upon disagreement as an occasion for teaching another should forget that it is also an occasion for being taught. (146)
- RULE 11, therefore, can be stated as follows: RESPECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND MERE PERSONAL OPINION BY GIVING REASONS FOR ANY CRITICAL JUDGMENT YOU MAKE. (148)
- Knowledge, if you please, consists in those opinions that can be defended, opinions for which there is evidence of one kind or another. If we really know something, in this sense, we must believe that we can convince others of what we know. Opinion, in the sense in which we have been employing the word, is unsupported judgment. (149)
- Since men are animals as well as rational, it is necessary to acknowledge the emotions you bring to a dispute, or those that arise in the course of it. Otherwise you are likely to be giving vent to feelings, not stating reasons. (152)
- Second, you must make your own assumptions explicit. You must know what your prejudices—that is, your prejudgments—are. Otherwise you are not likely to admit that your opponent may be equally entitled to different assumptions. Good controversy should not be a quarrel about assumptions. (153)
- Third and finally, an attempt at impartiality is a good antidote for the blindness that is almost inevitable in partisanship. Controversy without partisanship is, of course, impossible. (153)
- The four points can be briefly summarized by conceiving the reader as conversing with the author, as talking back. After he has said, “I understand but I disagree,” he can make the following remarks to the author: (1) “You are uninformed”; (2) “You are misinformed”; (3) “You are illogical—your reasoning is not cogent”; (4) “Your analysis is incomplete.” (154)
- But, we should add, the reader cannot make any of these remarks without being definite and precise about the respect in which the author is uninformed or misinformed or illogical. (154)
- Furthermore, the reader who makes any of these remarks must not only make it definitely, by specifying the respect, but he must also support his point. (154)
- If you have not been able to show that the author is uninformed, misinformed, or illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. (158)
- I. THE FIRST STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR FINDING WHAT A BOOK IS ABOUT 1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. 2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. 3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. 4. Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve. II. THE SECOND STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR INTERPRETING A BOOK’S CONTENTS 5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words. 6. Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences. 7. Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences. 8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve. III. THE THIRD STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR CRITICIZING A BOOK AS A COMMUNICATION OF KNOWLEDGE A. General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette 9. Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”) 10. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously. 11. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make. B. Special Criteria for Points of Criticism 12. Show wherein the author is uninformed. 13. Show wherein the author is misinformed. 14. Show wherein the author is illogical. 15. Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete. Note: Of these last four, the first three are criteria for disagreement. Failing in all of these, you must agree, at least in part, although you may suspend judgment on the whole, in the light of the last point. (161)
- In the natural course of events, a good student frequently becomes a teacher, and so, too, a good reader becomes an author. (164)
- Common experience is available to all men and women just because they are alive. Special experience must be actively sought and is available only to those who go to the trouble of acquiring it. The best example of special experience is an experiment in a laboratory, but a laboratory is not always required. (167)
- Common experience is most relevant to the reading of fiction, on the one hand, and to the reading of philosophy, on the other. (168)
- Special experience is mainly relevant to the reading of scientific works. (169)
- Both common and special experience are relevant to the reading of history books. (169)
- You must know what you want to know; you must know in what reference work to find it; you must know how to find it in the reference work; and you must know that it is considered knowable by the authors or compilers of the book. (175)
- The most important thing to remember about any practical book is that it can never solve the practical problems with which it is concerned. A theoretical book can solve its own problems. But a practical problem can only be solved by action itself. (189)
- Practical books can, however, state more or less general rules that apply to a lot of particular situations of the same sort. (189)
- In other words, the reader himself must add something to the book to make it applicable in practice. He must add his knowledge of the particular situation and his judgment of how the rule applies to the case. (189)
- Practical books thus fall into two main groups. Some, like this one, or a cookbook, or a driver’s manual, are primarily presentations of rules. (190)
- The other kind of practical book is primarily concerned with the principles that generate rules. (190)
- In the other kind of practical books, the kind dealing mainly with the principles underlying rules, the major propositions and arguments will, of course, look exactly like those in a purely theoretical book. (191)
- Since the ultimate problems to be solved are practical—problems of action, in fields where men can do better or worse—an intelligent reader of such books about “practical principles” always reads between the lines or in the margins. He tries to see the rules that may not be expressed but that can, nevertheless, be derived from the principles. He goes further. He tries to figure out how the rules should be applied in practice. (191)
- In judging a practical book, everything turns on the ends or goals. (192)
- This brief discussion gives you a clue to the two major questions you must ask yourself in reading any sort of practical book. The first is: What are the author’s objectives? The second is: What means for achieving them is he proposing? (193)
- The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the recognition of it for what it is. Only hidden and undetected oratory is really insidious. (194)
- Agreement with a practical book, however, does imply action on your part. If you are convinced or persuaded by the author that the ends he proposes are worthy, and if you are further convinced or persuaded that the means he recommends are likely to achieve those ends, then it is hard to see how you can refuse to act in the way the author wishes you to. (196)
- Imaginative literature primarily pleases rather than teaches. It is much easier to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know why one is pleased. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth. (199)
- Don’t try to resist the effect that a work of imaginative literature has on you. (200)
- Don’t look for terms, propositions, and arguments in imaginative literature. (201)
- When we read a novel we want a story that must be true only in the sense that it could have happened in the world of characters and events that the novelist has created, and re-created in us. (202)
- (1) You must classify a work of imaginative literature according to its kind. (204)
- (2) You must grasp the unity of the whole work. (204)
- You have not grasped the whole story until you can summarize its plot in a brief narration—not a proposition or an argument. Therein lies its unity. (204)
- (3) You must not only reduce the whole to its simplest unity, but you must also discover how that whole is constructed out of all its parts. (205)
- To know the structure of a narrative, you must know where it begins—which is not necessarily on the first page, of course—what it goes through, and where it comes out at. You must know the various crises that lead up to the climax, where and how the climax occurs, and what happens in the aftermath. (205)
- (1) The elements of fiction are its episodes and incidents, its characters, and their thoughts, speeches, feelings, and actions. (206)
- (2) Terms are connected in propositions. The elements of fiction are connected by the total scene or background against which they stand out in relief. (206)
- The fictional analogue of the rule that directs you to find the author’s propositions can, therefore, be stated as follows: become at home in this imaginary world; know it as if you were an observer on the scene; become a member of its population, willing to befriend its characters, and able to participate in its happenings by sympathetic insight, as you would do in the actions and sufferings of a friend. (206)
- Far from spoiling your enjoyment of a novel or play, they should enable you to enrich your pleasure by knowing intimately the sources of your delight. You will not only know what you like but also why you like it. (207)
- don’t criticize imaginative writing until you fully appreciate what the author has tried to make you experience. (207)
- The reasons you give will, of course, have some critical relevance to the book itself, but in their first expression they are more likely to be about you—your preferences and prejudices—than about the book. Hence, to complete the task of criticism, you must objectify your reactions by pointing to those things in the book that caused them. You must pass from saying what you like or dislike and why, to saying what is good or bad about the book and why. (208)
- If you feel impelled because of a book you have read to go out and do something, ask yourself whether the work contains some implied statement that has produced this feeling. (212)
- But you should remember that you are then taking heed of and reacting to something other than the story or poem itself. That subsists in its own right. To read it well, all you have to do is experience it. (212)
- The first piece of advice we would like to give you for reading a story is this: Read it quickly and with total immersion. (212)
- A story is like life itself; in life, we do not expect to understand events as they occur, at least with total clarity, but looking back on them, we do understand. (214)
- All of this comes down to the same point: you must finish a story in order to be able to say that you have read it well. (214)
- Thus, in criticizing fiction we must be careful to distinguish those books that satisfy our own particular unconscious needs—the ones that make us say, “I like this book, although I don’t really know why”—from those that satisfy the deep unconscious needs of almost everybody. (216)
- When you read a play, you are not reading a complete work. The complete play (the work that the author intended you to apprehend) is only apprehended when it is acted on a stage. (218)
- Therefore, once you have discovered what the play is about, as a whole and in detail, and once you have answered the other questions you must ask about any story, then try directing the play. Imagine that you have half a dozen good actors before you, awaiting your commands. Tell them how to say this line, how to play that scene. Explain the importance of these few words, and how that action is the climax of the work. You will have a lot of fun, and you will learn a lot about the play. (218)
- it is often desirable to read a puzzling passage out loud. Read slowly, as if an audience were listening, and with “expression”—that is, (220)
- The first is to remember that the essence of tragedy is time, or rather the lack of it. There is no problem in any Greek tragedy that could not have been solved if there had been enough time, but there is never enough. (221)
- First, lyric poetry, even modern poetry, does not always demand as much work as you may think if you go about reading it in the right way. Second, it is often worth whatever effort you are willing to spend. (223)
- The first rule to follow in reading a lyric is to read it through without stopping, whether you think you understand it or not. (223)
- The second rule for reading lyrics is this: Read the poem through again—but read it out loud. (224)
- Let us sum up these two suggestions for reading history. The first is: if you can, read more than one history of an event or period that interests you. The second is: read a history not only to learn what really happened at a particular time and place in the past, but also to learn the way men act in all times and places, especially now. (236)
- The first criticism is, however, more important. A good historian must combine the talents of the storyteller and the scientist. He must know what is likely to have happened as well as what some witnesses or writers said actually did happen. (237)
- The main answer to the question, What of it?, therefore, lies in the direction of practical, political action. For this reason it is of great importance that history be read well. (238)
- when reading Aristotle, or Dante, or Shakespeare. But the author of any contemporary book may have—though he does not necessarily have—an interest in your understanding it in a certain way. Or if he does not, the sources of his information may have such an interest. You should know that interest, and take it into account in whatever you read. (246)
- Hence the greater the condensation, the more important it is that we know something of the character of the condenser; the same caveat we mentioned before applies here with even greater force. (248)
- As a layman, you do not read the classical scientific books to become knowledgeable in their subject matters in a contemporary sense. Instead, you read them to understand the history and philosophy of science. That, indeed, is the layman’s responsibility with regard to science. (251)
- Scientific objectivity is not the absence of initial bias. It is attained by frank confession of it. (252)
- Anyone who desires to acquire an understanding of the history of science must not only read the classical texts, but must also become acquainted, through direct experience, with the crucial experiments in that history. (253)
- We are not told, or not told early enough so that it sinks in, that mathematics is a language, and that we can learn it like any other, including our own. (254)
- If your intention is to read a mathematical book in and for itself, you must read it, of course, from beginning to end—and with a pencil in your hand, for writing in the margins and even on a scratch pad is more necessary here than in the case of any other kinds of books. But your intention may not be that, but instead to read a scientific work that has mathematics in it. In this case, skipping is often the better part of valor. (258)
- They can be read without too much difficulty if you always keep in mind that your primary obligation is not to become competent in the subject matter but instead to understand the problem. (260)
- First, they contain relatively few descriptions of experiments (instead, they merely report the results of experiments). Second, they contain relatively little mathematics (unless they are popular books about mathematics itself  ). (260)
- But we do want you to recognize that one of the most remarkable things about the great philosophical books is that they ask the same sort of profound questions that children ask. The ability to retain the child’s view of the world, with at the same time a mature understanding of what it means to retain it, is extremely rare—and a person who has these qualities is likely to be able to contribute something really important to our thinking. (265)
- If we are to follow them we too must be childishly simple in our questions—and maturely wise in our replies. (265)
- The questions may be stated explicitly, or they may be implicit to a certain extent. In either case, you must try to find out what they are. How the author answers these questions will be deeply affected by his controlling principles. These may be stated, too, but that is not always the case. (280)
- Once you have found an author’s controlling principles, you will want to decide whether he adheres to them throughout his work. (282)
- If a philosopher is inconsistent, you have to decide which of two sets of propositions he really means—the first principles, as he states them; or the conclusions, which do not in fact follow from the principles as stated. Or you may decide that neither is valid. (282)
- When you have read a philosophical book well—and that means reading other philosophers on the same subject, too—you are in a position to judge. (285)
- The faithful reader of a canonical book is obliged to make sense out of it and to find it true in one or another sense of “true.” If he cannot do this by himself, he is obliged to go to someone who can. (288)
- The first thing to do when you have amassed your bibliography is to inspect all of the books on your list. You should not read any of them analytically before inspecting all of them. (306)
- First, it will give you a clear enough idea of your subject so that your subsequent analytical reading of some of the books on the list is productive. And second, it will allow you to cut down your bibliography to a more manageable size. (306)
- STEP 1 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: FINDING THE RELEVANT PASSAGES. (308)
- In syntopical reading, it is you and your concerns that are primarily to be served, not the books that you read. (308)
- STEP 2 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: BRINGING THE AUTHORS TO TERMS. (310)
- Not only must we resolutely refuse to accept the terminology of any one author; we must also be willing to face the possibility that no author’s terminology will be useful to us. (310)
- This means that as we proceed on our project of syntopical reading we must begin to build up a set of terms that first, helps us to understand all of our authors, not just one or a few of them, and second, helps us to solve our problem. (311)
- STEP 3 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: GETTING THE QUESTIONS CLEAR. (311)
- we are faced with the task of establishing a set of neutral propositions as well. The best way to do this is to frame a set of questions that shed light on our problem, and to which each of our authors gives answers. (311)
- The difficulty is that the questions we want answered may not have been seen as questions by the authors. (311)
- STEP 4 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: DEFINING THE ISSUES. (312)
- STEP 5 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: ANALYZING THE DISCUSSION. (313)
- The truth, then, insofar as it can be found—the solution to the problem, insofar as that is available to us—consists rather in the ordered discussion itself than in any set of propositions or assertions about it. (314)
- The special quality that a syntopical analysis tries to achieve can, indeed, be summarized in the two words “dialectical objectivity.” (315)
- The syntopical reader, in short, tries to look at all sides and to take no sides. Of course, he will fail in this exacting ideal. (315)
- when summaries of an author’s argument are presented, they must be presented in that language and not the author’s. But the author’s own words, carefully quoted so as not to wrench them out of context, must accompany the summary, so that the reader can judge for himself whether the interpretation of the author is correct. (316)
- That paradox can be stated thus: Unless you know what books to read, you cannot read syntopically, but unless you can read syntopically, you do not know what to read. (320)
- I. SURVEYING THE FIELD PREPARATORY TO SYNTOPICAL READING 1. Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books. 2. Inspect all of the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which are germane to your subject, and also to acquire a clearer idea of the subject. Note: These two steps are not, strictly speaking, chronologically distinct; that is, the two steps have an effect on each other, with the second, in particular, serving to modify the first. II. SYNTOPICAL READING OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY AMASSED IN STAGE I 1. Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage I in order to find the most relevant passages. 2. Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not. 3. Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not. 4. Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the authors’ views on matters that may not have been their primary concern. 5. Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated. Note: Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to insure this is always to accompany an interpretation of an author’s views on an issue with an actual quotation from his text. (326)
- If you are reading in order to become a better reader, you cannot read just any book or article. (330)
- We are not against amusement in its own right, but we do want to stress that improvement in reading skill does not accompany it. The same goes for a book that merely informs you of facts that you did not know without adding to your understanding of those facts. (330)
