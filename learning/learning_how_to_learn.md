# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects

## Chunks

* Our working memory has roughly four available chunks, formed of thoughts bound together through meaning or use.
* Focused learning allows us to acquire new chunks.
* Deliberate practice and spaced repitition re-enforce memory and test/revise our understanding.
  * Focusing on what is hardest first is often the best strategy.
  * If you get stuck, trying easier problems and then returning can take advantage of background, diffuse mode processing.
* Each time we revisit a memory, consolidation allows us to add new information and context before storing it back.
  * We must avoid einstellung, or getting stuck in initial impressions or familiar ways of thinking, rather than revising as more is learned.
  * Taking a step back and rechecking can help us catch errors/blindspots, as can working with others.
* By synthesizing a deeper understanding, we are able to compact smaller, concrete chunks into fewer, abstract chunks, which will now require less working memory to recall. Muscle memory, for example, is a collection of individual actions that can now be thought of all as one more complex action.
  * Interleaving different ideas/types/procedures after acquiring the basic idea can contextualize your understanding and build your creativity.
  * By providing an existing foundation of possible interrelations, existing chunks also tend to make further chunks easier to acquire.
* In a given session, repitition will only get you so far before you need to take a break so that diffuse mode can contextualize, and organize the new information.
* Sleep washes toxins away, remove inactive patterns, and allows us to dream practice/repititions to reenforce active patterns.

## Habits and Procrastination

* Willpower is difficult and costly, so we should utilize it as a last resort.
  * Focus on using it to change your response to cues and you can build habits that reduce how much willpower is needed.
* Focusing on the process, rather than the product, can be helpful to avoid procrastination.

### Parts of Habits:

* cue - the trigger that launches you into the pattern. Usually location, time, how you feel, or reactions.
* routine - the habitual response to the cue
* reward - your reward for the routine, ie procrastination feels good immediately by avoiding something you think won't be enjoyable
* belief - your beliefs about habits lends them their power and longevity

### How to Change Habits:

* Be aware of cues and control them when you can.
* Make a plan for changing your response to cues.
* Reward yourself when you succeed, with bigger rewards for bigger accomplishments.
* Believe that you can make changes and they will be worth it.

## Task Lists

* Managing a task list helps free up working memory that would otherwise be needed for your todos.
* Building a task list the day before allows your diffuse memory to make progress by the time you get started.
* Prioritizing the list gives a chance to put the hardest or least fun things first, when you have more focus and willpower to address them.
* Including non-work, breaks, and stopping time can help keep you focused, on task, and rewarded appropriately.

## Memory

* Evolutionary pressure emphasized a need for visual and spatial memory.
* We can take advantage of visual/spatial memory by using visual metaphors and analagoies.
  * Vividly imagining what it would be like if you were the embodiement of a concept can be a good approach.
  * Funnier, more evocative, and/or stranger things are more memorable.
  * Metaphors and analogies can help break us out of einstellan.
* We can actively create meaningful groups, such as mnemonics, acronyms, and visual hints, in order to short cut the chunking process.
