# Brave New Work: Are You Ready to Reinvent Your Organization? by Aaron Dignan

- In the face of complexity, our Legacy Organizations—the traditional institutions that make up much of the modern world—are failing us, and we know it. Yet we do nothing, paralyzed by the fear of losing whatever control we have left. [74]
- Somehow, in less than a lifetime, modern work has become indistinguishable from sabotage. [110]
- If I showed you a house, a car, a dress, or a phone from 1910 and asked you whether it was modern or antique, you’d have a pretty good idea. Because almost everything has changed. But not management. Not really. Information flows up. Decisions flow down. [123]
- The way of working that we know best isn’t serving us, but it’s hard to trust the alternative. [164]
- This is not only possible; it is already happening inside organizations around the world. [178]
- They use purpose, transparency, and reputation to create cultures of freedom and responsibility. They are intentional but full of serendipity. They are decentralized but coherent. Above all, these firms are People Positive and Complexity Conscious—two foundational mindsets that we’ll explore in detail. [181]
- I refer to these iconoclasts as Evolutionary Organizations because they use these mindsets to collectively and continuously improve their shared OS. This isn’t just a way of being; it’s a way of doing. It is a practice. And whether you’re leading a team of ten or ten thousand, improving your OS is the single most powerful thing you can do. That is the promise of this book. [183]
- Unfortunately, in their desire to be agile (with a lowercase a), many firms have attempted to do Agile (with an uppercase A). They have traded a goal for an orthodoxy—adopting the methods and certifications but not the theory behind them. And this is fatal. Because an agile workflow is not an operating system. [279]
- Agility is a mindset, not a tool set. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the whole thing. It is necessary but not sufficient. [290]
- Sure, they had a pretty good idea of how long it took to produce a specific part. But no one was asking how long it should take. [307]
- Instead of a means to an end, hitting the plan became an end unto itself. [356]
- It’s a hidden debt—an organizational debt—that we pay interest on every day. [401]
- I define organizational debt as any structure or policy that no longer serves an organization. [410]
- One of the most common sources of org debt is the knee-jerk reaction. Every time something goes wrong, we immediately jump to create a constraint that will prevent future mistakes. [412]
- Another source of org debt is change. [417]
- The question that must be asked is “What would we do if we were starting with a blank sheet of paper?” If the answer is anything other than what we’ve got, we have work to do. [421]
- The point is this: to avoid the pitfalls of organizational debt, we need constant and vigilant simplification. We need to create roles, rules, and processes that are inherently agile—built to learn and change. [423]
- Corporate return on assets—the ratio of a company’s profits to what it owns and owes—is one of the best holistic measures of performance. While return on equity or returns to shareholders are more common, they are too vulnerable to financial engineering. Assets are harder to game. [454]
- Corporations might be getting bigger, but they’re not getting better at generating value from their assets. [458]
- They do all this to hit their numbers. And they do. Miraculously they do. Income goes up. Cash goes up. And generating ROA gets just a little bit harder, because what’s left behind is hollowed out. [465]
- There’s just one problem: mergers and acquisitions don’t work, or at least not the way we’ve been led to believe. [469]
- It seems likely that our economy is demonstrating what systems designers call graceful degradation. It’s functional even as parts of the system are failing us. This failure isn’t catastrophic. Not yet. [499]
- Evolutionary Organizations may operate in vastly different categories and cultures, yet what I’ve found in talking to them is that these communities all share two crucial mindsets. When it comes to human nature, development, and motivation, they are People Positive. But they also share a deep appreciation for the dynamic and interconnected context in which we operate, a mindset I refer to as Complexity Conscious. [540]

### PEOPLE POSITIVE [546]

- On-time delivery isn’t a goal; it’s a social expectation. Beyond that, workers aren’t incentivized by local performance indicators that might pit them against one another. They simply get a share of the total profits of the firm. [559]
- The dominant view, the one held by Legacy Organizations the world over, paints a mechanistic picture of who we are—conditioned by rewards and punishments, our futures dictated by our pasts. This mindset assumes that we don’t really want to work or learn without an incentive to do so. Ergo, we must be coerced and controlled in the service of organizations and society. [566]
- Organizations everywhere, contends that we have an innate desire to fulfill our potential and self-actualize. Rooted in the work of psychologists such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, this view maintains that people are naturally motivated and capable of self-direction. That we are worthy of trust and respect. And importantly, that we are all chameleons, capable of suppressing or distorting our true nature depending on our environment and social context. Ultimately, the People Positive leader believes that when it comes to human beings, we show up the way we are expected to show up—the way we are treated. [572]
- Over many years of collaboration and study, their groundbreaking work evolved into self-determination theory. They proposed that we have three innate psychological needs that drive and shape our behavior: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. [628]
- Their theory states that we come into the world naturally curious and ready to explore. We don’t lack motivation to learn and grow; it’s built in. And this innate sense of autonomy can be enhanced or undermined. [631]
- In the context of work, the implications are pretty simple. Increase autonomy, and motivation thrives. Decrease it, and motivation erodes. [633]
- We cannot do the best work of our lives under the auspices of an OS that presumes our stupidity, our laziness, and our untrustworthiness. When it comes to people, in many ways you get what you design for. Evolutionary Organizations know that if you treat people like mercenaries, they will become mercenaries. Treat them like all-stars and they will become all-stars. To be People Positive is to assume and expect the best of everyone. [643]

### COMPLEXITY CONSCIOUS [646]

- A complicated system is a causal system—meaning it is subject to cause and effect. [661]
- A complex system is not causal, it’s dispositional. We can make informed guesses about what it is likely to do (its disposition), but we can’t be sure. [668]
- Unlike complicated problems, complex problems cannot be solved, only managed. They cannot be controlled, only nudged. [670]
- As a result, complex systems are more about the relationships and interactions among their components than about the components themselves. [674]
- While many of the activities and outputs of organizations are indeed complicated, the organization itself is complex. Accordingly, organizational culture isn’t a problem to be solved; it’s an emergent phenomenon that we have to cultivate. [681]
- The mainstream view is that performance is the result of compliance. If we can just get everyone to do exactly as we say, we will achieve our goals. This translates into a culture buried in governing constraints—rules, policies, or processes for every imaginable scenario that dictate exactly what should be done. [685]
- But Complexity Conscious leaders view performance as the result of collective intelligence, emergence, and self-regulation. If we can just create the right conditions, everyone will continually find ways to achieve our goals. This translates into a culture that is made coherent and free by enabling constraints—agreements that create freedom to use judgment and interaction in the vast majority of situations. [687]
- Model what good choices look like with your own behavior. Then stand back and see what unfolds. [703]
- But our bureaucracies are no match for complexity. They can’t handle the surprises that we face every day, and worse, they’ll never surprise us with an unexpected breakthrough. [704]
- Why do we reject innovative approaches when they are clearly better? Behavioral economists have a name for this: the status quo bias. [719]
- But incremental improvement can be a trap. Scientific Management reveals only the best way to do what we’re already doing. True innovation often requires a departure from the safety of the status quo. [728]
- Which brings us to one of the most important things leaders and teams need to internalize: our way of working is completely made up. This isn’t the way it has to be, or even the way it always was. [736]
- Statistician George Box once said, “All models are wrong; some models are useful.” As we forge ahead, I invite you to discover what is useful to you. [739]

## PURPOSE How we orient and steer; the reason for being at the heart of any organization, team, or individual. [804]

- A mission statement that places shareholder value as the definition rather than the result of success is uninspiring. [811]
- Evolutionary Organizations aspire to eudaemonic purpose—missions that enable human flourishing. [820]
- A great purpose is aspirational, but it’s also a constraint. It focuses our energy and attention. [825]
- Done well, purpose unites us, orients us, and helps us make decisions as we go. [828]

### Thought Starters [829]

- Fractal Purpose. [830]
  - While we want to avoid bureaucratic alignment exercises, teams should have a coherent narrative about how their efforts serve the whole, even if they’re intentionally pursuing a divergent path. [831]
  - Even individual roles have a purpose that, if properly articulated, eliminates the need for lengthy job descriptions. [832]
- Steering Metrics. [835]
  - when we obsess over metrics, we fall victim to Goodhart’s law, which states that a measure that becomes a target ceases to be a good measure. [836]
  - Instead, we should think of metrics as guides for steering toward our purpose. [838]
  - You’re looking for quantitative and qualitative signals that will help you sense and respond. If you aren’t making decisions and taking action based on your metrics, you’re doing it wrong. [840]
- Proxy for Purpose. [844]
  - The truth is that our customers are a proxy for our purpose. They’re our partners in solving the tension between our virtuous intent and their actual needs. [848]

### Purpose in Action [852]

- Essential Intent. [853]
  - In Greg McKeown’s best-selling Essentialism, he put forth the breakthrough notion of an essential intent, a goal that sits between your ultimate vision and your quarterly objectives. He says that an essential intent “is both inspirational and concrete, both meaningful and measurable. Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions.” [854]
  - Ask every team in your organization to articulate their essential intent. What has to happen in the next six to twenty-four months to keep us moving toward the organization’s purpose? [862]
  - Resist the urge to make them all fit together perfectly. Instead, notice and discuss divergence and convergence. Offer everyone the chance to revise and refine their essential intents regularly, and keep them somewhere everyone can access them. [863]
- Six Months or Thirty Years. [865]
  - In 2012, around the time Facebook reached a billion users, it published a little red book for employees that contained a lot of the stories, principles, values, and folklore of the business, memorialized for the next generation. [866]
  - “There is no point in having a 5-year plan in this industry. With each step forward, the landscape you’re walking on changes. So we have a pretty good idea of where we want to be in six months, and where we want to be in 30 years. And every six months, we take another look at where we want to be in 30 years to plan out the next six months.” [868]
  - While OS change is anything but linear, we have found that other dimensions are often dependent on a clear and compelling purpose. [873]

### Questions on Purpose [876]

- What is our reason for being? What will be different if we succeed? Whom do we serve? Who is our customer or user? What is meaningful about our work? What measures will help us steer? How does our purpose help us make decisions? What are we unwilling to compromise in pursuit of our goals? Can our purpose change? If so, how? [879]

## AUTHORITY How we share power and make decisions; the right to make decisions and take action, or to compel others to do the same. [891]

- Over time, red tape builds up until hardly anything interesting can be done without three different approvals. Only very senior managers and people willing to lose their jobs are able to act freely. The rest of the workforce, unauthorized to solve their own problems, develops a sense of apathy and learned helplessness. [897]
- Evolutionary Organizations ensure that everyone has the freedom and autonomy to serve the organization’s purpose. The default assumption here is that you can do anything, unless a specific policy or agreement prohibits it. [908]
- This is made possible by new forms of decision making that leverage purpose, principles, consent, and advice to ensure that the choices being made are informed and sound. That means taking the time to define the decision rights held by each member, role, and team. Who can make a decision and how it should be made are critical components of your OS, and can’t be left to chance. [913]
- Every request for orders from the sailors under his command was met with “Well, what do you intend to do?” And at first they were unsure. No one had ever asked. But in time, they came prepared. [920]
- This is our addiction to control masquerading as “risk management.” What firms like this fail to recognize is that the true risk they face is that bureaucratic immobilization will make them irrelevant. [926]

### Thought Starters

- Freedom to Fail. [928]
  - The vast majority of leaders I meet believe that their job is to ensure perfect execution. [928]
  - By focusing on execution, we limit the potential for growth in the system. [931]
  - In complexity, our job isn’t perfection, it’s building a culture that is always learning. And that requires letting go. [932]
- Minimum Viable Policy. [936]
  - This is governing for the exception rather than the rule. At Basecamp, they institute a new policy only when something negative happens over and over again. Ask yourself, What’s the smallest amount of policy required to protect us while preserving the flexibility to learn and act with judgment? [939]
- Decision Discipline. [942]
  - There is a surprising inconsistency in Legacy Organizations: while they are extremely restrictive about who can make decisions, they are positively lackadaisical about how those decisions are made. [942]
  - This applies to how we define decision spaces, how we size decisions, whom we involve, how we decide, and how we evaluate the choices we’ve made. Take the time to find out more about decision science, so that when faced with a big decision you have a whole tool kit at your disposal. [945]

### Authority in Action [947]

- The Waterline. [948]
  - What sorts of decisions can everyone make without consulting others? How much authority are you willing to distribute with no strings attached? Make this explicit and push back when colleagues come to you for permission on something above the waterline. Ask them what they intend to do. [955]
- The Advice Process. [957]
  - In many Evolutionary Organizations, anyone can make a big decision, but first they must seek advice from colleagues who have experience with or will be affected by their choice. That means they seek them out, sit down with them, and talk through all the implications of the decision. [959]
  - For an advice process to work, the person making the decision must be humble enough to seek advice and really listen. And advisers must be comfortable with the idea that their counsel may or may not be heeded. [961]
  - This is advice, plain and simple. Once a decision has been made, it should be shared transparently along with the rationale and perspectives that shaped it, so that others can learn too. When it works, this process creates a sense of ownership and responsibility that is hard to replicate. [963]
- The Consent Process. [965]
  - His argument was that all policy decisions—agreements, rules, roles, structures, and resources—should be made through the informed consent of those impacted by them. [969]
  - Interestingly, in Sociocracy members may consent to using other methods of decision making, including distributing authority to specific roles, teams, or elected representatives, provided they consent to the method itself. [970]
  - Keep in mind, the creators of this process recommend using a facilitator to keep the group on track. [976]
- Integrative Decision Making Process [977]
  - Propose. [978]
  - Clarify. [980]
  - React. [982]
  - Adjust. [984]
  - Consent. [987]
  - Integrate. [990]
- Decision Stack. [992]
  - Everything above, from the waterline to the consent process, is about defining the decision rights in your organization. [992]
  - Gather everyone on your team together and dive in. Roles. Ask: What are the roles that we each hold? Try to think beyond job titles and go one layer deeper if you can. Create a roster of roles with basic descriptions in a shared space. Waterline. Ask: What decisions can any of us make without advice or permission? Generate as many answers as you can and then discuss them as a group. What do they have in common? What role do monetary risk and social risk play in defining what is safe? Record your observations and takeaways. Advice Process. Ask: When should we seek advice? Using the overview above, define an advice process that will work in your culture and context. Specify expectations for advice seekers and advice givers. Generate a list of the kinds of decisions you’d expect to see engaging the advice process. Consent Process. Ask: What decisions should be made only by consent? Identify decision spaces where the integration of multiple perspectives is crucial. Major changes to policy and structure are good places to start. Clarify whether you intend to use IDM or another consent process. Rights by Role. Ask: What decisions should be made exclusively by one of our roles? Identify decisions that should be entrusted to specific roles with expertise, experience, or other qualifications. Take the time to map these decision rights to your roles in a format that will be accessible and editable going forward. Optimize. Ask: Can we make this simpler? Reflect on your freshly minted decision stack and look for opportunities to increase the number and kinds of decisions that fit above your waterline or in your advice process. Finally, take a moment to gather consent for the whole proposal. When everyone agrees it’s safe to try, you’re ready to go. [994]

### Authority in Change [1011]

- The problem in most cultures isn’t a lack of evolutionary principles and practices. [1011]
- The problem is that they don’t spread. And they don’t spread because the vast majority of teams don’t feel they have ownership over their way of working. [1012]

## STRUCTURE How we organize and team; the anatomy of the organization; formal, informal, and value-creation networks. [1030]

### Thought Starters [1064]

- Three Structures. [1064]
  - Author and self-proclaimed “management exorcist” Niels Pflaeging has a transformative view of the inherent physics of organizations. [1065]
  - He claims every organization has three structures: The first is the formal structure, the realm of hierarchy, which exists purely for compliance with the law. [1066]
  - The second is the informal structure, the realm of influence. [1067]
  - And finally, the value-creation structure, the realm of reputation. [1069]
  - When we talk about organizing and teaming in new ways, about the inner workings of Evolutionary Organizations, it is their value-creation structure that we’re talking about. [1070]
- Centralize vs. Decentralize. [1074]
  - In a complex world, decentralization offers many benefits, but we need to maintain collective coherence. To achieve this, we can leverage transparency, social pressure, and principles. [1080]
  - And when centralization seems to make sense—as with some software platforms or shared data sources—I use one question to clarify my position: which structure will make us faster and more adaptive? [1082]
- Functions vs. Integration. [1084]
  - Unfortunately, centralized functions (as we currently conceive of them) are not compatible with complexity. [1085]
  - The alternative is functional integration. [1086]
- One to Many Roles. [1094]
  - Job titles mask the complexity of the roles we hold, and they limit our ability to shape them and step in and out of them freely. [1097]
  - Recognize that you already hold many roles in many places. Claim them. [1099]

### Structure in Action [1100]

- SLAM Teams. [1100]
  - S-L-A-M stands for self-managed, lean, audacious, and multidisciplinary. [1101]
- Dynamic Teaming. [1107]
  - The rules are simple: Teams have the authority to add or remove members using the consent process. Members have the ability to join or leave teams with reasonable notice. And members can manage their own bandwidth (i.e., hold more than one role). [1108]

### Structure in Change [1111]

- Because structure is often a proxy for power, managers (particularly middle managers) may be hesitant to do anything that threatens their position. [1112]
- The breakthrough happens when they realize that they can trade control for participation. Rather than living in one place in the org chart, they can live in many, a mix of roles where their influence is direct rather than indirect. Positional power traded for reputation. [1114]

## STRATEGY How we plan and prioritize; the process of identifying critical factors or challenges and the means to overcome them. [1133]

### Thought Starters [1179]

- Wild Swings and Sure Things. [1180]
  - Nassim Nicholas Taleb introduced an extremely valuable concept in his book The Black Swan called the barbell strategy. [1180]
  - invest 85–90 percent of your assets in extremely safe instruments, and place all of the remainder in highly speculative bets. [1182]
- Careful with OKRs. [1188]
  - There are two things to watch out for here. [1192]
  - The first is, again, Goodhart’s law. Once people set their OKRs, they’re going to do everything they can to hit them, including things that aren’t good for the business. [1192]
  - The second is that many firms try to use OKRs as a form of top-down control, ensuring that each subordinate’s OKRs fit with the OKRs of their superior. While this feels like alignment, it all but eliminates any chance of divergence or serendipity. [1195]
- Learn Faster. [1199]
  - In a truly dynamic marketplace, all winning strategies will have one thing in common: the desire to be faster. Or more specifically, to learn faster. [1199]
  - In talking about the OODA loop, Harry Hillaker (chief designer of the F-16) said, “Time is the dominant parameter. The pilot who goes through the OODA cycle in the shortest time prevails because his opponent is caught responding to situations that have already changed.” [1201]

### Strategy in Action [1209]

- Even Over Statements. [1210]
  - The problem with priorities is that we have too many. [1210]
  - The even over statement, which is a form of strategy, does a great job of indicating that even though we value the thing on the right, we value the thing on the left more. [1215]
  - Good strategy statements work in both directions—one good thing over another good thing. [1218]
  - the important thing is that they’re both plausible. That’s how he can be sure the trade-offs are real. [1220]
  - And remember, bad strategy statements contain trade-offs that don’t hurt, or ignore them altogether. Good ones make tough choices. [1234]
- Scenario Planning. [1236]
  - It’s fair to ask, Do we even need a plan? Yes, but not a plan that says what must happen, a plan that says what might happen. [1238]
  - Scenario planning has the potential to open us up to possibilities that we might otherwise not consider. [1239]
- Red Team. [1245]
  - Gather any group of colleagues and ask them to design the competitor that would bury you. [1250]
  - Their enthusiasm is proportional to the amount of org debt you’re carrying. [1251]

### Strategy in Change [1254]

- Instead, demote your annual operating plan. Make it an annual operating prediction. Let teams take ownership of their local expression of strategy and operations. [1258]

### Questions on Strategy [1260]

- What is our current strategy? How is our strategy informed by our purpose? What are the critical factors that will mean the difference between success and failure? What are the trade-offs we’re willing to make? How do we develop, refine, and refresh our strategy? How do we communicate our strategy? How do we use strategy to filter and steer day-to-day? How does our strategy inform our planning process? [1263]

## RESOURCES How we invest our time and money; the allocation of capital, effort, space, and other assets. [1276]

- Dr. Morlidge continues, “Revenue targets can act as a ceiling since there is no incentive to exceed them, whereas cost budgets become a floor as there is no motivation to spend less.” [1325]

### Thought Starters [1329]

- It’s All Relative. [1329]
  - Where a Legacy Organization might commit to a specific revenue-growth target for the year, Beyond Budgeting would recommend beating the average performance of their competitors. [1336]
  - The Beyond Budgeting folks believe that individual performance doesn’t really exist. Performance is a team sport. [1340]
- The “Tragedy” of the Commons. [1341]
  - Elinor Ostrom shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics for her research into how humans successfully (and unsuccessfully) manage the commons. What she found was that successful communities leverage something she calls polycentric governance. [1344]
  - In experimenting with rule combinations within the smaller-scale units of a polycentric system, citizens and officials have access to local knowledge, obtain rapid feedback from their own policy changes, and can learn from the experience of other parallel units.” [1348]
  - When teams have the right (and the inclination) to experiment with their own rules and norms, they can find ways to collaboratively leverage and preserve resources. [1350]

### Resources in Action [1353]

- Zero-Based Zephyr. [1354]
  - At Morning Star, business units present their plans for the upcoming year and colleagues invest in the ideas they like best using a virtual currency. [1355]
  - Now you face a choice: will you act on the wisdom of the crowd? [1366]
- Participatory Budgeting. [1367]
  - The application allows a team or community to propose, discuss, and fund new projects in a transparent and intuitive way. [1372]
  - To get a sense of how it works, invite your team to try something like Cobudget and put your discretionary budget for the next quarter on the line. [1374]

### Resources in Change [1376]

- The budgeting and planning process is one of the few practices that truly span the organization and, as such, requires a lot of consent to revolutionize. [1378]

### Questions on Resources [1381]

- How do we allocate funds, effort, space, and other assets? Are resources deployed annually, quarterly, or dynamically? Do we use targets, forecasts, trends, and/or tolerances? If so, how? How do strategy and planning influence resource allocation? How do we balance resources across the short term and long term? How do we balance resources across our core business and innovation? How do we define and measure the performance of our resources? How does our approach enable us to respond to emergent events? [1384]

## INNOVATION How we learn and evolve; the creation of something new; the evolution of what already exists. [1398]

- Paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth Vrba coined the term “exaptation” to describe the phenomenon of a biological trait being co-opted for another purpose beyond its initial advantage. Exaptation isn’t limited to biology, though; [1408]
- While a centralized innovation hub might be able to produce a few hits, it severely limits the likelihood of exaptation. And importantly, product innovation isn’t the only kind of innovation we need. [1417]

### Thought Starters [1422]

- Innovation Everywhere. [1422]
  - When teams are truly empowered, customer focused, and functionally integrated, it can be hard to say where “innovation” happens. [1426]
- Watch What Spreads. [1435]
  - If teams are truly free to try new things and adopt what works, innovation can become organic. Next time you hear a great idea or see a winning approach, don’t roll it out, offer it up. [1443]
- Biological Barbells. [1444]
  - When we have a sure thing on our hands, we should deploy most but certainly not all of our resources there. When we don’t know what’s going to work—in a startup or new division, for example—we need to increase exploration, randomness, and variation, even if it feels a little counterintuitive. [1451]

### Innovation in Action [1453]

- Defaults vs. Standards. [1454]
  - Standards tend to be enforced. [1455]
  - The problem with standards is that they undermine our ability to use judgment, innovate, and learn. [1457]
  - A default says: If you don’t know what you’re doing, do this. If you don’t have time to think, try it our way. But if you’ve achieved some level of mastery in an area and you think you see a better way, feel free. Let us all know how it goes, [1458]
  - Our members know they can take a risk and go their own way, but only when they think that we all stand to benefit. [1463]
- Twenty Percent Time. [1464]
  - You’ll have to model and support this practice with discipline and passion to realize its many benefits. [1470]
- The Lean Startup Method. [1471]
  - Developed by Eric Ries, the method proposes a feedback loop containing three stages: build, measure, and learn. [1475]
  - Instead of trusting your assumptions and barreling ahead, you’re going to identify them and ask one of the most powerful questions in innovation: how might we validate that? [1478]

### Innovation in Change [1479]

- The act of working on any dimension of your OS is an act of disruption and invention. So while you might not get around to talking about the system-wide approach to novelty right away, rest easy knowing that you’re working on it. [1483]
- A true culture of innovation is one where we can’t tell the difference between operations and invention. [1496]
- Accept that innovation is inherently uncertain. A healthy amount of variation and divergence is necessary if you want a vibrant ecology of self-renewal. Have the discipline to make bets in good times and bad. [1498]

## WORKFLOW How we divide and do the work; the path and process of value creation. [1501]

- Improving workflow, the way value is created, is a continual source of advantage for the firms that do it. They gain speed, quality, efficiency, and in many cases simplicity. [1508]
- “loosely coupled but tightly aligned.” This concept, previously introduced in the Netflix Culture Deck (an employee handbook on steroids), suggests that we maximize strategic alignment but minimize dependencies and red tape among teams. [1536]
- Early on, Spotify realized that if it treated its product as one monolithic application, the coordination required among teams would be too great. So the company cut it up and created the infrastructure to support a modular approach. [1539]

### Thought Starters [1544]

- Flow Interrupted. [1545]
  - choose a project that created real value for a customer. [1547]
  - Trace the line of who needed to be involved to create that value—by skills or by person, whichever is easier. Now compare that network with the org chart that represents where people sit day to day. [1548]
  - In an ideal state, your day-to-day value-creation structure—where people spend their time physically and virtually—and your workflow are one and the same. [1550]
- Nothing but Projects. [1552]
  - Indeed, treating everything as a project allows us to be more intentional—starting, stopping, and evolving activity with the same level of scrutiny. [1556]
  - Cleaning the bathroom as a task is disempowering. But the “clean bathrooms for our guests” project creates possibilities. [1559]

### Workflow in Action [1562]

- Working in Sprints. [1563]
  - consider running every project as a series of one- or two-week sprints. Think of a sprint as a unit of time during which you must produce and share a unit of work—a self-imposed deadline. [1564]
- Limit WIP. [1574]
  - Create a Kanban board with three columns: “To Do,” “Doing,” “Done.” [1578]
  - Now move the most critical and urgent projects over to the “Doing” column until you’ve reached your newly minted project threshold. [1579]
  - And remember, if a new request comes in that you agree to tackle, something else has to go back on pause. [1582]

### Workflow in Change [1584]

- They think in big chunks of polished work; we think in small chunks of raw output. [1586]
- Recognize that healthy workflow comes from organizing around the work, not working around the organization. [1601]
- Accept that workflow is something to be coordinated and refined, not something that can be solved. Ensure that every team has the capacity to do the work and improve how they do the work at the same time. [1604]

## MEETINGS How we convene and coordinate; the many ways members and teams come together. [1607]

- Like it or not, great meetings offer higher bandwidth—more information per second—than any other form of communication. [1635]

### Thought Starters [1641]

- Death to Status Updates. [1641]
- One-on-One Fun. [1650]
  - Great one-on-ones can provide feedback and mentorship, deepen relationships, or give us a chance to collaborate on the work. But if you notice they’re becoming a venue for other unmet needs, pull the rip cord and bring those conversations into the light. [1654]
- Governance. [1657]
  - One way to do this is to encourage every team to hold a monthly governance meeting. The goal of this meeting is for everyone to have the chance to voice their concerns and propose local changes to structure, strategy, resources . . . anything that will help the organization pursue its purpose. [1659]

### Meetings in Action [1664]

- Facilitators and Scribes. [1664]
  - One of the best ways to increase meeting effectiveness is to ensure that someone is responsible for the structure, flow, and output of every meeting. [1665]
  - To get started, try electing a facilitator and scribe in each of your recurring meetings. Give them the authority to design and hold the space for meaningful interactions. After ninety days or so, elect new players to fill those roles, until everyone has held that responsibility. [1670]
- Meeting Moratorium. [1673]
  - see if your team is open to canceling all meetings for two weeks. [1674]
  - discover the difference between what you have and what you really need. [1681]
- Retrospectives. [1682]
  - A retro is simply a chance for any team to stop, notice, and learn. [1683]
  - The goal is simple: to do better next time. [1685]
  - Many forms of retrospective exist, ranging from the simple (mapping highs and lows over the time line of the project) to the more complex (four Ls: liked, learned, lacked, longed for). [1685]
  - It’s up to you to make sure that your team looks back and takes the time to learn regularly. [1688]
  - It’s also important to make sure that retros are a place where participants can say what needs to be said. [1688]

### Meeting Moves. [1690]

- While most organizations would benefit from fewer meetings, many would also do well to employ a wider variety of meeting structures. [1690]
- Start meetings by checking in. [1695]
  - Beginning with a question allows us to connect on a human level. [1695]
  - Typical questions include: What’s on your mind? What are you looking forward to? What’s the biggest risk you’ve ever taken? [1696]
- Speak and participate in rounds. [1697]
  - When we want to prioritize speed and inclusion, we’ll go around the table and give everyone one chance [1697]
- Build an agenda on the fly. [1700]
  - Rather than predict what will matter most tomorrow or next week, we’ll choose and prioritize our topics once we get in the room. [1700]
  - If we don’t get to it, we don’t save it. Someone will bring it up next time if it’s still important. [1701]
  - If you’re hungry for more, liberatingstructures.com is a fantastic resource [1702]

### Meetings in Change [1705]

- Small changes here can lead to breakthroughs in transparency, trust, time savings, and speed that create momentum and space for other, bigger moves. [1707]
- rather than treating all meetings as social free-for-alls, let the purpose of every meeting dictate its structure. [1720]
- Accept that coordination and shared consciousness in a complex system require high-bandwidth forums for information sharing, including meetings. [1723]

## INFORMATION How we share and use data; the flow of data, insight, and knowledge across the organization. [1726]

- We had to change from ‘Who needs to know?’ to . . . ‘Who doesn’t know?’ and we need to tell them, and tell them as quickly as we can.” [1737]
- Within most Legacy Organizations, information is power. [1749]
- Information is guarded and shared on a case-by-case basis. This perpetuates the power structure and creates opacity that allows bias and misinformation to thrive. [1750]
- Data is not information. Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is not mastery. Mastery is not wisdom. [1759]

### Thought Starters [1764]

- Transparency. [1764]
  - insight can come from anywhere, but only if information reaches the right person at the right time. Because we can’t predict when that will be, we have to aspire to what economists refer to as information symmetry—a condition in which all relevant information is known to all participants. [1766]
- Push vs. Pull. [1778]
  - Legacy information sharing is “push,” meaning that the information is delivered to us without our consent. [1782]
  - But when information is abundant, a “pull”-based system where information is tagged, stored, and ready to search is far superior. [1784]
- Working in Public. [1789]
  - When a culture is risk averse and teams lack the authority to make decisions about their work, a funny thing happens to work in progress. It goes underground. [1790]
  - So we end up with cultures where everything has to be perfect before it’s shared. This [1792]
- Organizational Git. [1800]
  - imagine taking a similar approach to all the information, knowledge, and products in your organization. [1807]
  - Several organizations, including Enspiral, Crisp, GitLab, and my own, have started to host their organizational “code” online. We use a service called GitBook that makes it easy and accessible. Will you join us? [1811]

### Information in Action [1813]

- Kill Email. [1814]
  - It has three fatal flaws. [1818]
  - First, email defaults to privacy rather than transparency. [1818]
  - Second, email is an information sinkhole. [1820]
  - And finally, email is context free. Every email, regardless of whom it came from or how important it is, lands in your inbox in the exact same way. [1822]
  - That’s where messaging apps like Slack come in. [1825]
  - You can still have a private conversation, or even a private channel, but that’s a choice, and you have to ask yourself, Am I sure no one else would benefit from this discussion? [1828]
- Multiplayer Software. [1833]
  - Apps such as Google’s G Suite, Office 365, Dropbox Paper, Box Notes, Quip, Trello, Evernote, Basecamp, Asana, and Parabol allow multiple users to create and edit documents, files, and data simultaneously. [1835]
  - Instead of information flying from inbox to inbox, everyone shares a single source of truth that is always one click away. [1837]
- Ask Me Anything. [1842]
  - One powerful way to break patterns of secrecy and rumor is to host a regular Ask Me Anything session with your function, division, or organization. [1842]
  - Traditional AMAs often look to leaders for answers, but I’ve found that opening up the floor so that anyone can answer supports the idea that the best information is distributed. [1852]

### Information in Change [1855]

- Increased transparency is critical in the early stages of transforming your OS, because it’s a prerequisite for making sound decisions. [1855]
- Avoid this by focusing on sharing early and often. Make it safe. Make it habitual. [1859]
- Sharing leads to reciprocity, responsibility, and learning. Secrecy leads to distrust and suspicion. [1871]
- Accept that no one knows what information will prove to be critical, or in which hands information might change everything. More and better information, and more and better ways to make sense of it, is the source of competitive advantage in complexity. [1872]

## MEMBERSHIP How we define and cultivate relationships; the boundaries and conditions for entering, inhabiting, and leaving teams and organizations. [1875]

- When it comes to membership, it’s helpful to think of an organization as a set of membranes—cells within cells within cells. Each membrane, or team boundary, is made up of requirements and agreements, both spoken and unspoken. Honor them and you’re in. Dishonor them, and you’re out. [1892]
- membership isn’t binary. Not every employee feels the same level of loyalty, or inclusion, or participation. No, membership is really a social status. It’s an identity. It’s a living agreement. [1898]
- What matters is that we are intentional. [1900]
- in a complex system, the interactions matter more than the parts. [1904]

### Thought Starters [1914]

- In or Out. [1914]
  - In the vast majority of cases, if your boss fires you from your role, you’re also fired from your company. [1915]
  - But if we view the organization as a living system and our people as multidimensional participants, then we can uncouple membership in teams from membership in the company. A member can hold one role, hold many roles, go find an open role, or even create a role. [1919]
- Teams Rule. [1924]
  - If you accept that each individual in your organization should choose their projects and their colleagues, something interesting happens. Teams become sovereign spaces and microenterprises. [1927]
- Careful with Culture Fit. [1933]
  - While hiring for culture fit (even over skills or star potential) is a predictor of success early in a firm’s history, later on it actually causes firms to underperform. [1934]
  - Instead of fit, IDEO hires for cultural contribution. It asks, What’s missing from our culture? [1936]
- Ritual. [1942]
  - Rituals help us mark important thresholds and changes in our lives, in ways large and small. [1942]
  - Research shows that rituals can reduce anxiety or increase confidence and even help us assume contextual identities (think: soldier or firefighter). [1945]
  - We practice a wide variety of rituals at The Ready, but one of my favorites is how we recognize team members who are leaving the firm for a new chapter in their career. [1948]
- No Handcuffs. [1952]
  - When you view the world as a zero-sum game in which there can be only a finite number of winners, you tend to view competition as something you want to eliminate. [1952]
  - Holding someone hostage does not create peak performance. It creates resentment and disengagement. [1957]
  - What if you didn’t have these tools at your disposal? [1957]
  - My guess is you’d focus on creating a workplace that people don’t want to leave. [1958]

### Membership in Action [1965]

- Team Charter. [1965]
  - A team charter forces the team to answer critical questions about why it exists and how its members want to show up for one another. [1969]
- User Manual to Me. [1989]
  - The idea is genius: what if we each wrote a user manual about how to work with us and shared it with our teams? [1991]
- Gratitude. [2007]
  - One of the simplest ways to improve relationships within your community or team is to show appreciation for one another. [2008]
  - Here’s an easy way to get started: At the beginning or end of your next meeting, ask everyone to stop what they’re doing and think for a moment about something or someone they’re grateful for and wish to recognize within the team. Then go around one by one and share. [2009]

### Membership in Change [2015]

- One of the most important steps The Ready takes in coaching teams through transformation is to define the boundary around who is actively working in new ways. [2015]
- we focus on inviting (rather than forcing) people [2017]
- We’re telling them, if you step into this space, you’re committing to try new things. [2018]
- Recognize that everyone needs to feel a sense of belonging, both within the organization and within their team(s). [2030]
- Celebrate generative difference and make space for people to bring their whole selves to work. [2032]
- Accept that a vibrant membership of commitment and participation is a prerequisite for self-organization. [2034]

## MASTERY How we grow and mature; the journey of self-discovery and development; our approach to nurturing talent, skills, and competence. [2038]

- Talent and skills don’t matter if we don’t have the maturity—the courage and humility—to welcome the conditions for continuous growth. And our ability to do this has a lot to do with what psychologists call the four dimensions of core self-evaluation: locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. [2076]

### Thought Starters [2092]

- Maturity Model Madness. [2092]
  - These models promote conformity to dogma and reductive criteria that can quickly become the focus instead of actual competence. [2098]
  - Luckily, it’s easy to abandon the exhausting administration of these models for deliberate practice and knowledge transfer between masters and apprentices. [2100]
- Learn by Doing. [2103]
  - Dave Snowden, [2111]
  - spent decades thinking about knowledge management and ten years ago shared seven principles [2111]
  - Knowledge can only be volunteered; it cannot be conscripted. We only know what we know when we need to know it. In the context of real need, few people will withhold their knowledge. Everything is fragmented. Tolerated failure imprints learning better than success. The way we know things is not the way we report we know things. We always know more than we can say, and we will always say more than we can write down. [2113]
  - Consider the case of Etsy, the online marketplace that hosts an internal Etsy School where the curriculum is taught by and attended by employees. [2124]

### Mastery in Action [2127]

- Role Mix. [2127]
  - To make this real for your team, start by asking everyone to articulate the role(s) they’re already playing—including the role name(s), purpose(s), and general accountabilities. [2134]
  - Have everyone evaluate which roles they want to continue to play and which ones they’re ready to hand off. [2135]
  - Next, give your team the responsibility to create, modify, and remove roles going forward. [2136]
  - From here on out, every team member will be responsible for their own role mix, and every team for the roles within it. [2137]
- Ritual Feedback. [2140]
  - Here’s an approach to balancing both that puts the person seeking feedback in control: [2150]
  - Set a time frame for deeper feedback that makes sense in your context. I recommend 120 days. [2151]
  - On that interval, using software (e.g. Slackbot or Google Forms) or a team willing to facilitate, reach out to each member of your team, and ask them if they’d like feedback. If they say no, let it go. They’ll get another chance in a few months. [2152]
  - If they say yes, ask them whether they’d like to use standard questions (start/stop/continue or similar) or write their own. [2154]
  - Ask participants which three to five colleagues they’d like to receive feedback from. If you’re using software to automate this process, you may even be able to recommend the people they communicate with most frequently. [2156]
  - Send the questions to their suggested colleagues with a time limit for contribution. Make this a ritual that is prioritized and celebrated in the culture. [2158]
  - Compile and share the responses with each participant. Let them choose who to share it with, including their manager (if they have one). [2159]
  - Invite participants to convene their respondents for an in-person sensemaking session led by them. The question on the table is “Based on the feedback you received, what questions do you have for your colleagues?” This is chance to zero in on things that they want to work on and make real breakthroughs and commitments. [2161]
  - Finally, don’t let this feedback rhythm become an excuse to avoid real-time conversations and retrospectives. [2164]
- Communities of Practice. [2167]
  - members who share a common practice or interest should get together regularly with the express purpose of sharing and learning from one another. [2170]
  - Encourage the organic formation and stewardship of communities of practice or interest. [2172]

### Mastery in Change [2179]

- One practice leads to another, and we build mastery through repetition. Start where you are, not where you want to be. [2183]
- Remember that reverence for expertise can lead to arrested development or missed opportunities. Learning agility is a far better bet. [2198]

## COMPENSATION How we pay and provide; the wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, perquisites, profits, and equity exchanged for participation in the organization. [2201]

- In 1959 psychologist Frederick Herzberg proposed an answer to that very question in what would come to be known as his two-factor theory. [2221]
- Motivators included job characteristics such as recognition for achievement, meaningful and interesting work, involvement in decision making, and advancement or personal growth. Addressing these factors increased satisfaction by improving the nature of the work itself. [2223]
- Hygiene factors, on the other hand, included company policies, job status and security, supervisory practices, and—you guessed it—salary and benefits. Addressing these factors reduced dissatisfaction by improving the job environment. [2225]

### Thought Starters [2237]

- Parity Problems. [2238]
  - Any organization seeking to provide equal pay or equal opportunity today is facing a challenge more to do with privilege than with pay scale. [2246]
- Formulaic Pay. [2248]
  - By visiting their websites and entering a few variables such as the role you’re considering, your level of experience, and your location, you can calculate the salary you’d earn if you worked there. [2249]
- Market Pay. [2259]
  - Paying top of market is great, but in many cases it’s still dependent on a manager interpreting someone’s value from their singular perspective. Unconscious bias and favoritism are bound to creep in. [2267]
- Self-set Pay. [2269]
  - If formulaic pay is too reductive and market-based pay is too preferential, what’s left? [2269]
  - The transparency around compensation is sufficient for most people to make sound decisions that can withstand the scrutiny of their peers. [2277]
- Gig Economy. [2281]
  - If we move toward an economy where everyone is paid “by the drink,” we run the risk of eliminating good corporate citizenship. [2291]

### Compensation in Action [2294]

- Transparent Compensation. [2294]
  - The main by-product of this secrecy is “information asymmetry,” which is what happens when one party in a negotiation has more information than the other. [2298]
  - This can result in a wide range of salaries for the same role, known as wage dispersion, both within firms and across industries. [2300]
  - Some studies have even shown that environments with transparent pay are measurably more productive. [2308]
- Eliminate Bonuses. [2326]
  - Incentive compensation is counterproductive. [2326]
  - To make matters worse, individual performance is a myth. [2328]
  - But being a great player is not the same as winning the championship. [2330]
  - you really want to reward your team for business performance, do it in the form of profit sharing proportional to their percentage of the salary pool. That metric is harder to game, and it brings everyone together. [2333]

### Compensation in Change [2335]

- Those who benefit disproportionately from the status quo may be hesitant to be exposed, either out of guilt or for fear of corrective measures. Those at a disadvantage may not even know, but confronting the facts may make them feel undervalued or underappreciated. [2337]
- While not always possible, it can be helpful to provide some downside risk protection for everyone, such as “while we adopt pay transparency and new approaches to compensation, no one will cut your pay without your consent.” [2339]
- Keep the focus on autonomy, mastery, and purpose—conditions that actually support motivation. If you can, move to profit sharing (or a similar construct) to connect everyone to the overall success of the organization. [2352]
- Only transparency, dialogue, and judgment can make sense of what is fair, and even then you’ll be grappling with inherent issues of bias and privilege that will not be easily eliminated. Compensation can’t be solved, it must be tuned. [2355]

## USING THE OS CANVAS [2357]

- Like many tools, the canvas can be leveraged in a variety of different ways. [2359]
- For our part, we most often use it as a sensemaking tool—to map stories, tensions, and experiments that are happening in the wild—asking the teams themselves to interpret what’s going on. [2362]
- The canvas can provoke that conversation, and that conversation can provoke a change. [2365]

## READY OR NOT [2366]

- All decisions involve emotion. [2367]
- From here on out, I’m speaking to the believers. The catalysts. The visionaries. The risk takers. The readers who know in their gut that if we don’t change how we come together as human beings to build and shape the future, then the future won’t be a place we want to be. [2373]

## THE CHANGE [2379]

### THE CULTURE CONUNDRUM [2394]

- Author Seth Godin defines it as the story we tell ourselves. [2398]
- Culture can’t be controlled or designed. It emerges. It isn’t happening to people; it’s happening among people. [2401]
- So, if we can’t change culture and we can’t change people, what can we do? We can change the system. [2413]
- Control Inc. [2415]
- “Well,” I said, “this is the real work. We’re asking teams what’s slowing them down or standing in their way. We’re asking them what they’d change if they could. And we’re inviting them to design and run experiments around those tensions and scale the ones that work.” [2418]
- “Right . . . but what’s the plan?” [2421]
- We made the case that what Control Inc. needed was bigger than Agile and more nuanced than a reorg. It needed to evolve its operating system. [2427]
- We wanted access and volunteers; they wanted a plan. [2431]
- “We’re going to keep inviting teams to take ownership of their way of working. If they’re not the ones naming the problems holding them back, and they’re not the ones suggesting solutions, then you’re not evolving your operating system. [2438]
- “You want a destination, but what we’re actually doing is starting a pattern of continuous improvement—a habit of getting better every day. [2443]
- Emergent Inc. [2448]
- But we didn’t just talk; we experienced new ways of working through activities and exercises designed to challenge assumptions, and we talked about what we noticed. [2456]
- “Well,” I replied, “the things we’re doing now reflect what the teams are ready to do—what they identified as holding them back. As they master these things, they’ll naturally gravitate toward bigger systemic opportunities. [2462]

### THE FOLLY OF THE CHANGE PLAN [2475]

- Because we are oriented around a specific vision of the future, we tend to view change as finite. It’s a journey from point A to point B, with a beginning, middle, and end. [2477]
- This is a compelling but ultimately incoherent theory of change. [2480]
- The most prevalent change framework we encounter, and there are dozens, is almost certainly John Kotter’s eight-step process, from his 1996 best-selling book Leading Change. [2483]
- In the decades that have followed, these steps have become a kind of change dogma, wielded from the top by executives and consultants who do them to (rather than with) their organizations. [2487]
- Kotter himself updated the process in 2014, acknowledging that the steps should really be done concurrently and continuously. [2489]
- The problem is that we mistake the organization for an ordered system. And so we oversimplify. [2492]
- This plan-driven approach leaves little room for adapting as we go. [2496]
- The truth is that in an increasingly complex world, plans are lies committed to paper. [2500]

### CHANGING HOW WE CHANGE [2508]

- How do you change a complex adaptive system? You live in the now. [2511]
- The history of human innovation is a story of happy accidents. [2520]
- As leaders, we have been told we have to imagine a compelling future and drive everyone toward it. While this can gather people to our cause, it doesn’t do much to further it. [2522]
- What he’s getting at is the difference between closing the gap—trying to achieve a predetermined future state—and discovering what author Steven Johnson calls the adjacent possible. [2526]
- In the common tongue it might read something like this: we try new things, notice positive and negative patterns, amplify what’s working, and minimize what isn’t. [2534]
- What is counterintuitive about this approach is that it has the potential to go much faster than the traditional one. [2537]
- At this point you might be realizing, Oh shit, we’re not just changing the organization; we’re changing how we change the organization. [2543]
- We have a name for what happens when everyone in an organization is engaged and empowered to shape and reshape its operating system. We call it continuous participatory change. [2558]
- We can distribute authority and encourage everyone to steer the organization in service of its purpose. [2561]

### CONTINUOUS PARTICIPATORY CHANGE [2564]

- But if we stop looking for a proven process and start looking for patterns, we can find ways to make change an everyday occurrence. [2587]
- In our work, we’ve noticed six such patterns that, held lightly, are worth encouraging: [2589]
  - Commitment: When those with power or influence commit to moving beyond bureaucracy. [2590]
  - Boundaries: When a liminal space is created and protected. [2592]
  - Priming: When the invitation to think and work differently is offered. [2593]
  - Looping: When change is decentralized and self-management begins. [2594]
  - Criticality: When the system has tipped and there’s no going back. [2596]
  - Continuity: When continuous participatory change is a way of life, and the organization is contributing to the broader community of practice. [2597]
- Do not mistake these for steps. They’re more akin to thresholds. The order can change. They can be revisited and renewed. They can interact. But when they happen, they help. [2599]

- Commitment [2602]
  - In order to maximize our chances of success, the people in power have to commit to a few basic principles—simple rules for the elaborate ballet of continuous participatory change. [2615]
  - Autonomy. All members and teams should be self-managing and self-organizing. Members have the freedom and responsibility to use their skills, judgment, and feedback loops to steer and serve the organization’s purpose. [2619]
  - Consent. All policy decisions—agreements, rules, roles, structures, and resources—should be made through the informed consent of those impacted by that decision. In the spirit of agility, members may consent to using other forms of decision making, including distributing authority to specific roles, teams, or elected representatives. [2621]
  - Transparency. All information should be made available and accessible to all members. Individuals and teams should “default to open” when it comes to sharing data, information, knowledge, and insights. [2624]
  - Once you have the commitment of the people who hold power, you need to find other catalysts—to challenge you, encourage you, and learn alongside you. [2626]
  - The team you’re forming is the seed of a community of practice that will eventually include everyone. [2629]
- Boundaries [2638]
  - OS transformation needs liminal space to survive. We need a place in the organization where we can say: here we’re going to do things differently, here it is safe to try. [2655]
  - When working with clients, we tend to start with a boundary around a team, then two or three, and then what General Stanley McChrystal calls a “team of teams”—a network of teams bound by a common purpose. [2659]
  - Ultimately it is incumbent upon us to identify a liminal space and ensure that everyone inside it is a volunteer who feels a sense of safety and autonomy in the adventure ahead. [2664]
- Priming [2666]
  - Instead of diagnosis, we typically proceed with a process of experiential learning and dialogue we call priming. [2678]
  - The idea behind priming is to pull people out of their patterns and back onto a learning edge through play, reflection, and debate. [2683]
  - We maintain a tool kit of exercises designed to help us create these moments of epiphany. [2685]
  - One of our favorites is a game called Ballpoint. Originally created by Boris Gloger to deliver lessons about workflow, we use it today with executive teams around the world to help them experience self-organization. [2685]
  - Suffice it to say that many of the things they needed to realize about their OS were laid bare in just forty-five minutes of play and discussion. We finished by comparing how they played as a team with how they worked day to day. [2701]
  - Then I offered my final provocation: “You do realize that you just had more fun removing and replacing ping-pong balls from a bucket than you do on a regular day at work.” They laughed. “How we work matters, doesn’t it?” [2703]
  - Enemy/Defender, an improv game, shows us how simple rules can create complex behavior. [2705]
  - The Marshmallow Challenge highlights the importance of testing and learning. [2706]
  - The Cynefin Lego Game illustrates, in a hands-on way, the difference between simple, complicated, and complex systems. [2706]
  - An Identity Walk can shine a light on diversity and privilege in a way that cuts deeper than any presentation on inclusion or unconscious bias. [2707]
  - Typical topics we like to prime include complexity, emergence, self-organization, organizational debt, agility, leanness, motivation, self-awareness, mastery, trust, generative difference, psychological safety, and more. It’s the twenty-first-century curriculum that’s never taught in business school. [2709]
  - At the end of every priming experience, you’re extending an invitation, not a mandate: Join us. [2716]
  - Try something. Start a conversation. Ask for help. We are here for you. A whole new way of working is possible. Step into the space. [2717]
- Looping [2718]
  - inspired in part by Jason Little’s Lean Change Management. In our work, a loop contains three stages that are practiced recursively: Sensing Tensions, Proposing Practices, and Conducting Experiments. [2719]
  - While we’re often asked to teach clients new ways to decide, coordinate, and grow, the only thing they really need to know is how to loop. If you can loop you can learn, and if you can learn you’ll figure out the rest. [2725]
  - 1. Sensing Tensions [2727]
  - In Senge’s view, creative tension must be resolved by either pulling reality toward the vision (change) or pulling your vision toward reality (compromise). [2731]
  - Simply living with tension is unproductive. [2733]
  - Holacracy. In his book, founder Brian Robertson talks about tension as a signal that can guide us. “When we feel that sense of frustration at a system that’s not working, or a mistake that keeps getting repeated, or a process that seems inefficient and cumbersome, we are tuning in to a gap between how things are and how they could be.” [2736]
  - Working with teams around the world, we hear about their tensions every day. In fact, we ask for them. “What’s stopping you from doing the best work of your life?” is the first question we ask at the outset of any loop. “What’s stopping the organization from achieving its purpose?” is another. [2742]
  - For a team to start looping, they simply have to notice and name a tension. But this can be harder than it sounds. [2835]
  - To make things easier, we have developed a deck of cards featuring the most common tensions that helps teams push beyond these points of resistance. [2837]
  - When working with a team, we’ll hand them a deck containing all seventy-eight tensions and challenge them to narrow it down to just seven. [2839]
  - 2. Proposing Practices [2854]
  - In some ways, this is the hardest part of the process. [2854]
  - Having never before considered new ways to make decisions, for example, how can teams be expected to suggest novel approaches on the fly? [2856]
  - One way to counter this is to look beyond our own walls—beyond our own industries. [2857]
  - While the outside world is vast, there are also benefits to becoming more knitted internally. One simple approach is to set up a #ways-of-working channel on your internal messaging app (if you have one) and start sharing and discussing links that highlight novel practice. [2860]
  - While sorting through the cards, someone is going to say, “Wait, what the heck is dynamic teaming?” And from that moment forward, the conversation has shifted from push to pull. [2972]
  - That said, the occasional push can be helpful. [2973]
  - They can train the mind and body even before we fully understand them. One such practice is the act of “checking in” to meetings with our colleagues. [2974]
  - Asking everyone to answer a check-in question such as “What has your attention?” or “What color is your mood right now?” provides two unexpected benefits. The first is that the team has time to get present in a ritualized way. Starting differently short-circuits old patterns and puts us in a headspace to behave differently throughout. But more important, checking in by hearing from everyone sets a precedent of equity of voice that is sorely missing in most teams. [2976]
  - And finally, sometimes the best practice is no practice. In heavily bureaucratic systems, often the smartest thing you can do is remove obstacles. [2987]
  - Strip the system down to a few simple rules with a healthy boundary, and you’ll be amazed at what emerges (often exactly what is needed). [2989]
  - At this stage of the loop, every team must identify not just a range of potential practices but what they themselves are willing to try. The hurdle here is about commitment. [2991]
  - 3. Conducting Experiments [3000]
  - Our goal isn’t to make something work; it’s to learn, to see what’s possible—what emerges. [3002]
  - Experiment Worksheet [3008]
  - Tension What is your tension? How does it manifest? Share a story that brings it to life. [3009]
  - Practice What do you propose we try? What is your hypothesis? How does this practice support our commitment to a People Positive and Complexity Conscious OS? [3010]
  - Participants Who will be involved? What are they committing to? [3012]
  - Duration How long will the experiment last? When will you conduct a retrospective to collect perspectives and learning? [3013]
  - Learning Metrics How will we know if it was beneficial or harmful? What kinds of stories do you hope to hear? [3014]
  - Requirements What do you need in order to conduct the experiment, in terms of resources, space, supplies, funding, etc.? [3016]
  - Safety What kind of support or consent do you need to make this safe to try? [3017]
  - With these answers in hand, an individual or team can propose their test and seek consent. [3019]
  - The task is to introduce or remove the practice clearly (and often repeatedly) and notice what happens. [3025]
  - Your ability to be successful in any loop is directly linked to the degree to which participants are committed to trying. However, after reasonable exposure, be careful about forcing additional practice. [3028]
  - There is one very real challenge around looping that I want to make you aware of. Operating systems are interdependent and self-reinforcing. That means that an isolated experiment might not work. [3033]
  - What this means is that we have to adjust our expectations to match our context and commitment. [3038]
  - Sometimes we have to change small things now in order to change big things later. [3041]
  - Get as many repetitions under your belt as you can. Think of looping as something you have to master through deliberate practice. Start small. Start local. Be patient. And stick with it. [3042]
- Criticality [3046]
  - With a wink to that concept, we use the term criticality to refer to the moment in an OS transformation where enough people are sufficiently committed to the ideals of self-management that going back to the way things were is impractical. [3058]
  - What are the signs of criticality? There are many. Two that stand out are language and spread. [3067]
  - If you see the language changing at scale, that signals criticality. Because language is how we make meaning. [3072]
  - The second and perhaps more powerful sign is what we refer to as spread. This is what happens when the practices you’re introducing travel beyond the boundary you’ve set. [3073]
- Continuity [3078]
  - While we often refer to organizations at this stage as self-sufficient, that doesn’t mean teams don’t need help from time to time. In fact, at this point we encourage teams to build that help into their structure. [3081]
  - In these and other cases, teams that are struggling have the ability to engage a coach (rather than a boss) to get unstuck. [3083]
  - During the looping process we start identifying team members who are especially passionate about the practices and principles we’re exploring, and we invite them to become part of a coaching network within the organization. [3085]
  - We’ll gather this group on a regular basis for training and reflection and encourage them to become a resource to their team and the teams around them. Over time these roles may become informal and reputational, or they may become a career path, as in the cases above. [3087]
  - That’s why a community of practice is emerging among self-managed and agile organizations. They tend to share more about what they are doing, how it’s going, and what they’re learning. And they tend to be curious about how others are resolving the same tensions. [3094]

### PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY [3099]

- One of the reasons we don’t like to get into the “soft stuff” is that it makes us feel vulnerable. [3107]
- Unfortunately, cultures that don’t value and nurture openness and connection become dysfunctional and eventually toxic. [3112]
- In 2012, a team within Google launched an initiative called Project Aristotle. [3120]
- while effective teams were different in countless ways, they all seemed to share two qualities. [3125]
- First, all the members of the team spent a roughly equal amount of time talking. The technical term for this is equality in distribution of conversational turn taking. [3125]
- Second, the members of the team displayed fairly good intuition about what the other members were feeling. This is referred to as high average social sensitivity. [3126]
- As we saw with Control Inc., if you’re living in a state of constant fear, you’re unlikely to take a risk on a new approach, break with protocol, speak your mind, or act outside the chain of command—all things we’re going to ask people to do in this process. [3138]
- At Emergent Inc. we decided to build some psychological safety right out of the gate, using a technique called ICBD. [3141]
- ICBD stands for Intentions, Concerns, Borders, and Dreams. It’s a conversational exercise created by Alex Jamieson and Bob Gower that boosts trust within a team by asking members to confide in one another. [3142]
- Of course, some people also choose to play it safe. [3147]
- But I couldn’t do the work for them. What I could do was model the vulnerability we’re looking for. [3148]
- After nearly ninety minutes of ICBD, I turned to the group and asked, “Who thinks we’re ready to do the real work now?” I paused. “And who thinks that was the real work?” [3156]
- Some things we can write down. And some things happen in the space between people. Everything is the work. [3159]

### THE ROLE OF THE LEADER [3160]

- OS transformation is about distributing power, and while you might want to do that with one grand gesture, it actually happens one interaction at a time. [3164]
- Your new job is to ensure that the conditions for change are in place, not just now but in perpetuity. While you won’t be doing as much “leading” in the traditional sense, you’ll be doing something far more rewarding. You’ll be creating and holding the space for change. [3172]
- Creating Space [3175]
- When you commit to changing your OS, you’re taking on the challenge of creating a liminal space. [3184]
- And as we’ve discussed, continuous participatory change requires a boundary in which everyone can feel both safety and disruption. That space could be as small as a cross-functional team or as large as an entire firm. [3185]
- Creating space means ensuring that everyone on the team is committed to taking risks together and supporting one another. [3187]
- As wonderful as your culture may be, it’s best to assume that some people in your organization don’t feel safe. [3188]
- Let people see risk taking and failure recognized and rewarded. Let them see empathy. Let them see inclusion. [3191]
- Creating space also means making time for change. Because most teams simply don’t have it. [3192]
- One of the most self-destructive tendencies within teams is to get so busy that we believe there’s no time to get better at how we work. [3196]
- In order to do the work of change, we need to make time for it, and we need to be supported in that process. [3200]
- You can create these opportunities for them, or you can empower them to create them for themselves. [3204]
- Either way, you’re going to have to hold the entire system (and its hunger for short-term results) at bay. [3205]
- Holding Space [3207]
- Once the space for change exists, your second task begins: holding it. [3207]
- But the hardest part about holding space for change is that you can’t fill it. [3209]
- Your new job is to ensure ever-growing capability—a culture that gets better and more resilient every day. And that won’t happen if you’re playing the hero. [3214]
- Holding space means making room for teams to figure things out for themselves—for failure, learning, and growth. [3215]
- Every time you give an order or an answer, you’re either wrong and preventing them from discovering something better, or you’re right and preventing them from learning. [3217]
- The duty to hold space never ends. You need to be sure, before you begin, that you’re willing to defend your way of working from all enemies, foreign and domestic. [3222]
- Creating and holding space is hard work. But here’s the good news. As your organization and OS mature, a growing number of people will join your movement and connect their calling to its purpose. [3231]
- The purpose and space you’ve made will become community owned. [3234]

### PRINCIPLES FOR CHANGE [3235]

- Instead we attempt to develop principles or heuristics—guidelines that prove useful in certain situations without being overly rigid or restrictive. [3237]
- Through Them, Not to Them [3240]
- Change, for most people in most organizations, is effectively an announcement: effective today, things are different. [3248]
- Instead we encourage participation and ownership from the earliest days of any transformation effort. [3250]
- Every member within the boundary we select has a seat at the table and the ability to know what is going on from day one. They are “looping without supervision.” [3251]
- Start Small [3255]
- Involve fewer people. Change one part of a process rather than the whole thing, or change it for one group but not another. You’ll be surprised how easy it is to scale something that has been validated and improved by the people who have to use it every day. [3264]
- Think systemically. Act locally. And let scale happen. [3269]
- Learn by Doing [3270]
- Instead encourage teams to experience and experiment with new ways of working rather than discussing and debating them. [3279]
- We do this for two reasons. First, the amount of data you have after you try something is infinitely more than the amount you have beforehand. And second, most changes to a way of working are, in fact, safe to try. [3281]
- Sense and Respond [3283]
- The typical mental model for leadership includes the notion that we must manifest success through sheer force of will. [3284]
- Instead we can choose to practice sensing. Sensing means noticing—with our heads and our hearts—what’s really going on. [3292]
- When we let go of our desire to shape everything and everyone and instead sense what is happening and what could happen, we are able to see the moves that will bring us closer to our goals, often in ways we can’t anticipate. [3297]
- Start by Stopping [3299]
- If there are too many inhibitive practices already in place, it can be overwhelming to add new or contradictory ones to the mix. There simply isn’t space. [3305]
- Instead, ask yourself, “What can we remove, take away, or stop doing?” [3306]
- The vast majority of rules and process are created because we don’t trust people to do the right thing. [3308]
- Join the Resistance [3313]
- People resist change. That’s what most of us believe. [3314]
- Instead of perpetuating this pattern, look at resistance as information. People are telling you something when they resist change. [3322]

### SCALING CHANGE [3326]

- The first thing to recognize is that priming and looping deep in the organization can lead to scale organically, but this rarely happens quickly or cleanly. [3348]
- In our work, we’ve noticed at least three positive patterns that emerge on the heels of grassroots priming and looping. [3352]
- Confidence. When people are allowed to take ownership over even a small part of their way of working in a safe space, they open up. [3354]
- Relief. It’s obvious but still powerful that when you save people time, decrease stress, increase performance, or make progress on inclusion, it’s noticeable—and measurable. [3359]
- Wonder. Winning experiments reveal new possibilities. Working in new ways opens the mind to what could be. [3363]
- With each loop, we take stock of the questions our colleagues are asking and meet them where they are. We know that good loops will lead to bigger and deeper questions. [3368]
- While that kind of progress can be exciting, starting in one function or P&L and hoping for the spontaneous adoption of new ways of working in the rest of the business is unrealistic. There are better ways to proceed if we are having success locally. [3379]
- One is to use that momentum to move upward from local success toward the top of the house, ideally spanning more than one function, department, or location. [3381]
- Teams with more power can accelerate things in a way no one else can by eliminating constraints and distributing the authority to change. [3384]
- For that reason, whenever possible, we start at the very top. Even if the boundary we set for the transformation isn’t firm-wide, having the support and curiosity of the top team makes everything go faster later on. [3388]
- “Rather than worry about how we scale this, let’s worry about what might stop these practices from spreading,” [3394]
- First, we would take the time to do some priming work with the senior leadership team. Now that we had some early signs of life, they needed to be invited to participate in, consent to, or object to what we were doing. [3396]
- Second, we had to create the conditions for sharing to occur. [3398]
- We decided to highlight emergent practices from across the org every month during all-hands meetings. [3400]
- While scaling a new way of working (and changing) can be daunting, don’t allow yourself to be too overwhelmed by it. Criticality is fractal—tipping points can occur at any scale. [3402]

## Epilogue WHAT DREAMS MAY COME [3406]

- Somehow we have to reconcile that twentieth-century bureaucracy and capitalism got us here, but they won’t get us where we need to go unless they (and we) evolve. [3417]
- Purpose and human flourishing are the objectives that drive organizations. Growth is a result, not a goal. [3424]
- Innovation and experimentation are far more pervasive and distributed. It’s not uncommon to encounter a trial or test, even in well-optimized environments. [3437]
- Regulation is more Complexity Conscious—driven less by rules and compliance and more by experimentation and outcomes. Instead of “What fuel efficiency target must all automobiles meet by 2020,” the question might be “What conditions or enabling constraints lead auto manufacturers to increase fuel efficiency continuously?” [3442]
- The message has been clear for decades. We have to move from a model of eternal consumption (a chart that goes up and to the right forever) to a model that is regenerative and distributive. [3482]

### Building Blocks [3487]

- Building and sustaining an Evolutionary Organization is an uphill battle when the economic OS is structured to promote growth and gains over purpose and meaning. [3491]
- New Forms of Incorporation [3495]
- While public benefit corporations represent a legal innovation, Certified B Corporations represent an operational one. [3510]
- Not just what an organization values, but what it does. To become a Certified B Corporation, an organization must take the B Impact Assessment, which measures impact areas such as governance, workers, community, and environment, from the perspective of both operations and the underlying business model. [3512]
- Co-ops generally embody a set of ideals known as the Rochdale Principles: (1) voluntary and open membership, (2) democratic member control, (3) economic participation by members, (4) autonomy and independence, (5) education, training, and information, (6) cooperation among cooperatives, and (7) concern for community. [3520]
- And what if your mission is to create an organization that isn’t incorporated or centralized at all? That ambition is at the heart of an emerging class of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which leverage blockchain and cryptocurrencies to create products and services without central control. [3527]
- New Forms of Investment [3540]
- Every company that takes on traditional investment is (often unwittingly) promising to grow forever in exchange for capital now. [3542]
- Even firms that just borrow money are on the treadmill. [3549]
- Interestingly, at different points in the last century some economists have flirted with the idea of negative interest—a demurrage charge—as a way to encourage the flow of money in society. [3551]
- When the same dollar is spent ten times in a community rather than just once, prosperity follows. [3556]
- impact investing reflects a growing desire among investors to generate returns through investments that provide a public benefit. [3560]
- Venture capital is also experiencing an awakening. Firms such as Better Ventures, Impact Engine, and Notley Ventures are putting their money where their mouth is without compromising their ability to generate significant returns. [3566]
- While not explicitly focused on social impact per se, Indie.vc is attacking the venture capital model itself. [3571]
- Instead of taking equity up front, it takes an equity option that converts into equity if, and only if, you raise money later on or get acquired. Otherwise Indie.vc is paid back through profit sharing, capped at three times its initial investment. [3573]
- When companies don’t go public, only elite investors get to enjoy the climb. Yet all that’s waiting for leadership on the other side of the IPO rainbow is the constant scrutiny and pressure of a bunch of spectators. [3582]
- Over the last five years he’s been quietly developing an alternative called the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE). [3586]
- First, shareholder voting power will be based on tenure. The longer you hold a stock, the more influence you’ll have. [3587]
- Second, the exchange will require that listed companies have specific ties between executive pay and long-term performance. [3588]
- And finally, additional disclosure requirements will increase transparency in both directions between shareholders and management. [3589]

### Just the Beginning [3595]

- These innovations are not solutions. They are the start of a renaissance in the form and function of organizations. [3595]
- Into the Great Wide Open [3599]
- Can everyone work this way? [3604]
- It requires emotional maturity and competence, both of which can be nurtured in anyone in the right environment. [3606]
- An old Henry Ford quote best sums up my feelings on this question: “Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right.” [3610]
- Will there be enough work for everyone? [3611]
- Even as complicated work goes away, there’s a whole world of complex work yet to be done. Researchers have concluded that nonroutine work—anything that does not conform to checklists and rules—is far less likely to be automated in the years to come. [3620]
- Technology cannot invent the future, because that is the domain of people. [3623]
- What about education? Do we have to change how we develop young minds in order to prepare for this new world of work? [3626]
- The values and structures present in education today are mirror images of the Legacy OS we’re trying to overthrow. [3628]
- Learning happens through lecture (instruction) rather than curiosity and experience. Subjects (functions) are isolated rather than integrated. [3631]
- The measure of mastery is a test (training and certification), not practice or the ability to deliver outcomes. [3633]
- What about cultures that still value hierarchy, compliance, or other legacy traits? Do entire countries and peoples have to change to be successful? Isn’t that colonialism? [3641]
- Ideas such as autonomy, inclusion, transparency, and radical candor are perceived very differently by different cultures. [3643]
- Rather, every culture has ingrained strengths and weaknesses when it comes to work. What is incumbent on every business leader, regardless of cultural context, is to ask, What about our way of working is serving us and what isn’t? [3648]
- If every organization is People Positive and Complexity Conscious, how will they differentiate themselves? [3651]
- We raise the bar by seeing what is possible. That’s why I think the answer to this question is that organizations will differentiate themselves by doing more. [3659]
- The point is this: what a good problem to have. [3661]
- The promise of capitalist competition, but with a new scoreboard. Instead of just one winner, everybody wins. [3662]
