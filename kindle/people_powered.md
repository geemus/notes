# People Powered: How Communities Can Supercharge Your Business, Brand, and Teams

* Community forms from groups of people united by a common interest. They succeed by connecting the mission of the community with the work of the members.
* People become community leaders by repeatedly doing great work, developing enormous amounts of respect, and therefore gaining the trust of the community to make decisions.
* Social capital isn't just generated by contributing, but by how you contribute.
* Community members are not subservient, think of them as potential mentors and leaders.
* Community buildig is a cultural challenge, not a technology one.

* Key Ingredients:
  * How to make it easy for people to contribute and producte value?
  * How to make it easy to contribute repeatedly and build social captial?
  * How to make people feel welcome and intrinsic to community while building a sense of belonging?

* Value & Opportunity
  * Customer and User Engagement
  * Awareness, Marketing, and Customer/User Success - can be amplifier to transmit brand to broader set of people
  * Education and Support - tap into natural urge to teach
  * Product and Technology Development - map skills to meaningful work delivery
  * Business Capabilities

* Strategy takes 3-6 months, building growth and participation takes a year, possibly longer.
* Balance committed strategy with ability to react and optimize.
* In addition to delivering value, community provides ways for a broader set of people to do meaningful work

* Create a community mission statement, then gather feedback and improve. You want everyone to see their reflection (how they move the needle) in the community mission.

* Engagement Models:
  * Consumers - place for people to congregate, have discussions, share ideas/opinions, showcase work they have created, and debate aspects of a shared interest. Merit based on reputation formed by showing up and taking part.
  * Champions - place for people to learn, grow, and help others. Generates support, content, relationships, and advocacy.
  * Collaborators - place for people to actively work together on shared projects. Need to provide open access, clear/simple peer-review, be open to changing collaborative workflow, and provide equal opportunity/playing field.

* Momentum builds momentum, we are attracted to things that add value to other humans. Great service/experience inspire us to invite others.
* Focus both on building meaningful value and driving consumption of it.

* Make building on your platform as simple as possible, and incentive developers to promote and raise awareness of their application and working with your platform.
* Treat internal communities as volunteer by nature, clearly differentiate between requirements and requests.

* Key Principles:
  * Start simple and build valuable assets
  * Have clear and objective leadership - needs to be clear, intentional, approachable, and objective.
  * Clear culture and expectations - need to define/remind of these values on a day-to-day basis. Possibly via something like a community promise/covenant. Influence is important to us, not just to validate our own work, but to build a sense of belonging in a group.
  * Focus on relationships, trust, and engagement - invest yourself in other people's success, be interested in their story, and treat them like equals.
  * Strive for and be reactive to insight
  * Be surprising

* It is important to be authentic. Build a collaborative environment where your community is empowered to do great work.
* Instead of making people jump through hoops to get work approved, get them to want to jump through hoops to help them, you, and the rest of the community be successful.

* If you are unclear about what value your audience wants, and how you can deliver it quickly and reliably, you risk a lot of work and failure.
* The foundation for a great community is the combination of a clear way to contribute value and a clear way to receive value.
* Put the success and value of your prospective members first. If you get this right, success will naturally flow.
* People are initially attracted to tangible value, but intangible value keeps them coming back for more.
* It should be clear how the company can drive value to community members, and vice versa.

* Common areas of value:
  * Meeting other (awesome) people
  * Interesting content that enriches their experience - both consuming and enjoying when others consume what they have produced
  * High-quality education and getting help
  * Skills development
  * Mentoring and coaching
  * Career experience and expertise
  * Fun

* What organizations are looking for from community efforts:
  * Customer and user growth
  * Better support for customers and/or users
  * Improved marketing and brand recognition
  * Technology/Product production and enhancement
  * Recruiting and services

* Balance executive needs with practical guidance for folks on the ground, delivering this work.

* To understand communities and how to build them, understand people and how they work. Three areas:
  * understand irrationality of human behavior, why we behave the way we do, and how we can harness key behavioral patterns to our advantage.
  * Decide who our audience is and design a set of audience personas that help us to shape our community around a realistic understanding of their needs and characteristics.
  * Finally, understand the group dynamics in a community so we can engage with our community members as effectively as possible.

* SCARF model of behavioral considerations by Dr. David Rock:
  * Status is important to us.
  * Certainty, and more specifically avoiding uncertainty, is important to our well-being.
  * Autonomy refers to the impact of choices on our lives. Put simply, choice is important to us.
  * Relatedness taps into the natural urge we have to form smaller tribse within a broader group of people. Breaking communities into smaller teams can be a powerful way to tap into this safety instinct and build a sense of team spirit, identity, and belonging.
  * Fairness is important, not just because we want to be treated fairly, but because unfair treatment elicits threat and/or disgust responses.

* Common personas:
  * Users - general consumers
  * Fans - want to meet other fans, have discussions, and debate
  * Support - help others solve problems
  * Content creators - produce content and material
  * Advocates - perform morketing, outreach, and promotion to raise awareness and get people interested and involved
  * Event organizers - produce and deliver events
  * Inner developers - engineering to benefit a shared project of the community
  * Outer developers - build application and services that run on a platform we operate

* Based on community mission/value statements, initially focus on 2-3 critical personas. For each persona, flesh out:
  * What capabilities should this persona have?
  * What experience should this persona have?
  * What motivates this persona?
  * What are the fears of this persona?
  * What rewards would be interesting to this persona?
  * Where do they currently spend their time?

* Community golden rules:
  * Your community members work for the community, not you you.
  * If you ask them to help, they often will. Generic calls may demonstrate limited results, but reaching out to individuals often works much better.
  * They thrive on personal validation and gratification.
  * They are not free labor for your company.
  * They are not sales leads.
  * They don't have the same information and context as you do.
  * They may share the same vision, but not the same approach.
  * Their commitment and organizational experience will vary.
  * The quiter ones are often your secret weapons.
  * They are your friends, and friends keep friends honest.

* Constructive criticism shows members care and is a sign of the sucsse of your community.

* Great experiences produce an appetite for value, set expectations, and get you there easily with gratifying results.
* Don't treat community and a loosely affiliated collection of content. Think of it as a carefully curated, chronological journey.

* Community Participation Framework (take care to apply distinctly to each persona)
  * Onboarding - take brand new person representing a persona and help them produce something of value - to both them and the community - as quickly and easily as possible
  * Engagement - help person settle in and support transition from casual to regular and finally core.
  * Incentivization - help people stay engaged, develop their experience, produce new skills, and stay motivated.

* Steps to onboarding:
  * Why participate? You need to sell your community to them.
  * Setup tools. Don't drown them; reassure with simple step-by-step guidance.
  * Build skills. Understand what skills members need and provide them guidance to pick them up quickly and easily.
  * Tangible engagement. Provide simple ways to connect your members with problems that need solving.
  * Solve problems. Aside from providing resources, reassure them that questions are welcome.
  * Tangible validation. Finally, when they have contributed something of value, celebrate it.

* Keys to onboarding:
  * Don't assume too much, but do assume impatience.
  * Start simple and iterate.
  * Every step should connect clearly to the next step.
  * Where possible, make steps measurable.
  * Test all on-ramps objectively.

* Ideally, every member would have a mentor, but this doesn't scale. So instead here are three options:
  * Provide ways to find new things to do and accomplish, so that community members can self direct to the right choices.
  * Facilitate peer support and guidance.
  * Incentivize/reward to keep people moving forward.

* For every 100 community members: ~70 casual, ~30 regular, ~1 core.
* We should strive to provide the self-direction, peer review, and incentivization to drive casual to regular and regular to core, even if not everyone will ultimately get to core they should have the support to do so if they want to.
* Goal with casual is to help them acclimatize and settle in.
* Goal with regulars is te build a habit. Takes ~66 days to form a habit, so work to keep them participating throughout that period.
* Ensure regulars are informed, equipped, and can participate without too much red tape.
* Find ways to incorporate regulars more and more into broader structure and strategy.
* Goal with core is to make them feel part of the leadership. Be vulnerable and ask for their help and guidance.

* Rules for measuring effectively:
  * Test Critical Dimensions (not in priority order):
    * Growth - How many people are joining? How is growth changing over time?
    * Retention - Of those that join, how many stick around and participate?
    * Community Engagement - How many people are collaborating together? Are they engaging and working together?
    * Company Engagement - How effectively are staff engaging with community?
    * Delivery - Is community delivering results with personas? Is community delivering value in campaigns and initiatives?
    * Attendance - How well attended are in-person events, online webinars, campaigns, and other initiatives?
    * Efficiency - How efficient are onboarding, collaboration process, conflict resolution, and other elements?
  * Measure Both Action and Validation - ie not just that someone posted, but that the post was good. Tracking action measures engagement/delivery, tracking validation mesaures quality of engagement. Track both when you can.
  * Focus on Yes or No - When asking if the measure was accomplished, there should be a clear answer (not maybe).
  * Limit What You Measure

* Defining Success - dimensions of success for casual/regular/core
  * Productive Participation:
    * Individual Value - What measurable value has this person delivered for themselves?
    * Community Value - What measurable value has this person brought to the community.
    * Peer Value - What measurable value has this person provided to help their fellow community members.
    * Leadership Value - What measurable value has this person ginen in providing leadership to the community.
  * Getting Shit Done
  * Organizational "Oomph"
* Build an environment of resources, education, strategy, and execution that:
  * brings in new skills
  * trains people in them
  * supports them as they apply those skills
* Take lessons learned from incubation and become intentional about them. Produce standards of practice, train people in them, and ask people to refine and evove them.

* Maturity Model - Areas of Expertise:
  * Strategy - how you convert your Community Value Proposition into a real, living, breathing community.
  * Management - how you facilitate and run your community.
  * Growth - how you build growth and participation in your community.
  * Engagement - how you engage with the community in a personal, predictable, and positive manner.
  * Leadership - how you lead and run the community.
  * Tooling - all the tools/infrastructure/etc that make your community run smoothly.
  * Metrics - how your measure your community and its health, as well as how you use this information to evolve strategy.
* Maturity Model - Review:
  * Review at end of each cycle.
  * Fully review strategy once a year.
  * Gather feedback from all layers of the organization.
  * Emphasize desire for critical feedback.
  * Integrate changes into Quarterly Delivery Plan.

* Culture Strategy
  * Understand Ten Culture Cores
  * Build Growth Strategy
  * Build Engagement Strategy
  * Observe, Hypothesize, Experiment
* Culture Cores
  * Be open. Always default to open where you can. Talk and write openly and freely, provide extra context, and overcommunicate. Openness breeds authenticity.
  * Be pragmatic. Too many communities are all talk and no action.
  * Be personal. Focus on quality, not quantity.
  * Be positive. Highly positive environments generate positive engagement.
  * Be collaborative. Avoid decisions mide in a sile. Involve peolpe, gather their feedback, get a gut check, and validate your ideas.
  * Be a leader. Don't be afraid of unpopular decisions.
  * Be a role model.
  * Be empathetic. Be intentional about saying and demonstrating it visibly, not just being empathetic in the privacy of your own mind.
  * Be down-to-earth.
  * Be imperfect. Shape the community together with them, complete with the successes and failures therein.

* Key Components of a Launch:
  * Infrastructure and Content Finalized
  * Early Adopter Program - get feedback, ask questions, and ask them to help promote
  * Teasers Launched
  * Announce Launch Event
  * Launch Day

* Content:
  * Growth requires a multimedia approach. Content is a fantastic way to build growth. New communities typically face awareness gaps (what your product/community is) and skill gaps (how to get involved). Content around these can close gaps and bring people in.
  * Growth brings people in, but engagement makes them stick around.
  * Need a constant drip feed of content, which should be managed in an editorial calendar. Shoot for: 1 blog per week, 2 social media posts per week, 1 themed campaign per quarter, 1 online event per quarter.
  * Focus on key topics that target audience personas will find valuable.

* Incentives and Rewards:
  * Produce a series of incentives to keep the journey interesting and rewarding. Be sure to engage with them, interact with them, get to know them, build relationships, and support their broader success.
  * Casual - focus on making them feel at home and help them be successful.
    * Be responsive and help solve their problems. Always emphasize that you are there to help.
    * Validate and celebrate their efforts.
    * Break the ice and build a relationship.
    * Help them find opportunities to make an impact.
  * Regulars - focus on streamlining their experience
    * Optimize, optimize, optimize. Pay attention to how Regulars engage and find ways to make it easier, more efficient, and more fun.
    * Regularly gather feedback.
    * Promote success.
    * Provide opportunities.
    * Put them in positions of trust and authority. If they are dependable, start to depend on them.
  * Core - focus on helping them engage with the broader health and success of the community itself.
    * Have a regular engagement with them.
    * Reward them comprehensively.
    * Include them at a strategic level.
    * Understand and serve their broader goals.
    * Invite blunt feedback.

* Mentoring - builds a "pay it forward culture"
  * Peer-Based Review - powerful way to scale how members provide feedback to members. Additionally everyone can benefit from seeing this feedback in the open, even observers, so they can understand the history and norms of the project.
  * Coaching - generally in more handpicked scenarios to connect those with notable potential to other members, by asking them if they would mentor. The trickiest part is osften that there will be far more people who could benefit from coaching than mentors available.
  * Training - provide 1-2 sessions per quarter covering the most critical knowledge gaps in your community. Look for areas where you strategically want to build skills and capabilities and where there is interest.

* Iterating/evolving practice
  * Observe the data and look for patterns
  * Develop a hypothesis
  * Devise an experiment - never run an experiment you can't map to actionable changes
  * Review the results
  * Determine next steps - never test a hypothesis and then fail to make any strategic adjustments based on it.

* The best ideas come from different brains, so get more brains involved.

* We are incentivized by clear rewards, great experiences, working with smart people, and accomplishing new or novel outcomes.
* When we map the right rewards to the right incentives, they can generate desirable human behavior, which it turn generates value.
* Don't just incentivize things you can measure with computers, but also things you measure with judgement and observation.
* Always start with intrinsic rewards to build satisfaction and belonging.
* If/when you utilize swag, be sure it is meaningful and personal.
* Fundamental ingredients of incentives:
  * Goal - What is the desired behavior?
  * Reward - Go back to personas and review Motivations. What kinds of rewards and recognition motivates them?
  * Condition - What measurable criteria needs to be met before being rewarded?
    * Be Measurable - there are exceptions for rewarding human behavior (insight, kindness, mentorship, support, etc)
    * Be Representative - does this condition represent the desired behavior?
    * Be Varied in Difficulty
    * (Where Possible) Be Automated
* The fundamental goal is to have a series of incentives that keep people transitioning forward: on-ramp, casual, regular, then core. Focus initial incentives around these transition points between phases.
* Stated incentives are published with clear criteria and rewards.
* Submarine incentives use preprogrammed ways to detect great community participation and validate/reward it in a human, personal way. It should use a computer to detect, but then ask a person to personally engage. This allows us to scale up while keeping a personal touch. Important submarine incentive rules:
  * Make them fair.
  * Keep the recipe secret.
  * Mix extrinsic and intrinsic rewards.
  * Make them personal.
  * Build in access and engagement. Submarine incentives can trigger opportunities for access and influence.
  * Start small and build up.
* Reputation systems are a common way to provide a numerical representation of individual member participation.
  * If you use a reputation system, ideally the reputation will decay so that it shows a measure of recent activity, not just activity at some point in time.
  * Can help see spread of least to most active members, spot trends in activity, determine Casual/Regular/Core levels, and provide conditions for incentives/rewards.
  * Think carefully about whether or not to publicly publish member reputation scores. If your community is intended to be competitive, it may make sense, but if it is more collaborative, it might get in the way.
* Rules for Successful Gamification:
  * Focus on onboarding and skill acquisition. Avoid repitition of activity (ie tenth post, hundredth post, etc) as this can be easily abused.
  * As you design, ensuring the gamified things are discoverable is critical.
  * Gamification needs a clear path forward, so focus on dependencies. For example, if you want content creation gamified, you may first need to gamify account registration.
  * Set clear expectations of the step-by-step instructions a member would need to do in order to accomplish the reward.
  * Protect against "gaming the system".
  * Be wary of elevated egos.
* Ensure that messaging/engagement makes it clear that gamification is one way of participating, but that there are other ways in which people add value.
* Incentives can help keep members interested, engaged, and rewarded. Importantly though, keep personal touch front and center, as communities thrive on personal relationships.
* Keep a cynical eye on incentives. Have you struck the right balance? If not, refine until they feel supportive of members' success, validation, and relationships.

* Integrating live events
  * Start by offering yourself as a guest speaker at meetups or conferences. Focus on sharing lessons learned that are of general interest to the audience.
  * Now co-organize a small event (like a meetup) with another organization.
  * As your community grows, organize your own meetup. Free events can have as much as a 50 percent dropout rate, so really push for signups.
  * Now consider more a more in-depth, dedicated event coscheduled with another conference (when people will be in town already).
  * Finally, organize your own dedicated event.
* When considering other events to join, consider: whether target audience personas will be in attendence, if there is strategic benefit, and the cost/benefit of what you aim to accomplish.
  * Focus on speaking and content delivery
  * Plan meetings and local opportunities in advance
  * Prioritize the hallway track
  * Bring business and community overview cards
  * Network extensively, especially at social events
  * Evening events are where relationships are often formed
  * Divide and conquer, if you are attending with others from your company, don't just keep huddled together.
  * After the event, be sure to follow up with further meetings. While things are still fresh in mind schedule time for calls or in-person meetings. Be sure to go into meetings with a clear idea of what you want and a clear sense of what you can offer
* Event Content Types
  * Digital Training - hour-ish webinar where people can register to learn a specific topic or skill. Focus on demos and interactive examples where possible, keep the last fifteen minutes for questions, and make recordings available to the community.
  * Training Workshop - create a set of 45 minute to 1 hour classes around different key topics. Teach fundamentals for 10-20 minutes to provide understanding, then break into small groups to undertake relate tasks. As tasks wrap up, as groups to share their findings with the rest of the group.
  * Round-table discussions - where attendees provide training, discuss ideas, and make plans. Each session should have a clear goal: either teach a specific skill/technique or a clear set of tasks/recommendations for the coming months. Provides a way for community to be involved in strategy, align an projects, grow skills, and develop relationships.
* Event should provide clarity not just on what work is going to happen, but who is doing it and when it should be done. Ideally this information should be captured publicly so that those not attending can follow along.
* Event Planning
  * Decide on Structure
  * Finalize Attendees and Content - only invite Regular and Core members. Invite those who have already proven their value, not just opinionated folks.
  * Invite people to submit topics for discussion:
    * Publicize target themes of the next year
    * Provide a place where people can submit session ideas
    * Select sessions and send guidance
  * Run the event - you want people to leave with a sense of accomplishment and substance
  * Follow Through after the Event
* If possible allow others to dial in
  * provide a live stream so others can listen
  * provide real-time chat that all attendees can join in person or from a far
  * have a projector with the chat channel in each session room

* Community needs to be integrated into your organization, with the right people hired to deliver it, and building on organizational capabilities.
* Key areas to judge Community Director/Manager/Evalgelist candidates: Domain Expertise, People Person, Willingness to Grow.
* Keys to bringing clarity and reducing risk of strategy falling apart:
  * Community is everyone's priority. If leaders demonstrate good community habits, staff will too.
  * Get departmental alignment. Ensure all departments are clearly aligned in what role they play in delivering community strategy. Be sure to get commitment to delivery and an understanding that not delivering is not an option.
  * Operate on Cadence cycle, blending execution and regular steps back to review strategy.
  * Train and Mentor
  * Execute, Review, Repeat. Don't just judge if your team delivers, but how they deliver and any problems they face.
* Perfection is not required, but focus is.

* How to keep learning:
  * Read/review this material again.
  * Surround yourself with new ideas.
  * Interview and ask questions.
  * Test and challenge your assumptions.
  * Document, share, and discuss.
* Be vulnerable
* The human condition is not a fearful, angry, divided one. It is a social and supportive one. We thrive together.
