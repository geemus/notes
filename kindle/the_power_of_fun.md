# The Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again by Catherine Price

- As part of my research for How to Break Up With Your Phone, my husband and I had been taking regular twenty-four-hour breaks from all screens, usually from Friday to Saturday nights. (120)
- Instead of allowing our time to be filled, we now were in charge of how we wanted to fill it. (122)
- There was just one problem: I no longer knew what I enjoyed. It turned out that, for all of its benefits, “breaking up” with my phone was only the first step. If I really wanted to reclaim my life, I needed to remember how to live. (124)
- Which really means that I’m just waiting to die. Around the same time, I had been reading a book called Designing Your Life, in which two Stanford professors use design principles to help people build “well-lived, joyful lives.” (132)
- The exercise asks you to decide how full your “tanks” are in four areas—love, work, health, and play—so that you can identify the parts of your life that need attention. (135)
- But play? Or, as the authors put it, “activity that brings you joy just for the pure sake of doing it”? I could hardly think of anything that would qualify. (137)
- What is something you’ve always said you wanted to do but that you supposedly don’t have time for? (141)
- True Fun, I realized, is the feeling of being fully present and engaged, free from self-criticism and judgment. It is the thrill of losing ourselves in what we’re doing and not caring about the outcome. (199)
- Before we dive in, it’s important to acknowledge that we can only focus on True Fun if our basic needs are taken care of—food, shelter, adequate rest, and physical safety are definitely prerequisites, and there are many situations that can make it difficult, if not impossible, to focus on fun, such as poverty, sickness, abuse, trauma, and job insecurity. (227)
- Even if we haven’t received an official diagnosis, many of us are suffering from emptiness, loneliness, boredom, and a general sense of languishing. But I would argue that in many cases, we are mixing up the cause and the effect: we are suffering from these afflictions because we are not having enough fun. True Fun isn’t just a result of happiness, in other words; it’s a cause. (240)
- Instead, the first step in having more True Fun is to create space by doing fewer things, so that you can take advantage of opportunities for True Fun in your life that already exist and spend your free time in more targeted ways. (246)
- One of the foundational issues we face, when it comes to making True Fun a priority, is that we’ve been conditioned to believe that the pursuit of fun—particularly our own fun—is frivolous, selfish, and self-indulgent, even immature and childish. (255)
- We enjoy it when we experience it, but when it comes to our priorities, it’s often at the very end of the list. (261)
- But what we don’t realize is that, far from being frivolous or selfish, the pursuit of fun will help us achieve all of these goals. (262)
- And if we want our own lives to be satisfying and joyful, True Fun isn’t optional. It shouldn’t be an afterthought. It should be our guiding star. (265)
- Even if you do buy into the idea that True Fun is important and decide that you want to have more of it, it can be hard to know how to start. (266)
- We have more control over fun than we realize; we just need to better understand the factors that generate it for us personally, and design (and put ourselves in) more situations in which these factors are present. It is worth the effort. (275)
- True Fun is restorative. It increases resilience and empathy. It creates community. It reduces resentment. (279)

# Part 1: Fun, Seriously (318)

## Chapter 1: What Is Fun? (320)

- True Fun is the confluence of playfulness, connection, and flow. Whenever these three states occur at the same time, we experience True Fun. (453)
- By playfulness I mean a spirit of lightheartedness and freedom—of doing an activity just for the sake of doing the activity and not caring too much about the outcome. (458)
- True Fun always involves a sense of connection—the feeling of having a special, shared experience with someone (or something) else. (464)
- Flow is a term used in psychology to describe when you are fully engrossed and engaged in your present experience to the point that you lose track of the passage of time. (471)
- Playfulness, connection, and flow only exist in the moment when we feel them, which explains the fascinating fact that True Fun occurs exclusively in the present tense. (490)
- Also, unlike positive states such as happiness or satisfaction, True Fun is an experience. (491)
- Defining what True Fun is also helped me clarify what it is not. Simply put, if none of the three ingredients for fun are present, then we’re unlikely to enjoy ourselves at all. And if there’s anything that prevents us from experiencing one of them, whether it be playfulness, connection, or flow, then we cannot—and will not—have True Fun. (503)
- Distraction is probably the greatest offender, since it gets in the way of all three. (506)
- Judgment is also a fun killer. In order to judge something, we have to step out of an experience so that we can evaluate it, and (as we just noted) when we are out of our present experience, we are obviously not in flow. (514)
- there are many objectively positive states, such as satisfaction or wonder or awe, that don’t necessarily fit the definition of True Fun. (520)
- True Fun is more likely to happen when it has space to unfurl. (530)
- Also not fun? Material possessions. (531)
- But while possessions can facilitate fun (for example, if said possessions are water skis), objects themselves are not fun. (532)
- Neither is self-medication. (533)
- The fact that playfulness, connection, and flow are all active states also means that anything that could be described as passive consumption cannot, by definition, generate True Fun on its own. (540)
- As I see it, the main problem with passive consumption is that when it’s made too easy and accessible—as it is on our televisions and devices—it runs the risk of becoming a form of drug itself, something we use to seek pleasure and avoid pain (both for ourselves and for our kids). (552)
- And every time we use it to numb ourselves, it saps time and energy that we could be putting toward the pursuit of True Fun. (555)
- Indeed, the beauty of evaluating your life through the filters of playfulness, connection, and flow is that it can help you crystalize the difference between things that hold the potential to catalyze True Fun (i.e., your fun magnets), things that are pleasant (and that thus may be worthwhile, even if not True-Fun-generating), and things that are straight-up time sucks. (558)
- Anything we do for leisure is voluntary, otherwise it wouldn’t count as leisure—and leisure is supposed to be enjoyable. So, if you’re not enjoying a leisure activity, you should just stop doing it and make room for something else. (564)
- As I alluded to earlier, Fake Fun is my term for activities and pursuits that are deliberately designed to fool us into thinking that they’ll produce True Fun but that don’t actually result in playful, connected flow. (578)
- Much like junk food, Fake Fun gives us a quick fix of pleasure but ultimately doesn’t make us feel good—and, over time, it can actually harm our mental and physical health. (582)

## Chapter 2: Why You Feel Dead Inside (609)

- We can’t control the fact that we will die. But we can control whether we actually live. (631)
- While disconcerting, the idea that most things don’t matter is also freeing. We can create our own meaning and purpose and joy. We can chart our own paths. (633)

### OUR LIVES ARE WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO (636)

- This is why philosopher Simone Weil called attention “the rarest and purest form of generosity.” (641)
- Our choice of where to direct our attention also affects our emotions and moods. (645)
- The words we use to talk about attention and time—we pay attention; we spend time—are the same verbs we use to discuss money, which implies that we understand their value, at least subconsciously. (649)
- But what we don’t seem to appreciate is that when it comes to experiencing meaning and joy (and, for that matter, fun), attention is actually the most valuable of these three currencies. (651)
- Adding to the challenge is the fact that our brains can only pay full attention to one cognitively demanding thing at a time. (655)
- Our attention, in other words, is zero-sum, (662)
- How can you build a life full of playfulness, connection, and flow when you’ve never been taught that they’re important (or, even more concerningly, if you haven’t experienced them to begin with)? (680)
- How are you supposed to appreciate True Fun—and lose yourself in its joy—if you’ve been raised to view life as a competition in which resources and opportunities are scarce, and you are constantly being ranked and judged? (682)
- What is clear, however, is that humans require social connections in order to flourish (more on that in a bit), that our greatest achievements occur when we are in flow, and that our need for play is intrinsic, biologically driven, and consistent across cultures and throughout time. (701)

### THE TIME-VALUE PARADOX (716)

- time-value paradox: we’ve been conditioned to believe that our time is too valuable to waste, and yet we often end up spending our leisure hours on things that make us feel like we’ve wasted our time. (717)
- The evolution of how we’ve thought about time is covered in fascinating detail in Celeste Headlee’s 2020 book, Do Nothing: How to Break Away from Overworking, Overdoing, and Underliving. (720)
- Our conflation of having lots of money and material possessions with having fun incentivizes us to spend more of our time working so that we can earn more money to buy more things. (740)
- What this all boils down to is that we have internalized the idea that time is a commodity that can be traded, and that the most important thing we can trade it for is money; therefore, any use of time that does not result in financial compensation is not a valuable use of time. (746)
- Unfortunately, “the feeling of being productive is not the same as actually producing something.” (755)
- In addition to making us less playful, our emphasis on work and productivity reduces our opportunities for connection. (770)
- In many cases, we’ve lost or abandoned the social structures and scaffolding that facilitated the casual ties and spontaneous interactions that fostered feelings of connection and community to begin with. (772)
- Indeed, we’re living in the midst of what many experts call an epidemic of loneliness. (779)
- In an unfortunate irony, our interactions with our phones—i.e., our communication devices—often make the problem worse. (791)
- Phones are unlikely to make us lonelier if we are using them as phones (i.e., to call people)—but passively scrolling through people’s feeds is associated with symptoms of depression and lower self-esteem and self-worth. (798)
- The gig economy and our lack of safety nets (from health and retirement benefits to paid parental leave) make it hard to be present in the moment, let alone enjoy ourselves, because everything feels so precarious. (809)
- Simply put, it is impossible to be in flow—and therefore to have True Fun—if your attention is divided. (813)
- Our output-driven approach to time—and the lack of value we assign to fun—also has the unfortunate result of making us seek quantifiable outcomes for our social lives, too. (817)
- we make decisions based on the public images that we have cultivated rather than on what we actually want. (824)
- We’re left with no energy to pursue playfulness, connection, or flow, which is an unfortunate irony, given that playfulness, connection, and flow each generate far more energy and satisfaction than any hard-earned “like” on social media ever could. (827)

### THE CASE FOR SCREEN-LIFE BALANCE (849)

- if we want to live meaningful, joyful, fully engaged lives, we need to protect our attention from anything that distracts us and pulls us toward Fake Fun—starting with the temptations on our screens. (868)
- “polluted time,” or “time confetti,” a term that journalist Brigid Schulte coined that refers to all the seconds and minutes lost to unproductive and unsatisfying multitasking. (882)
- Whereas flow rejuvenates us, time confetti makes us exhausted. (891)

### HOW OUR BRAINS HAVE BEEN HACKED (903)

- If we find it difficult to change our habits, it doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with us or that we have no willpower. It’s because apps have been designed to hook us. (938)
- In the attention economy, we are not the customers or the vendors; we are the users (an ominous term!), and our attention is the product that is being sold. (945)
- Instead of being consumed by the fear of what we might miss if we were to put down our phones, we should think about all the things we definitely miss when we pick them up. (994)
- In fact, there are so many similarities between our phones and slot machines that experts such as Harris refer to phones as slot machines that we keep in our pockets. This is a big deal, because slot machines are considered to be some of the most addictive machines ever to have been invented. (1029)
- The more I’ve learned about these techniques (which are known, quite euphemistically, as “persuasive design”), the more terrified I’ve become—both for us adults and for our kids. (1036)
- Indeed, in many cases our habits have become so extreme that they look a lot like a behavioral addiction. (1043)
- The nondiscriminatory nature of our dopamine systems means that throwing off our internal compasses is quite simple: you just bake dopamine triggers into your product’s design. (1090)
- There are dopamine triggers all over our phones, (1097)
- The three that are most relevant, when it comes to deceiving us into wasting our time on the pursuit of Fake Fun, are novelty, rewards, and unpredictability. (1098)

### NOVELTY (1102)

- Any time we experience something new, we’re going to get a little spritz of dopamine. (1103)
- Just as it’s possible to build up tolerance to a drug, the more accustomed your brain gets to receiving these regular hits from your devices, the more dopamine it will take to satisfy your cravings, and the more dependent on your devices you’ll become. (1110)
- “This is one of the worst parts of tech addiction,” David Greenfield explained to me. “It dulls reality.” (1114)

### REWARD (1118)

- rewards are also a huge dopamine trigger. (1119)
- On some level, we all know that most online affirmation is meaningless, that being “connected” on social media isn’t the same as feeling connected in real life, and that online “communities” too often turn into polarized tribes. But it doesn’t matter. Humans are a social species, and even the most introverted among us still evolved to exist in groups. We care what other people think. (1122)
- And the fact that we never know for sure how or when people will respond to us only makes it harder to stop. (1148)

### UNPREDICTABILITY (1150)

- To our brains, an uncertain outcome is far more seductive than something that’s guaranteed. (1153)
- Psychologists refer to this as “intermittent reinforcement,” and it’s such a powerful dopamine trigger that it’s considered to be one of the most effective techniques to manipulate people’s behavior. (1157)
- Much of the power of intermittent reinforcement has to do with anticipation—namely, the fact that our brains release more dopamine in anticipation of a possible reward than they do when the reward is guaranteed. (1160)
- It’s important to note that there’s nothing inherently wrong with our brains’ attraction to novelty, rewards, and unpredictability. (1175)
- But the dose makes the poison. (1178)

### THE CONSEQUENCES (1187)

- We have a sense of what we’ve gained—mostly convenience, easy communication, and access to limitless entertainment and information. We have a much less solid sense of what we’ve lost—or, in the case of people who have grown up with smartphones and nonstop internet access, what we never had at all. (1190)

### PERPETUAL DISTRACTION (1204)

- When it comes to the ways in which our phones are rewiring our psychology and physiology—and affecting the way we experience our own lives—their ability to distract us is at the top of the list. (1204)
- when you’re distracted, you’re not in flow, and if you’re not in flow, you can’t have True Fun. (1209)
- It also blocks connection. (1210)
- Our inability to stay focused also interferes with our ability to create memories. (1212)
- If we don’t have long-term memories, we can’t have insights (1218)
- The sheer amount of information available on (and shoved into our brains by) our phones is also likely harming our creativity. (1222)
- Just as too much sunlight makes it impossible to see, too much information makes it impossible for us to think. (1227)
- When we spend all of our time scrolling and surfing, listening and watching—in other words, when we spend all our time consuming—we’re spraying our brains with an unrelenting fire hose of information and giving them no chance to come up with new insights, ideas, or thoughts. (1231)

### FOMO AND CORTISOL (1236)

- Whereas True Fun focuses our attention—when we’re having it, there’s nowhere else we’d rather be—FOMO makes it impossible for us to ever be fully present. It scatters our attention and makes us anxious, often to the point at which our bodies release a stress hormone called cortisol. (1242)
- Unfortunately, just as the dopamine system can’t distinguish habits that are good for us from habits that are bad, the cortisol system can’t differentiate between threats that are physical and threats that are emotional (or, for that matter, threats that are consequential and those that are trivial). It responds the same way regardless. (1249)
- A lot of these effects have to do with the fact that when we’re stressed-out and our cortisol levels are high, the prefrontal cortex—the area of our brain responsible for decision-making and rational thought——goes offline. (1258)
- But when the prefrontal cortex is offline, we’re left with less self-control and a powerful desire to make our anxiety go away—the faster, the better. (1267)
- there’s nothing inherently stressful about a smartphone itself. But for many of us, our phones function as communication and delivery devices for some of the main sources of anxiety in our lives—for (1272)
- it’s well established that chronically elevated cortisol levels increase the risk for a wide range of health problems including depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, fertility issues, digestive problems, Alzheimer’s disease, and even cancer. (1279)
- not only does True Fun feel better than nonstop work and screen time, it can actually prevent and even reverse many of their negative effects. True Fun isn’t a distraction from our problems, in other words. It’s a solution. (1296)

## Chapter 3:Why Fun—True Fun—Is the Answer (1442)

- I want to emphasize that the most important benefit of orienting our lives toward True Fun is the fun itself. (1448)

### PLAYFULNESS (1492)

- According to the founder of the National Institute for Play (and one of the world’s foremost experts on the subject), Stuart Brown, “The times we feel most alive, those that make up our best memories, are moments of play.” (1493)
- According to Brown, “play” describes any activity that is “absorbing [and] apparently purposeless” and that “provides enjoyment and a suspension of self-consciousness and sense of time. It is also self-motivating and makes you want to do it again.” (1505)
- Any activity can count as play if we approach it with a playful state of mind. (1508)
- playfulness refers to the ability to let down your guard, shed formality, not care too much about outcomes, and open yourself to—indeed, proactively seek out—opportunities for humor and lighthearted connection. (1510)
- What’s more, play and playfulness can help us get back in touch with (or figure out for the first time) who we actually are. (1524)
- play has been found to increase the brain’s production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which stimulates nerve growth in areas of the brain associated with emotional processing and decision-making, (1528)
- Allowing your playfulness to come out—or cultivating playfulness, if it’s not your normal modus operandi—can have a remarkable ripple effect on your happiness and satisfaction in other areas of life as well. (1536)
- Playfulness is often a proxy for confidence and closeness; if you’re comfortable with someone, you’re more likely to allow yourself to be playful. (1540)
- But playfulness itself also brings people closer, makes them feel comfortable, and creates special, shared experiences. (1541)
- Playfulness is also a great way to attract new people to you—whether as romantic partners, colleagues, or friends—because people who are playful are simply more fun to be around. (1544)
- What’s more, when you’re playful with the same people over time, it can create bonds between groups of people that persist even when you’re not actively playing, making play what play scholar Miguel Sicart has called “a string with which we tie our memories and our friendships together.” (1550)
- In all these cases, what started as shared interests blossomed into bona fide communities. We had become connected through play. (1567)

### CONNECTION (1569)

- Among the disturbing things that I discovered: when it comes to dying early, being socially isolated is thought to be an even bigger risk factor than physical inactivity and health problems associated with obesity. (1586)
- Steve Cole, PhD, director of the Social Genomics Core Laboratory at UCLA, refers to loneliness as being a “fertilizer for other diseases.” (1589)
- Like depression, loneliness also affects our brains in ways that impair our ability to think clearly and pull ourselves out of our ruts. (1598)
- Unlike passive scrolling, the pursuit of True Fun reduces loneliness and increases our sense of connection by encouraging active engagement with other people in real life. (1601)
- The study has found that the people with the strongest relationships lived longer, reported higher levels of happiness and satisfaction, and suffered less cognitive decline. (1619)
- True Fun brings out our shared humanity, which, as we’ll see in a bit, is extremely good for our emotional well-being (not to mention the future of humankind). (1634)
- Interestingly, you don’t need to know a person particularly well in order to experience the positive effects of playful in-person human connection. (1635)
- What’s more, the connections we experience when we are having fun aren’t just limited to other people. (1640)
- True Fun frequently occurs alongside physical activity—which is a form of connection with our bodies—and physical activity is good for our health and for our moods. (1641)
- In fact, being in nature has so many positive psychological benefits that some researchers quasi-jokingly use the word “outdoorphins” to describe the types of endorphins that are triggered by being outside. (1644)
- With that said, when we do experience an unexpected sense of connection with other people, the resulting energy can be rapturous. There’s even a term for it: “collective effervescence,” (1646)

### FLOW (1654)

- flow—that is, a state of total engagement, in which you are so engrossed in the activity at hand that you lose track of time; (1655)
- Not only does connection often produce a state of flow but flow itself can create connection. (1657)
- What’s more, flow is also marked by a total lack of self-consciousness, (1661)
- When we are in flow, we don’t fear failure. (1663)
- Learning to get flow from as many of our experiences as possible might just be, (1671)
- Ikigai, roughly speaking, is what the French call raison d’être—our reason for being. (1674)
- The more you’re in flow, say García and Miralles, “the closer you will be to your ikigai.” (1683)
- (Ogimi is known as “the village of longevity” because of the number of seriously ancient people who live there.) (1686)
- The residents were constantly getting together to socialize—and bringing García and Miralles along with them. (1689)
- One of the elderly residents they interviewed summed up the community’s values: “Spending time together and having fun is the only thing that matters.” (1693)
- “junk” flow: a state that can be pleasant but is also mind-numbing (1696)
- Junk flow encourages consumption without actually engaging us. (1697)

### LAUGHTER (1702)

- Thankfully, there is a telltale sign of True Fun that has been relatively well studied: laughter. (1704)
- True, sometimes we laugh when we’re not having fun. But when we’re truly having fun, we nearly always laugh—to the point that I’ve begun to use laughter as a way to differentiate True Fun from enjoyment. (1705)
- Laughter reduces levels of cortisol and an accompanying stress hormone, adrenaline, (1713)
- Good-humored, genuine laughter also triggers a cascade of reactions that can reduce inflammation in blood vessels, reduce clotting, decrease blood pressure, and improve vascular health. (1715)
- In addition to lifting our moods in the moment, humor also reduces our risk of stress- and anxiety-related diseases such as heart attacks and strokes in the long run. (1722)
- Laughter also releases endorphins that have been found to increase people’s tolerance for physical pain. (1725)
- Researchers also believe that the particular types of endorphins triggered by laughter play an important role in social bonding and help buffer us against the physical effects of stress. (1728)
- The more we laugh together, in other words, the more connected (and less lonely) we feel; (1734)

### HOW FUN MAKES US HAPPY (1742)

- That’s yet another power of fun: it produces happiness. (1747)
- More specifically, the pursuit of fun provides a blueprint for happiness by shifting our focus from an amorphous emotional state (I want to be happy) to an active experience (I want to have more fun). (1747)
- The pursuit of fun results in a self-perpetuating positive cycle: having fun makes us happy, and when we’re happy we’re more likely to have fun, which in turn makes us happy, which makes it easier for us to have fun—and on and on and on. (1752)
- S(et point) + C(ircumstances) + V(oluntary behaviors) = H(appiness) (1758)
- To me, the beauty of True Fun (and more specifically, the beauty of defining it as the confluence of playfulness, connection, and flow) is that it can help us generate concrete ideas for what these happiness-inducing voluntary activities could be. In other words, it helps transform something abstract and elusive into something that is attainable and under our control. (1763)

### HOW FUN HELPS US FLOURISH (1766)

- Flourishing is a term psychologists use to refer to a state of optimal human functioning in which we feel engaged, open, purposeful, self-accepting, resilient, robust, motivated, and satisfied. (1767)
- According to Martin Seligman, director of the University of Pennsylvania Positive Psychology Center and author of the book Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-Being (and a flourishing convert himself), there are five fundamental elements of flourishing: positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning, and positive accomplishment. (1771)
- When I thought about it, I realized that each of these five elements is often present in—and often directly generated by—fun. (1774)
- theory of positive emotions, created by Barbara Fredrickson. It asserts that positive emotional states, even if fleeting, aren’t just signs of resilience, well-being, and health; they actually build resilience and health, and help people weather future periods of stress. (1785)

### THE EFFECTS (1794)

- But if our basic needs are met and our ultimate goal is a meaningful, joyful life, then we’re not actually gaining much psychologically by stacking up accolades and excess wealth—and money and productivity are not the primary metrics we should rely on when we evaluate our use of time. Instead, I propose that we use True Fun. (1808)
- As Celeste Headlee writes in her book Do Nothing, “Few of our daily activities are focused on helping us become more naturally playful or thoughtful or, god forbid, social.” (1818)
- Today, having a relaxed lunch with a friend or taking a break in the middle of the day to call someone no longer seems like an unnecessary luxury, and organizing a weekend away with friends no longer seems like too much work. Instead, I now recognize them as valuable investments in my well-being. (1826)
- Fun can also help us flourish by changing the way we approach decisions. These days, when I encounter a nonmandatory request—even if it’s potentially positive, such as a new opportunity—I ask myself: Does this feel fun? Will it generate playfulness, connection, or flow? If so, I consider saying yes. If not—or if saying yes will reduce the time I have available for more meaningful, enjoyable, or rewarding activities—I do my best to say no. (1829)
- I also try to pay attention to my body—it doesn’t lie. If I feel any sort of tightness or clenching, or if my breath becomes shallow or short, it’s a sign that I shouldn’t agree. On the flip side, if I notice lightness or excitement, I consider saying yes, even if the idea of doing so makes my stomach flutter. (1832)
- Using fun to guide our decisions can also make us more productive. (1835)
- (Take a hard look at your workday, in other words: How much of your time are you spending on things that are meaningful or essential to your job—or you—versus on being reactive?) (1838)
- This has led me to believe that fun may play a role in the “undo” hypothesis, put forth by Barbara Fredrickson, the aforementioned director of the PEP lab. According to this theory, positive emotions, such as those produced by fun, can actually “correct” or “undo” the effects of negative emotions. (1850)
- Fun can also help us avoid burnout. (1856)
- Then I read Alex Soojung-Kim Pang’s book Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less. In it, he writes that many of the world’s greatest writers, scientists, and artists “balance busy lives with deep play, forms of rest that are psychologically restorative, physically active, and personally meaningful.” (1864)
- Speaking of which, the pursuit of True Fun can also make us more creative; the more regularly we experience it, the more new ideas we are likely to have. (1877)
- What’s more, the lack of self-consciousness we experience when we’re having True Fun puts us in a safe, open psychological state that is itself conducive to creativity. As an example, consider what happens during musical improvisation, (1890)

# Part II How to Have Fun (1959)

## Chapter 4: The Fun Audit (1962)

### DON’T TRY TO HAVE MORE FUN (1968)

- The problem with trying to have more fun is that the phrase “have fun” isn’t specific enough; it doesn’t tell you what you’re actually supposed to do. (1971)
- In other words, True Fun is like romance: we can set the mood for it, but if we try too hard, our attempts will likely backfire. (1976)
- The first step of our fun audit 1 will be to zero in on what playful, connected flow feels like in our minds and our bodies—the logic being that you can’t have more True Fun if you don’t know how to recognize it when it occurs. (1978)
- Next, we’ll get a baseline sense of how much True Fun you’re currently having (or not having). We’ll take a fun history to identify some of your past experiences of True Fun and start a fun times journal to track playfulness, connection, and flow in the moments when they happen. (1983)
- We’ll also analyze the things you do “for fun” to suss out whether they actually hold the potential to attract True Fun, or if they’re really Fake Fun in disguise. (1985)
- We’ll use your memories of True Fun and your recent instances of playfulness, connection, and flow to identify your personal fun magnets: specific activities, people, and settings that often attract True Fun for you personally. (1987)
- Then we’ll analyze your magnets to figure out your fun factors—that is, the characteristics that create this magnetism. (1988)
- We’ll also identify your personal anti-fun factors—i.e., things that block you from having fun—so that you can make sure to avoid them. (1992)
- we’ll use an acronym called SPARK—short for “make space, pursue passions, attract fun, rebel, and keep at it”—to orient your internal compass toward your personal fun North Star. (1997)
- Also, please remember: the whole point of this process is to enjoy yourself. To that end, you may want to invite someone whom you like or want to spend more time with to join you. (2004)
- And on that note, please remember that this is meant to be a chance for self-exploration and enjoyment, not a homework assignment. (2008)
- Follow the plan’s basic structure, in other words, but feel free to customize the details. (2010)

### STEP 1: KNOW THE SIGNS OF TRUE FUN (2021)

- first step is to learn to identify some of its most common physical and emotional effects. (2023)
- Part of building a more fun-filled life is appreciating the moments of micro fun that pop up nearly every day, whether they be a few seconds of banter with a supermarket clerk, or a chance to give someone a compliment or playful smile. (2042)

### STEP 2: ESTABLISH A BASELINE (2045)

- we’ll use a tool I developed called the fun frequency questionnaire to establish a baseline of how much True Fun you’re currently having (or not having) so that you can identify areas that need help—I recommend revisiting it every few months to measure your progress. (2046)

### STEP 3: TAKE YOUR FUN HISTORY (2079)

- Start by getting yourself a journal or a notebook—ideally, one that you like and enjoy writing in, since you’ll be using it in other steps, too. Set aside sixty or so undistracted minutes for the next few exercises. (Turn off your phone!) (2083)
- Begin by reflecting back on three experiences in your life that you would describe as True Fun: moments in which you felt completely present, engaged, and alive, in which time seemed to simultaneously stand still and fly by, and that were so joyous and energizing—so fun—that they count as some of your most treasured memories. (2085)
- Once you have one in mind, close your eyes and try to put yourself back in the moment. Immerse yourself as fully as you can. Imagine the sights, the sounds, the smells, the feeling in your mind and body. Then ask yourself: What exactly were you doing? Where were you? Roughly how old were you? What objects, if any, were involved? Who, if anyone, were you with? What in particular made it feel so fun? (2092)
- Once you’ve written down your three past fun experiences, once you’ve really marinated in the memory of how they made you feel, look forward in time and describe something that you would love to organize or participate in in the future that you think might hold the potential to spark True Fun. What would you be doing? Who, if anyone, would you be with? Where would you be? Why would this create True Fun for you? (2124)
- Once you have a description of three past memories of True Fun and an idea for something you’d like to do in the future (or just fantasize about), ask yourself what, if anything, makes those four experiences different from things that you find (or have found) pleasurable, relaxing, enjoyable, satisfying, or rewarding. (2153)

### STEP 4: KEEP A FUN TIMES JOURNAL (2156)

- The next step in our fun audit is to start a fun times journal to help you identify the activities, people, and settings in your everyday life that energize you and get you into a state of playfulness, connection, and/or flow. (2157)
- The fun times journal is inspired by the “Good Times Journal” from the book Designing Your Life, and the basic idea is simple: you set aside a few minutes each day to record moments in which you felt a sense of connection, playfulness, or flow, as well as anything you did “for fun.” (2164)
- It doesn’t matter how small or fleeting your moments of playfulness, connection, and flow are: write them down, label them with a P, a C, and/or an F, and for each instance, note what you were doing, who you were with, where you were, and what, if any, objects or devices were involved. (2170)
- Once a week or so, review your notes from your daily fun times journal and see if any themes emerge. (2180)
- As you review your journal, also note things you did (or people you spent time with) “for fun” and ask yourself whether they actually produced playfulness, connection, or flow. (2187)
- consider plotting “Things I Do For Fun” on a graph to determine what to keep doing and what to skip, based on the quadrant in which they fall. I’m not kidding! This can be really useful. The x-axis should rate them by enjoyment, and the y-axis by the energy they produce. (2195)
- And be sure to take note of anything proactive that you did that sparked fun. (2224)

## Chapter 5:Find Your Fun (2242)

### STEP 1: KNOW THE PRECONDITIONS (2251)

- You can think of these as being like the foundation of a house: they’re the base that supports everything you build. (2253)
- Being Engaged and Present (2256)
- Not Feeling Judged or Self-Conscious (2261)
- Going All-In (2264)
- Fun doesn’t emerge when people are only sort of doing something. (2266)
- Not Caring Too Much about the Outcome (2267)
- Being with Other People (2272)
- Yes, it is possible, in certain circumstances and for certain people, to have fun alone (e.g., the Fun Squad member who found True Fun in her solo swimming session). With that said, it is remarkable how consistently members of the Fun Squad mentioned other people when they reminisced about times that were truly fun—even if they were self-described introverts. (2272)
- Introverts seem most likely to have True Fun when they’re in the presence of a small group of people whom they know (and who know them) well. Extroverts often enjoy small, close groups, too, but are also able to find fun in more boisterous and less intimate situations. (2289)

### STEP 2: FIND YOUR FUN MAGNETS (2293)

- The fact that True Fun is an emotional experience means that, while activities can help generate fun, activities themselves are not fun. (2294)
- With that said, each of us has certain activities—and, for that matter, people, and settings—that are much more likely than others to trigger or enhance our feelings of playfulness, connection, and flow, and thus more likely to attract True Fun. I call these “fun magnets,” and each of us has a collection that’s unique to us. (2297)
- Start by looking at the anecdotes you described in your fun history and scanning your fun times journal for any entry in which playfulness, connection, and flow were all present, and that thus represent moments of True Fun. (2306)
- Also note the activities, settings, and people that were involved when you experienced playfulness, connection, or flow on their own (or in a combination that didn’t include all three). These are magnets for pleasure and enjoyment (and possibly relaxation), and are worth keeping track of, too, even if they never cross the line to full-on fun. (2309)

### STEP 3: FIND YOUR FUN FACTORS (2333)

- Once you have used your fun history and fun times journal to identify some of your fun magnets, the next step is to figure out the general characteristics that create their magnetic pull. (2334)
- Once you have ticked off or circled the fun factors that resonate with you, and that describe your fun magnets and past instances of playfulness, connection, and flow, finding themes should be easy: just notice which fun factors you circled or that have lots of checkmarks next to them. These are your most powerful fun factors and can be used to brainstorm other activities or situations that might generate fun. (2436)
- Also note the fun factors that only have one or two checkmarks next to them. They’re not major fun factors for you, but the fact that they sometimes are present when you’re having fun might give you ideas for future exploration and experimentation. (2441)
- I also recommend doing a scan of your current life to see whether you have adequate opportunities for the three foundational elements of fun—playfulness, connection, and flow—and determine whether they’re in balance. (2443)

### STEP 4: RECOGNIZE YOUR ANTI-FUN FACTORS (2448)

- While you were reading through that list of fun factors, chances are that a few of them jumped out as being totally antithetical to fun, the metaphorical equivalent of the end of the magnet that repels other magnets. (2449)
- With all that said, before you automatically write something off as an anti-fun factor, I invite you to challenge your own assumptions. (2464)

### PUTTING IT INTO ACTION: SPARK (2470)

## Chapter 6:Make Space (2516)

### GIVE YOURSELF A PERMISSION SLIP (2555)

- you may feel a little weird or irresponsible about prioritizing fun, let alone your own fun. (2556)
- I encourage you to give yourself a permission slip to prioritize fun, despite—and perhaps even because of—whatever else might be going on in your life. (2564)

### REDUCE RESENTMENT (2573)

- I learned about a book by Eve Rodsky called Fair Play, (2590)
- The book’s basic premise is that, in order to reduce resentment, you should treat your home life like you would a business. You start by defining and divvying up all the responsibilities and labor, visible and invisible, that go into running a household. Then you set aside regular time to check in with your partner, identify what’s coming up and what needs to be done, and decide who is going to do it. (2592)
- Rodsky points out that much of the mental load comes from the conception and planning, whereas most of the credit goes to the person who completed the execution. This imbalance is one of the main sources of resentment among couples. (2598)
- He suggested that we have a regular coffee date on Monday mornings to go over our plans for the week and divide up our responsibilities more clearly. Over the months that followed, our levels of resentment lowered dramatically, which in turn created space for both of us—both independently and together—to seek opportunities for True Fun. (2633)

### MAKE SPACE FOR OTHER PEOPLE’S FUN (2637)

- If a friend or partner or spouse or child has a fun magnet or fun factor that you don’t share, don’t be a spoilsport. (2642)
- Instead, help them make space for it. Actively encourage them to engage in it. Give them a permission slip to let go and enjoy themselves without worrying that they’ll be scolded later or have to “pay you back.” (2644)

### MAKE PHYSICAL SPACE FOR FUN (2648)

- Constant visual reminders of disorganization drain our cognitive resources and reduce our ability to focus.” (2681)
- Cluttered surroundings have also been associated with higher levels of circulating cortisol, which in turn can contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression. (2682)
- This has a direct effect on our ability to have True Fun. Remember: anything that distracts us or causes anxiety will kick us out of flow, and flow is a precondition for fun. (2687)
- The takeaway here is three-fold. (2701)
- First, you may be able to reduce your levels of anxiety and distraction—both of which block flow and therefore fun—by clearing more physical space in your own home. (2702)
- Second, if you want to invite more fun into your life, it can be useful to fully escape your everyday surroundings once in a while—to create space for yourself by physically removing yourself from your normal environment. (2703)
- Lastly, when you do escape, make sure you pay attention to the qualities of the new space that you’ll be visiting to make sure that it is conducive to fun. (2704)

### CREATE MENTAL SPACE FOR FUN (2709)

- One technique I find useful is to think about my time and attention as a budget. (2715)
- The planner also prompts you to start your day by listing three things you’re grateful for, plus three things you’re excited about or looking forward to—both of which are techniques that have been proven to boost people’s overall sense of well-being. (2741)
- Then, before bed, I put my phone into its charging station, pull out my planner, and respond to its evening prompts (yes, it has evening prompts), which include writing a positive sentence to describe the day and listing three accomplishments and three of the day’s best moments. (2751)
- One of the most important messages I want you to take away from this book is that we have to be understanding toward ourselves. (2759)

### LIMIT YOUR LIST (2765)

- Another way to create more space for yourself is to make a daily list of your “not-to-dos.” (2766)
- It’s also important to limit your lists by reducing the number of responsibilities and leadership roles that you assume, even if they don’t represent a waste of time in the same way as, say, a social media spiral. (2775)
- Then comes the big question: What could you say no to? (2784)
- So, try scanning through your current commitments and seeing what you might want to discard. And any time you’re asked to take on something new, ask yourself: Is this absolutely necessary? (2787)
- You can also use a fun gut check to make decisions about people. (2796)
- When you’re trying to limit your people list, it’s useful to keep Dunbar’s number (or, more precisely, numbers) in mind. (2800)
- He also concluded that the maximum number of people we can maintain close-ish relationships with (with “close-ish” defined as people you might invite to a group dinner) is about fifty. Your intimates—the people you confide in—are likely no more than fifteen; your truest, closest friends are likely limited to about five. (2809)

### BREAK UP WITH YOUR PHONE (2818)

- It simply means giving yourself space to evaluate what’s working and what’s not so that you can create a new, healthier relationship that keeps what you love and minimizes (or eliminates) what you don’t. (2824)
- Instead, it’s more productive to think about screen time—and, indeed, all possible uses of our time—as being like food. (2843)
- Simply ask yourself which uses of your screens are necessary and/or enjoyable, and what amount will leave you feeling sated but not stuffed. (2847)
- I also find it helpful to think about my leisure time—whether with screens or without—as falling into three categories: connection, creation, and consumption. (I call these the three c’s.) (2848)
- It’s an essential step in changing a habit, for a reason that’s very simple yet often overlooked (at least outside the context of Alcoholics Anonymous): you can’t change a habit—or solve a problem—if you haven’t acknowledged its existence. (2869)
- To make it easier to catch yourself, I recommend a two-step process. Start by putting a rubber band or hair tie around your phone. This way, when you reach for your phone on autopilot, you’ll be interrupted by a physical impediment. (2875)
- When that happens, the next step is to ask yourself a series of questions that will help you better understand why you reached for your phone, which in turn will enable you to proactively decide whether you want to be on your phone in that moment. I call this exercise WWW, which is short for: What for? Why now? What else? (2877)
- The point of the exercise isn’t necessarily to get you to put down your phone. It’s simply to make sure that when you engage with your devices, it’s the result of a conscious choice. (2893)
- The basic idea is to use the concept of “friction” to make it harder to fall into the habits you’re trying to change, and easier to engage in the ones you’re trying to establish. (2897)
- The next step in breaking up with your phone is to make your phone as boring as possible—you want it to be a tool, not a temptation. (2915)
- Start by disabling most notifications. (2916)
- Next, redesign your home screen by moving or deleting problematic apps—a technique that addiction psychiatrists refer to as “reducing ease of access.” (2919)

### TAKE BACK YOUR BRAIN (2930)

- Lastly, if you want to make space for fun, you also need to reduce the mental clutter in your own brain. (2931)
- One way to quiet your mind is to consciously embrace boredom. (2940)
- If you want to go a step further, try taking longer breaks from screens. (2946)
- Try not to look at your screens for the first and last hours of your day. (2950)
- Another mind-calming strategy is to try, whenever possible, to do just one thing at a time—which is a precondition for flow, and therefore, True Fun. (2951)
- The more you practice this, the easier it will become (and the better your relationships will be). (2954)
- You could also experiment with mindfulness meditation, which is a secularized form of Buddhist meditation that’s been the subject of much scientific study. (2959)
- First, you have to adopt an attitude of forgiveness toward yourself; as I alluded to earlier, your brain is filled with thoughts because having thoughts is its job. (2965)
- Second, many of us pack our lives to the brim because stillness and space can be deeply uncomfortable; we stay busy so that our anxieties can’t rush in. (2968)
- The challenge is that if you take away that busyness, you may risk another temporary side effect: existential despair. (2971)

### INTERLUDE: THE RISK OF EXISTENTIAL DESPAIR (2973)

## Chapter 7: Pursue Passions (3035)

- We just did a lot of work to create emotional and physical space in our lives. Now we need to identify what we want to do with that space; otherwise, we’ll be left with a vacuum, and it won’t be long before our old habits come rushing back in to fill it. (3145)

### WHAT IT MEANS TO DO THINGS “FOR FUN” (3150)

- When I suggest that we pursue passions, interests, and hobbies, what I’m really saying is that we should do more things “for fun.” Sometimes these activities will lead to True Fun; sometimes they won’t, but they all are enjoyable and rewarding (and, in many cases, easily accessible), and thus are worth our time. (3151)
- In short, if an activity does not generate playfulness, connection, or flow (and our purpose is not enjoyment), then we should not say that we’re doing it for fun. (3166)

### DEFINING INTERESTS, HOBBIES, AND PASSIONS (3171)

- Simply put, passions, hobbies, and interests are activities that we enjoy and that get us into flow. (3172)
- In general, interests are subjects that we enjoy learning about, and hobbies are things that we like to do. (3176)
- The main characteristics that distinguish our passions from our hobbies and interests are the pull we feel toward them and the amount of energy that they produce. (3178)
- But that doesn’t mean that you should only spend time on things you’re passionate about (that’s a pretty high bar!) or be disappointed if you “only” have interests and hobbies. (3184)
- First of all, the fact that they are voluntary means that hobbies, interests, and passions can all be considered forms of play. (3188)
- Interests, hobbies, and passions also foster connection by strengthening preexisting relationships and by introducing you to new people and communities. (3191)
- Lastly, interests, hobbies, and passions give us skills and knowledge that can help us slip into flow in more contexts—and the more we’re in flow, the more alive we will feel. (3198)
- Interests, hobbies, and passions also make you more interested and interesting, (3209)

### THE VALUE OF SOLITARY PURSUITS (3214)

- These pastimes may not be likely to attract True Fun, due to the inherent difficulty of experiencing a sense of connection with another person when you’re alone. But they still are likely to be more enjoyable and rewarding—and make you more interested and interesting—than whatever else you would have done. (3222)
- the other great thing about solitary leisure pursuits is that they often do lead to connections with other people and thus facilitate True Fun, albeit in a roundabout way. (3241)

### HOW TO IDENTIFY—AND DISCOVER—INTERESTS, HOBBIES, AND PASSIONS (3248)

- Unlike fun, you can put hobbies, interests, and passions on your calendar. (3252)
- Passive consumption takes no planning. It is easy and accessible. And considering how mentally exhausted many of us feel, easy and accessible is often exactly what we’re looking for. (3265)
- The problem, in other words, isn’t passive consumption itself; the problem is what happens when passive consumption is our default. (3268)
- If we want to change our defaults and take back control of our leisure time, we need to expand our repertoire of passions, hobbies, and interests, and make these activities as accessible as possible so that they have a chance of competing with the easy, passive options available on our screens. (3277)
- I recommend that you start by looking at your fun times journal and lists of fun magnets to see if you’re already doing things that would qualify but just haven’t yet tagged them as interests, hobbies, or passions. (3287)
- Next, I suggest that you brainstorm new ideas for possible interests, hobbies, and passions. (3289)
- But just as there are certain activities that we enjoyed when we were younger that no longer hold appeal, there are likely to be activities that we did not previously find pleasurable (or that we never felt motivated to try) that might hold the potential to become hobbies, interests, and passions, (3291)
- Speaking of which, novelty itself is such a powerful fun factor that trying new things can often generate fun even if the activity itself doesn’t end up being something that you enjoy. (3295)
- You might already have some ideas in the back of your mind for things that you’re curious about. (3299)
- rowing lessons.) If so, great! Make a plan to try one. If not, one idea is to pick two or three of your fun factors at random and come up with as many activities or subjects as you can think of that would combine them. (3300)
- And make sure that your list also includes ideas for things to do alone, at home, when you’re tired. (3303)
- Once you’ve got a list of ideas, try one! It doesn’t matter what you choose, (3318)
- Then afterward, ask yourself: Did you enjoy it? Is your curiosity piqued? Would you like to do it again? (3319)
- If you’re not sure how you feel, take a page from parenting guidebooks—the ones that suggest that you require your kid to try a new food three times before they decide they truly don’t like it—and give it a few tries before you make a final call. (3322)
- And also, if you’ve given something what you consider to be a good college try and you still are not enjoying yourself, you have permission to stop. (3324)

### WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ONLY GRAVITATE TOWARD SOLITARY ACTIVITIES (3331)

- One idea is to ask someone to join you. (3335)
- Classes are another great way to add a social element to solitary activities. (3338)

### WHAT TO DO IF YOU’RE TOO BUSY TO MAKE ANY MORE COMMITMENTS (3341)

- You have full permission to dabble in whatever appeals to you or piques your curiosity in any given moment, and you can do things for fun in bite-sized pieces—say, the random pockets of time that you usually spend scrolling. (3343)
- If you do find something you truly enjoy that requires a bigger time commitment than you feel you can fit into your schedule, then you may want to revisit the last chapter and explore other options for making space. (3347)

### WHAT TO DO WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE THE OBSTACLE (3351)

- Importantly, Unicorn Space does not refer to the time you spend on passive pursuits, such as following sports or watching television. It’s time for active leisure, the things that make you interested and interesting—a term that she uses as well—and that nourish your internal flame. (It’s (3358)
- This may require some negotiation with the person you live with—first, to get their buy-in that making time for Unicorn Space is worth it, and second, to figure out how to actually do so logistically and without breeding resentment. (3365)
- One idea? Emphasize how important it is for them to have Unicorn Space, too—and encourage them to take it. (3367)

### WHAT TO DO ABOUT DIFFICULTY (HOW TO GET OVER THE HUMP) (3370)

- achieving flow often requires a certain degree of skill or competence—and developing skill and competence can be hard. (3373)
- This is why Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who coined the term “flow,” recommends that when you are in the early stages of any new activity, you build in some external rewards for yourself to keep you motivated until you reach a level at which flow is possible and you’re able to enjoy the activity for its own sake. (3376)
- Eventually you’ll reach a level of competence where these extrinsic motivators will no longer be necessary—for (3384)

### WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU’RE WORRIED THAT YOU’LL FEEL DUMB (3390)

- As play scholar Stuart Brown puts it, “Probably the biggest roadblock to play for adults is the worry that they will look silly, undignified or dumb if they allow themselves to truly play.” (3393)
- Far from being a trigger for humiliation, being an absolute beginner at something can be freeing, because no one expects you to be good. It’s also an act of bravery. (3398)
- One of the unfortunate side effects of our fear of looking dumb is jealousy of people who do seem to manage to try new things: they’re exhibiting a confidence and bravery that we wish we had ourselves. (3409)
- often turn our criticism inward, toward ourselves. But when you’re a beginner at something, it’s essential to avoid any critics who might scare you away by making you feel self-conscious or dumb—including yourself. (3413)
- This brings us to one of the biggest roadblocks of all: our own perfectionism. (3419)
- Not only can perfectionism prevent you from trying new things out of fear of failure, but it can actually be damaging to your health. (3432)
- First, we need to put less pressure on our kids, and teach them from a young age that perfection is not an attainable—or healthy—goal. (3439)
- And second, we need to be better role models by cultivating more acceptance toward ourselves, and not being afraid to put ourselves out there and try new things, even if we might end up feeling (or looking) dumb. (3441)
- One way to loosen perfectionism’s grip is to gently investigate what, exactly, you’re afraid will happen if you do not perform perfectly—and then continue to ask questions until you convince yourself that it’s going to be okay. (3444)
- And also: start small! When it comes to trying new things, there is nothing that says that you need to do something dramatic, like sign up for a dance troupe or try out for a play. (3447)

## Chapter 8: Attract Fun (3465)

- Many people described fun people as being able to laugh at anything. Curiosity and open-mindedness came up a bunch. Being present in the moment did, too (3483)
- being a fun person isn’t something that’s decided at birth; it’s a skill we can develop. (3503)

### ADOPT A FUN MINDSET (3506)

- The primary thing that separates people who attract fun from their supposedly less fun peers is their attitude. (3507)
- (A Fun Mindset is a fun-oriented twist on what Stanford psychology professor Carol Dweck has dubbed a “growth mindset.”) (3509)
- This boils down to deliberately seeking out as many opportunities as you can to create—or appreciate—humor, absurdity, playfulness, connection, and flow. (3514)
- Be Easy-to-Laugh (3515)
  - One surefire way to cultivate and radiate more of a Fun Mindset is to notice and appreciate the humor in everyday life. (3516)
  - In the words of former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, “The easiest way to have more humor…is not to try to be funny—instead, just look for moments to laugh.” (3519)
  - The easier you are to laugh (and the more things you can find to laugh about) the more attractive you’ll be, both to other people and to fun. (3522)
- Say “Yes, And” (3525)
  - In other words, even the nonactors among us can use the principle of “Yes, and” to build momentum and attract fun—whether by suggesting new things or by enthusiastically going along with other people’s ideas. (3554)
- Seek Absurdity (3559)
- Sprinkle In Playfulness, Connection, and Flow (3594)
  - regularly ask yourself, “How could I add a bit of playfulness, connection, or flow to whatever I’m doing or experiencing right now?” (3595)
  - The more you can cultivate a Fun Mindset in your everyday life, the lighter your everyday life will feel. (3609)
- Strengthen Your Play Muscles (3611)
  - 2020 paper published in Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being (3613)
  - Instead of writing down three good things, participants were asked to write down three playful moments from their day, as well as who had been involved and how they felt as a result. (3636)
  - And instead of finding opportunities to use their signature strengths, participants were asked to find opportunities to be playful in new ways, such as “doing something playful at the workplace.” (3637)
  - (They also asked participants to reflect on the number of playful experiences they’d had each day.) (3639)
- Send Out Play Signals (3643)
  - An example of a play signal in humans would be brief eye contact combined with a smile, or a comment that invites conversation. Even a playfully sarcastic line can work, such as “Nice weather we’re having” when you’re in the midst of a snowstorm. (3647)
  - Instead of sending play signals, we’re all staring down at our screens. With no signals, there are no invitations to play, and no play happens. Possible moments of play—and possible connections—are lost. (3651)
  - The resulting paper’s title—“Smartphones Reduce Smiles Between Strangers”—says it all. (3659)
  - In contrast, making a point to look up from your phone and send play signals is a wonderful way to invite more playful interactions—and ultimately, more fun and joy—into your life. (3664)
- Practice Presence (3669)
  - Someone who is fully present is someone people want to be around. (3674)
  - Indeed, researchers have found distraction to be one of the biggest negative influences on our moment-to-moment moods. (3676)
  - As we touched upon when we talked about making space for fun, you can train yourself to be more present through techniques such as mindfulness meditation or getting in the habit of doing just one thing at a time. (3681)
  - You can also learn to attract more fun simply by making a point to pay attention to other people when you’re with them. (3683)
- Seek Delight (3687)
  - This revelation—the more you focus on delight, the more delights will reveal themselves to you—echoes the same philosophy we’ve been talking about throughout this book: that our lives are what we pay attention to. (3700)
  - I mean, we point a finger at the thing in question—or, if it is not a physical “thing,” we raise a finger in the air—and announce, out loud and enthusiastically, “Delight!” (The out loud part is important, even if you are alone.) (3716)
- Savor What’s Good (3732)
  - When practiced over time, savoring has been shown not only to reliably boost people’s happiness but also to strengthen relationships, increase creativity, and even improve physical health. (3736)
  - For example, researchers who study savoring suggest focusing your attention on your present positive experience—in other words, catching yourself in a pleasant moment so that you can savor it on the spot. They also recommend tuning in to your senses and taking a mental photograph of the thing you’re trying to savor. (3739)
  - Positive psychologists have also found that, when you’re trying to savor something, it’s helpful to engage in what they call “behavioral displays”: expressing positive emotions with nonverbal behaviors, such as smiling—or, I’d argue, jutting a finger in the air as you label something a delight. (3742)
  - What’s more, experts who study savoring have found that telling other people about your positive event, a practice they call “capitalizing,” has an additional beneficial effect on your mood. (3744)
  - that I could turn to any time I needed a boost. (Looking back on your pleasant experiences is referred to as “positive mental time travel” and is another proven technique for improving your mood.) (3764)
- Put Yourself in Fun’s Way (3766)
  - If you become aware of a preexisting, fun-sounding event that you could attend, make it a priority to do so! (3772)
  - Also, I encourage you to make a habit of seeking out any situation in which you know that there will be a lot of playful energy, especially if you are not feeling full of playful energy yourself, because being around other people who are in good moods can be contagious. (3781)
- Be Able to Laugh at Yourself (3785)

### BUILD PLAYGROUNDS (3793)

- I’m talking about structures, either metaphorical or literal, that foster fun by encouraging playfulness, connection, and flow and that signal to people that it’s okay to let down their guard. (3796)
- as play scholar Miguel Sicart has pointed out, “play requires a certain element of design, material or contextual or both, so we know we can play, or be playful.” (3798)
- Well-designed playgrounds do just this: they invite playfulness, they offer clear rules and guidelines for how to behave within their walls, and they repel anti-fun factors such as self-consciousness and spoilsports—thereby protecting the people inside. (3799)
- What all playgrounds have in common is a structure, either explicit or implicit, that guides our behavior and gives us permission to behave in a playful way. (3817)
- Priya Parker points out in her excellent book, The Art of Gathering—namely, that “rules can create an imaginary, transient world that is actually more playful than your everyday gathering.” (3841)
- In short, well-constructed playgrounds create a sense of safety and belonging that allows us to let go and be playful. (3843)

#### How to Build a Playground (3845)

- Instead, she writes, “Gatherings crackle and flourish when real thought goes into them, when (often invisible) structure is baked into them, and when a host has the curiosity, willingness, and generosity of spirit to try.” They succeed, in other words, when their host has built a playground. (3854)
- If you’re not sure where to start or what type of playground best suits you, don’t obsess too much over the details. Just try something. (3872)
- As the Pie Madness tournament demonstrates, when a playground is successful, it is likely to turn into a tradition—and traditions themselves can spawn additional playgrounds that attract fun. (3879)
- Traditions can be particularly potent playgrounds because, in addition to attracting fun in the moment, they hold the potential to create a “play community” that, in the words of Johan Huizinga, “generally tends to become permanent even after the game is over.” (3886)

#### Choosing the Right Setting and Props (3893)

- sure enough, I noticed that several settings were mentioned repeatedly, (3905)
- I also noticed that, as Lee observed, certain objects tend to facilitate fun. (3910)

#### Protecting Your Playground (3923)

- As Huizinga explains it, “the spoil-sport shatters the play-world itself. By withdrawing from the game he reveals the relativity and fragility of the play-world in which he had temporarily shut himself with others. He robs play of its illusion—a pregnant word which means literally ‘in-play.’  (3932)
- When you’re organizing an event or building a playground, it’s important to go out of your way to make your guests feel comfortable and welcome. (3938)
- In other words, not only should you make a point to invite people whom you consider fun magnets, but you should reflect on who might be a possible spoilsport (or just not a good fit for the particular group or activity), and consider not inviting them. (3941)
- if you analyze your past experiences of fun, you may be surprised by how many of them do involve some sort of playground, even if it’s subtle, and how often your fun magnets are activities that, upon reflection, are not as loosey-goosey and organic as they might at first have seemed. (3949)

## Chapter 9: Rebel (4006)

- I mean committing acts of harmless rebellion in which you deliberately step outside the bounds of your “normal” life and do something different just for the fun of (4043)
- As play expert Stuart Brown writes, “Play, by its very nature…is about stepping outside of normal life and breaking some normal patterns. It is about bending rules of thought, action, and behavior.” (4048)
- If you’re a rule-following adult, the idea of being more rebellious might make you clench up. (4054)
- But here’s the thing: In the proper doses, irresponsibility and indulgence (and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones) are very good for us. (4056)
- The word “rebellion” itself means to wage war against something, which is a little violent for our purposes but highlights an important point: in order to rebel, you need to have something to rebel against. (4065)
- The first step is to identify what type of rebellion you enjoy. (4069)
- You can rebel against habits and routines. (4074)
- Not only will navigating your life on autopilot leave you with fewer memories, it will actually make time seem to speed up. (4083)
- Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as “dissociation,” and screens are a particularly powerful trigger for it. (4086)
- The best way to fight back and to slow down time is to focus on creating more opportunities for what scientists call “pattern separation”—in other words, finding ways to break up monotony. A life filled with new experiences and small rebellions can do just this. (4090)
- So, how do you rebel against habit and routine? The first step is to commit to embracing the Fun Mindset we discussed in the last chapter. Next, scan your life and take note of the things you do regularly out of habit—in other words, identify the areas of your life in which you’re on autopilot. Then you ask yourself a few times each day how you could mix things up. (4111)
- you can also rebel against habits simply by being flexible and saying “yes”—being the type of person often referred to as laid-back or easygoing (4119)
- you can rebel against convention. (4129)
- You can also use a rebellion against convention to surprise and delight people—and thus, add to their fun (as well as your own). (4133)
- You can rebel against traditions. (4154)
- The best traditions are the ones that you have consciously chosen or created. (4157)
- But creating traditions that are meaningful to you might require you to rebel. (4158)
- the act of rebelling as a group is an effective way to make the members of the group closer, (4168)
- You can rebel against beliefs—even your own. (4180)
- To do so, ask yourself why you believe something, and then question the validity of that belief. (4180)
- You can rebel against formality. (4191)
- Rebelling against formality means becoming more comfortable with who you actually are (and with sharing your authentic self with other people). (4194)
- You can start by scanning your life for situations in which you present an idealized version of yourself. (4196)
- You can rebel against adulthood. (4228)
- One way to do so is to join your children in play—to run through a fountain with them, or hop on a swing, or sign up for a class that you can do together. (4230)
- You also can make a point to seek out experiences that make you feel like a kid (in a good way). (4231)
- You can also rebel against adulthood by doing (harmless) things that would delight your teenage self. (4236)
- You can rebel against expectations, by doing something that contradicts your professional persona or that seems out of character—in (4241)
- You can also rebel against your expectations for yourself. (4249)
- For instance, if you are someone who lives mostly in their brain (i.e., if you’re like me), you can rebel by saying “no” to opportunities for yet more intellectual engagement, and instead do things that get you out of your head and back in touch with your senses. (4249)
- Speaking of perceived “shoulds,” you can rebel against your responsibilities and obligations and make a point of regularly doing things that are totally selfish. (4257)
- You may also want to ask yourself how you could create a rebellious experience for someone else. (4274)
- Anything you do with a child that makes you not seem like an adult is likely to delight them. And seeing their delight can help you realize how wonderful, rejuvenating, and important this type of rebellion can be—for children and adults. (4282)
- The more you approach life from this perspective, the more opportunities for playful rebellion you are likely to find. (4284)
- Experimenting with these types of rebellion can help us express our independence and autonomy, which is something that, ironic though it may seem, many adults do not often get a chance to do (especially the “responsible” ones). (4288)

## Chapter 10: Keep at It (4301)

- Orienting your life around fun is like exercise: it’s not something you can do once and then forget about. (4305)

### FIND YOUR FUN SQUAD(S) (4316)

- The most basic definition of a fun squad is simply people with whom you tend to have fun—in other words, they’re your human fun magnets. (4317)
- If you’re looking for additional ones, you can try inserting yourself into preexisting fun squads by, for example, joining an interest group or a team. (4320)
- You can also create a fun squad specifically for the purpose of finding new ways to have fun—sort of a meta-fun squad. (4321)
- Your new squad can be as small as just you and a friend, or as big as roughly six people; according to Priya Parker, author of The Art of Gathering, this size is particularly conducive to intimacy and high levels of sharing, which can be good ways to attract fun. (4328)
- I also recommend asking people to make a commitment of six months. (4329)
- In terms of purpose and structure, there are two main types of fun squads: the ones that meet to talk about fun and support each other as they reorient their lives around its pursuit, and ones that actually do stuff together. (4333)
- Figure out a regular time for your group to meet (whether in person or over video)—say, once every month—and use the time to share stories, come up with new ideas, and hold each other accountable. (4342)
- You also may want to rotate responsibilities in terms of who is officially in charge of leading the conversation when you meet. (4345)
- A fun squad that does stuff together is exactly what it sounds like, and can be a good choice for people who live relatively close to one another and who have similar fun factors. (4347)
- To establish a feeling of inclusion and gather a wide range of ideas, you may want to have each squad member come up with several ideas and then choose one idea from each person. (4350)
- You may want to consider alternating your meetings between trying something new as a group and simply getting together to hang out and talk, (4351)

### PRIORITIZE YOUR FUN MAGNETS (4364)

- Your leisure time is limited. Prioritize your fun magnets. (4366)

### PLAN FOR FUN (4367)

- First of all, if you don’t plan and protect opportunities to engage in your fun magnets, passions, interests, and hobbies, the rest of life will rush in and fill your time. (4369)
- Second, one of the main goals of “keeping at it” is to always have something on your calendar that you’re looking forward to, definitely every week and ideally every day. (4370)
- looking forward to things is a form of what psychologists call “anticipatory savoring,” which is pleasurable, boosts resilience, and lowers stress. (4372)
- So, how do you make sure that you always have something to look forward to? You put opportunities for fun on your calendar. (4375)

### MICRODOSES (4378)

- Microdoses are small, everyday pleasurable experiences that result in a feeling of playfulness, connection, and/or flow. (4378)
- recommend aiming to microdose on a fun-related activity at least several times a week, if not once a day. (4380)
- It’s possible to microdose spontaneously. (4381)
- To plan for microdoses, I recommend looking at your lists of fun magnets and seeing if you can regularly incorporate a few of them into your schedule. (4385)
- I also suggest that you set aside a time each day (even if it’s just ten minutes before bed) to indulge in a hobby, interest, or passion. (4387)
- Another way to microdose on fun is to deliberately seek out (and keep room on your schedule for) moments of playful rebellion, like making a weekly date for yourself where you sneak away from your desk in the middle of the day to go for a walk or meet a friend for lunch. (4390)
- Novelty can also help: some people microdose on fun by making a commitment to themselves to regularly try something new. (4392)
- You can also work microdoses into your life by scheduling opportunities for connection. (4394)

### BOOSTER SHOTS (4397)

- Booster shots are larger fun-oriented experiences, such as vacations or annual gatherings or events, that take more effort to schedule and plan for but that fill up your fun tank and replenish your energy for a longer period of time. (4398)
- Ideally, I recommend aiming to have at least one booster shot for every season, so that you always have one on the horizon. (4401)

### INVEST IN FUN (4406)

### USE TECHNOLOGY FOR GOOD (4422)

- The trick is to make sure that you’re using technology in a way that facilitates playfulness, connection, or flow—and that makes you feel engaged, rather than empty. (4426)

### COMMIT TO SCREEN-LIFE BALANCE (4448)

- One of my favorite ways to avoid falling prey to the worst parts of technology is to regularly take breaks from my devices. (4452)

### CONTINUE YOUR FUN TIMES JOURNAL (4474)

- You don’t have to write in it every day, but continuing the practice of jotting down experiences that brought you some combination of playfulness, connection, and flow can be a great way to keep the pursuit of fun a priority, track your progress, and identify new fun magnets (4475)

### BUILD A FUN TOOLKIT (4480)

- I suggest that you create a “fun toolkit”: a collection of ideas, prompts, and souvenirs that you can turn to any time you need inspiration or a pick-me-up. (4481)
- I personally recommend creating an actual, physical toolkit for fun. (4483)
- If you like this idea, get yourself some sort of aesthetically pleasing container. Next, collect your tools for creating, experiencing, and savoring moments of connection, playfulness, and flow. (4486)

### PUT WORK INTO FUN… (4501)

- you may need to continually convince or remind the other people in your life that fun is worth the investment, or even work with yourself to minimize your own anxiety and change your negative self-talk. (4509)

### …BUT DON’T TURN FUN INTO WORK (4512)

- It’s all too easy to turn the pursuit of fun into a homework assignment. (4514)
- This is why it is so important that you let go of the idea of quantifying or tracking fun in the same overachieving way that many of us count our steps— (4516)
- “Whenever we ‘track’ our leisure…we become hyperfocused on time efficiency. Instead of savoring our time, we worry about getting our money’s worth from our leisure time.” (4518)

### BE KIND TO YOURSELF (4522)

- Do not beat yourself up if, despite having followed every single suggestion in this book and having dutifully done every exercise, your life does not always feel fun. (4523)
- Some days you will have the energy and inspiration to create new opportunities for fun; some days you won’t. (4527)
- As you “keep at it,” you may notice that many of your everyday moments of playfulness, connection, and flow are small, fleeting, and unmemorable, to the point that you may wonder how much they matter. (4529)
- instead of focusing on intensity, seek abundance. (4532)
- Lastly, it’s also worth remembering that even in the most ideal of circumstances, developing a more fun-filled life isn’t going to happen overnight. (4534)

## Conclusion: The Power of Fun (4542)

- our lives are what we pay attention to. (4573)
- Our natural tendency is always going to be to pay attention to the negative, to scan the horizon for potential attacks. (4580)
- It also affects our experience of our lives: we pay far more attention to correcting what’s wrong—and finding problems that need to be “fixed”—than we do to enjoying and nurturing what is going right. (4584)
- Deciding what to do in this now is another way of asking ourselves what we want to pay attention to in the moment. (4596)
