Scaling Up Excellence tackles a challenge that confronts every leader and organization— spreading constructive beliefs and behavior from the few to the many.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 145

<div class="noteText">
Scaling well hinges on making the right trade- offs between mandating that new people and places become perfect clones of some original model (a “Catholic” approach) versus encouraging local variation, experimentation, and customization (a “Buddhist” approach).
</div>

The same lesson popped up each time: just making a rational argument about why people ought to spread some form of excellence was rarely sufficient to provoke them into action. Skilled leaders found ways to stoke emotions that fueled tangible and desirable actions.

The key lesson? An organization rarely loses a healthy mindset and the resulting excellence all at once. It usually happens via a series of small and seemingly innocent moves that chip away at sacred convictions, eventually transforming those beliefs into hollow and hypocritical words.

Accountability means that an organization is packed with people who embody and protect excellence (even when they are tired, overburdened, and distracted), who work vigorously to spread it to others, and who spot, help, critique, and (when necessary) push aside colleagues who fail to live and spread it. The trick— and it is a difficult trick— is to design a system where this tug of responsibility is constant, strong, and embraced by everyone, and where slackers, energy suckers, and selfish soloists have no place to hide.

As organizations grow larger and older, as the footprint of a program expands, and as the consequences of past actions accumulate, once useful but now unnecessary roles, rules, rituals, red tape, products, and services build up like barnacles on a ship; to make way for excellence to spread, these sources of unnecessary friction must be removed.

As Kahneman suggests, slowing down and thinking about what you are doing and why— shifting to that laborious, reasoned, deliberative, and conscious “System 2” thinking, as Kahneman calls it— is the best defense when “you are in a cognitive minefield”— when you don’t know enough, risks are high, or you are stuck.

Although there is no magic formula or instant cure that will make the vexing tensions and trade- offs vanish, the best leaders and teams stay on the lookout for signs of overkill. They search for signs of excessive “localization” or “standardization”— signs that it is time to move a little, or a lot, toward the other end of the continuum. We’ve identified three diagnostic questions that can help you detect when a move is wise, which direction to head, and how to make it happen.

Take the choice between going it alone versus working with partners. A partner can provide you with resources, expertise, and the ability to reach more people and establish more locations, which allows you to create a bigger footprint (and do it faster). But maintaining the purity of some original model is more difficult when your partner has a different history or different ideas, tastes, skills, and information than you have— as they always do. Partnerships generate Buddhist pressures.

Local leaders still had much leeway in what they did and how they did it.

As KP regional leaders discovered, it was easier, faster, and cheaper to imitate solutions that work elsewhere than to invent something from scratch every time. Liang’s team also enticed these leaders with incentives. Their policy was that, if a region elected to use software that was not common across KP, they would have to make and pay for it themselves, as well as required yearly updates. But if they adopted software that was standard throughout KP, then updates would be made and paid for by the national organization.

Short- term thinkers, those who agree with statements like “When someone presses me to change something, I tend to resist even if I think the change may ultimately benefit me.” 4. People who are “prone to cognitive rigidity,” who agree that “once I come to a conclusion, I am not likely to change my mind.”

These are the kinds of people that you ought to exclude from your scaling effort, at least in the early days. They will slow the effort, and, worse still, their fear and foot- dragging can spread to others like a contagious disease. Instead, you want people who get bored with stable routines, don’t stress out— or, better yet, take pleasure— from new challenges, have a penchant for long- term thinking, and are prone to change their minds when new information comes along. You want people who— even when they express skepticism or outright disbelief— still can’t resist the temptation to try something new, to make things a bit better for themselves and others, and who don’t freak out and freeze up when confronted with the confusion and dead ends that are inevitable as we learn new ways of thinking and acting.

As CALL’s success suggests, scaling hinges on discovering (or creating) pockets of excellence and connecting the people who have it, and their ideas and expertise, to others. When all goes well, a chain reaction occurs where excellence flows from one person, team, or place to the next— much like those “domino chains,” where the energy generated by one falling domino creates the energy to topple the next, and then the next, and so on, until all have fallen.

The connect- and- cascade process kicked in: as they helped colleagues in other disciplines solve problems, not only did these colleagues come to value the innovators’ knowledge and skills, but many learned and began applying the methods themselves.

Destructive mindsets often emerge when organizations use incentives meant to fuel good behavior— but when the easiest way (and sometimes the only way) to get those goodies is to do something bad. After a while, bad behavior doesn’t seem so wrong because everyone around you does it, they seem to encourage (or demand) that you do it, and you press others to sin along with you.

Whether you are doing something bad like giving people pay cuts or demotions, or something good like giving them raises and promotions, employees will work harder, go out of their way to do extra work, stay later, and be more loyal to you if you take the time to explain why your actions were necessary, talk to them about how these changes will unfold, and treat them with dignity along the way.

We also considered several overarching lessons under various guises, especially that the best leaders and teams treat scaling as a marathon rather than a sprint, are dedicated to gaining insights from every accomplishment and setback, and are driven by the nagging feeling that things are never quite good enough— by the “relentless restlessness” that Pixar’s Brad Bird pegged as a hallmark of organizations where, little by little, people keep getting better at what they do.

A scaling premortem works something like this: when your team is on the verge of making and implementing a big decision, call a meeting and ask each member to imagine that it is, say, a year later.

Split them into two groups. Have one group imagine that the effort was an unmitigated disaster. Have the other pretend it was a roaring success. Ask each member to work independently and generate reasons, or better yet, write a story, about why the success or failure occurred. Instruct them to be as detailed as possible and, as Klein emphasizes, to identify causes that they wouldn’t usually mention “for fear of being impolitic.”

Lack of ownership and weak pressures to do the right thing aren’t evident just when employees shirk from providing adequate customer service (or elect not to do so because doing nothing is safer than trying to do the right thing). It also happens when the game of work encourages every employee to look out for him- or herself and no one else; when pay and promotion are linked to selfish acts such as ignoring or even undermining colleagues, people learn that their success and security hinges on thinking first, last, and always of “me” rather than “we or us.” When that happens, ownership and feelings of mutual obligation evaporate, and unfortunate assumptions frame and fuel nearly everything that people do.
