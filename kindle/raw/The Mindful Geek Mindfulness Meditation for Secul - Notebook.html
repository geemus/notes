<div class="noteText">
We’ll leave aside any conjectures about “spiritual” improvement or growth as outside the scope of this book. Instead we’ll only look at things that benefit you in one or all of these practical ways. Is it making you happier, healthier, and more effective or not? Is it reducing stress, helping you sleep soundly, and improving your relationships, or not?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 423
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When you use meditation to become more aware of what you’re feeling, the unconscious or semi- conscious flavors of emotional experience begin to come into focus. Your own motivations and drives become clearer. Not just in a conceptual way, but in a way you can physically detect, moment by moment, throughout your day. This is the essence of emotional intelligence, and it is life changing.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 444

<div class="noteText">
There are many other possibilities, such as learning to consciously relax, learning to consciously appreciate external sensory perception, learning to consciously experience pleasure, and more.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 457
</div>
<div class="noteText">
I feel something similar about meditation practice. Meditation teaches you to examine your everyday sensory experience very closely. The insights into your own motivations, drives, and behavior you get from doing that regularly is quite illuminating and helpful in your life. I call this feature of meditation the “under the hood” benefit.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 492

<div class="noteText">
Whatever you focus your attention on, regularly over time, will change the brain itself— physically alter it, some parts becoming larger or smaller— to get better at processing the thing you’re focusing on.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 546
</div>
<div class="noteText">
mindfulness meditation is a psychological technique that involves paying attention to your present- moment sensory experience in a nonjudgmental manner, and which makes the unconscious conscious for the purpose of improving your life.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 555

The goal is not to empty your mind of thoughts; the goal is to pay attention to some aspect of your current sensory experience.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 563
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The second misconception is that meditation is something that is supposed to be blissful or pleasurable.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 575
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Mindfulness meditation involves paying attention to your present- moment sensory experience in a nonjudgmental way. It doesn’t mean stopping thinking, emptying your mind, or feeling blissful. Thoughts and negative feeling are fine, if they arise.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 585

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 587

These insights may be utterly quotidian at this point, or they may not. Not every insight will be earth- shattering. Many of them are mundane, but as a group, as a body of knowledge, they slowly add up to something useful.

CHAPTER FOUR

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 745

By giving a name to your experience, you can begin to get a handle on it, a new ability to understand and cope with it.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 749
</div>
<div class="noteText">
First, remember that meditation is not about clearing your mind of thoughts. Second, labeling is a great ally in meditation and is a standard feature of mindfulness practice. Distracted thoughts pull your attention away from the object of your meditation, but labeling helps to focus your attention on it.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 752
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The labels also tend to fill up the mental talk channel with calm, neutral words, rather than agitated, unpleasant words, which also enhances the effects of meditation. There is some interesting research evidence that suggests that the process of labeling in meditation (particularly labeling affect, or feeling tone) increases the potency of mindfulness’s beneficial effects.[
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 762

Let’s look at how to label correctly and how to avoid the most common pitfalls.

Be Gentle

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 780
</div>
<div class="noteText">
But meditation shouldn’t be speedy and frantic like that. Instead, allow a single label to count for several instances of similar objects arising. Keep the speed down to something like one label every few seconds. More than that can feel too busy and disrupt the focusing effect of the labeling.

The most common mistake, and the most ironic, is getting caught up in the idea that you’re messing it up.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 813

<div class="noteText">
A second problem is letting yourself become grossly distracted.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 817

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 820

<div class="noteText">
The third common problem is falling asleep.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 825

A fourth common problem is trying too hard.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 830
</div>
<div class="noteText">
A fifth common problem is stopping the meditation before you’re finished. Usually this happens because you just can’t stand to sit anymore. You feel too upset, anxious, busy, distracted, or bored to keep going, and so you give up before the timer rings.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 834
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The secret to being able to stay sitting when you feel like you just can’t stay sitting is this: meditate on the reaction that’s trying to catapult you out of your seat.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 838
</div>
<div class="noteText">
With practice, meditating on the reaction to the meditation can significantly deepen your meditation, as well as keep you seated for the allotted time.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 839

The last common problem is a little subtler: entertaining yourself with a slew of different meditation techniques.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 845

<div class="noteText">
If you want to switch techniques in different sessions, that’s fine, but don’t give in to the urge to jump from technique to technique in a single session.

In order to meditate, it helps to sit with your back upright.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 868

Beyond that, being as comfortable as possible is important. Once you’re sitting in your meditation posture, refrain from outright fidgeting.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 878

Remaining physically still creates a feedback loop with your mind and allows your thoughts to settle down. There are other factors as well, such as the fact that it’s much easier to meditate on subtle body sensations when you’re not moving around.

CHAPTER SIX
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 890

<div class="noteText">
In meditation class, we also begin with a concept of three separate but interconnected pieces: concentration, sensory clarity, and acceptance (CCA).
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 893
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Concentration means being able to train your attention on whatever object you choose, and sustain it there over time.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 894
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Sensory clarity means having a lot of resolution of the details of whatever object you’re focusing on.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 896
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Acceptance means having an attitude of openness, curiosity, and nonjudgment with whatever is happening in the moment.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 900
</div>
<div class="noteText">
If even one of these elements is a little bit present, you can have a decent meditation.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 910
</div>
<div class="noteText">
If two or three of the elements are strong, then your meditation experience will usually be quite good. Developing all three is the key to strengthening and deepening your meditation practice.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 915
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Concentration, or focus, means that you can direct your attention to the object you choose, and hold it there. The better your concentration, the longer you can hold it without interruption.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 935
</div>
<div class="noteText">
It’s natural and even healthy that, in the beginning, your attention is going to be captured by things that are not your meditation object.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 938
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The solution is simple: brute force repetition. Each time your attention is drawn away from the meditation object, gently bring it back. Over and over, notice that your focus has wandered and return it to the chosen object. Each one of these returns can be thought of as a concentration “rep,” just like a weightlifting “rep” at the gym.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 950
</div>
<div class="noteText">
So this sort of iteration increases the time dimension of your concentration. Your attention span gets huge.[
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 957

<div class="noteText">
Gaining the ability to focus on anything you want to, for as long as you want, is one of the most powerful ways the mindfulness meditation can improve your life.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 965
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Sensory clarity takes a while to develop and requires that you attempt to make ever- finer sensory distinctions in your meditation practice.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 999
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Sensory clarity is wonderful for other senses, too. Imagine gazing at your favorite works of art (or other beautiful objects) with eyes that have developed a high degree of visual resolution. It’s like HD for your eyes, or listening to your favorite music with super- attuned hearing. Even your senses of taste and smell can vastly improve with sensory clarity.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1005

Acceptance is extremely simple, much simpler than the other two. Just accept whatever your experience is, that’s all.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1009

The motto for acceptance is, “It is what it is.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1010

<div class="noteText">
It’s important to notice that acceptance means accepting your sensory experience, not accepting the conditions of your life.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1013

<div class="noteText">
Acceptance will not only deepen your meditation practice considerably, it will also alter your life in other ways.[ 54] When you quit resisting everything all the time, things can become easier and more enjoyable for you very quickly.

Just as concentration can be expressed as an algorithm, the process of mindfulness meditation can also be modeled as a repeated sequence of steps. This algorithm assumes that you’ve already sat down, relaxed, and gotten all set to meditate.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1046

<div class="noteText">
1. Notice the focus object. 2. Label the focus object. 3. Allow awareness to deeply contact the focus object. 4. Feel acceptance toward whatever you find there. 5. Continue focusing, contacting, and accepting for about 5 seconds. 6. Repeat.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1093

<div class="noteText">
You’ve got to put in the time doing the tiny steps, to make sure you’re getting the full benefit. Eventually, these steps will unfold all at once, like one big Step 5, and it will feel as if you’ve been doing it for your whole life, like you were born to meditate. And that, my friend, will feel good.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1108

<div class="noteText">
“Contacting it deeply” means to actively explore your focus object with a lot of curiosity. You definitely do not want to let Step 2 be the end of the process. Here, we’re using the label as a signal to dig more deeply into the richness and depth of the experience. You want to get the sense that awareness is caressing, investigating, even permeating the focus object.

It may seem like it’s possible to take this too far, and you may be tempted to just sort of ballpark it. I mean, pay attention to every little detail of sensation in your hand? Really? But the secret to success with sensory clarity is to take it too far, take it way, way too far.

The more you gently stretch yourself in the effort to investigate ever- subtler details of sensation, the more you’re building the part of your brain (the insula) which allows you to feel your own body. It takes effort, but the effort is not wasted.

The fundamental aspect of a nervous system, whether that of a snail, a fish, a parrot, or a human being, is that it functions as a behavioral guidance system. It orients you toward food, shelter, mates— things that help with survival— and away from predators, cliffs, and poisons— things that do you in.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1195

In animals with nervous systems, this behavioral guidance is subjectively experienced as signals of pleasure and pain.

<div class="noteText">
The biological wisdom[ 61] built into the nervous system is the result of millions of years of evolution— which things are pleasant and which cause pain are usually things that are survival- positive and survival- negative, respectively.[ 62]
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1210

Recent research seems to indicate the core of this pleasure/ pain learning system is centered in the structure known as the amygdala.[ 63]

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1237

In mindfulness meditation, the general stance is to attempt to accept and investigate all sensory experience, regardless of its hedonic tone.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1239
</div>
<div class="noteText">
There are several good reasons to do this.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1240
</div>
<div class="noteText">
One is that it’s hard to investigate experiences that you are avoiding, suppressing, or denying.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1242
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Given that pain signals are just as valuable behaviorally as pleasure signals, this is in itself interesting and useful.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1244
</div>
<div class="noteText">
A second reason is related to the first— you can get large insights by looking into painful sensations (especially very minor ones).
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1246
</div>
<div class="noteText">
A third reason is that our avoidance of pain signals, and the underlying conviction we have that they are bad, actually makes them worse.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1249

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1252

The good news is that the opposite is also true— positive emotional experiences can make physical pain much less intense— and we can use this fact to our advantage in meditation.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1271

And what about pleasurable sensations? How should you encounter those in meditation? For one, you are encouraged to enjoy them to their fullest. You can do this deeply by using concentration (to focus on them specifically) and sensory clarity (to get into the fine details of the pleasure), and— as usual— by accepting whatever you experience.

We are trying to do too much, too fast, all at once, and are living in a state of chronic stress as a result.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1313

<div class="noteText">
Stress activates a part of the neuroendocrine system called the hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal (HPA) system.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1318

The HPA system evolved to cope with immediate survival threats.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1320
</div>
<div class="noteText">
First, the HPA system manufactures and releases steroid hormones, called glucocorticoids, including the main stress hormone, cortisol. Cortisol is a crucial chemical for arousing the body to deal with danger (to run away from the tiger that you’ve spotted). It activates the heart, lungs, circulation, metabolism, immune systems, and skin, and prepares them to help you run away as fast as you can.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1324
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The HPA system also releases neurotransmitters called catecholamines, particularly dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline. Catecholamines suppress the activity of the frontal lobes of your brain, making simple decision- making easier (fight or flight, anyone?), but hindering social interaction and complex task solving. They also trigger the amygdala— an area of the brain associated with an emotional response, usually fear— to have an appropriate response. These neurotransmitters then signal the hippocampus to store the fear and other data about the experience in long- term memory so that you know how to survive a tiger attack next time, if you survive.[ 69]
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1340
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Nature has also developed a second response whose job it is to turn off all these intense reactions and return your body to normal after the tiger has slinked off seeking easier prey. This is called the relaxation response, and it resets the body to its pre- emergency state.

If you really want to become mindful of body sensations, you have to learn to understand the language of the body. And what the body says in its native language may be very different from the things the mind says about it.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1663

For example, we all have a mental image of the size of our various body parts, and a mental image about the size of the body in general. Yet often in mindfulness meditation, the body or parts of the body can feel larger or smaller than the mind knows them to be.

In the context of meditation practice, you can think of two kinds of acceptance.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1870
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Acceptance One is experienced in the body as some degree of physical relaxation.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1871
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Acceptance Two is experienced in the mind, as a lack of psychological resistance.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1874
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Of course, these two aren’t literally different, but thinking about them this way can be helpful.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1875
</div>
<div class="noteText">
It’s fortunate that there are two different types of acceptance available, because it gives you two different routes into the experience of acceptance. Even if your mind is filled with negative, difficult thoughts, you can often at least get your body to relax (Acceptance One). On the other hand, if your body is tensing up against something (usually pain, but also in disgust about something, etc.) you can find some acceptance in your thoughts about the object (Acceptance Two). Usually, if you can fire up one form of acceptance even a bit, the other one will eventually start coming online also.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1904
</div>
<div class="noteText">
As with acceptance, there are two kinds of resistance: physical and psychological. Your body tends to tense up all around the painful area. Then you think thoughts about how unfair the pain is, how much you want to escape it, how much you do/ don’t deserve it, and so on.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1913
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The equation is simple: P x R = S, or “pain times resistance equals suffering.” This means that your level of suffering from pain is dependent upon how much you can let go of resisting it. In other words, relief from pain is all about how much you can accept the pain.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1938
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Here’s how you work with it. Let’s say you’re meditating on body sensation, and you’re feeling some physical pain. If you want to work with it, begin meditating on the pain sensation. Notice it, label it, contact it deeply (and gently), and accept it completely. Let it be whatever it is. Concentrate on it, and examine its sensory qualities. Where it feels like it is, the physical extent of it, its three dimensional shape. And so on.

Emotions rule your life. Based on that fact alone, understanding the background and function of emotions is clearly of supreme importance. The clearer picture you have of emotions, the clearer picture you have of your entire life, and mindfulness meditation is a very effective method for gaining clarity and insight about your emotions.

<div class="noteText">
This way of looking at emotions is so useful that there is a short mnemonic I want you to use whenever you’re trying to understand an emotion that you’re experiencing: just say to yourself “guidance system.” It forces you to look at an emotion for what it really is: an evolved response. In this sense, there’s no such thing as a positive or negative emotion.

Fear gets you away from dangerous situations. Anger defends something you want, or drives away something you don’t want.

Pride, on the other hand, signals to the group that we did something right, and we’re showing off how great we are. It’s intended to up our status in the group, as well as to encourage group cohesion by showing what is correct or rewardable behavior.

In most mindfulness meditation, the idea is to accept what you’re feeling, and to greet all emotions with curiosity, openness, and nonjudgment. Even if they are painful and negative, you investigate them in detail. Sometimes, however, digging directly into a big, difficult emotion just isn’t possible or desirable— it might be too gnarly to deal with effectively, like in Roy Batty’s situation.

Hopefully these are not common occurrences in your life, but they do happen to all of us sometime, and it’s important to know how to cope. In all of these cases, meditating directly on the intense feelings of emotion in the body may not be the best course of action.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 2380

That means that other areas are much less likely to host gigantic emotional sensations, which turns out to be a useful and convenient thing. You can meditate on those emotionally “cold” spots, such as your hands and feet, and stay in touch with your body.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 2385

Intense emotions can be seductive, even if they are unpleasant. They are like whirlpools that suck your attention toward them, so avoid allowing yourself to be drawn into the emotional hotspots. Just stay focused on your hands and feet. This is an effective way to work with big feelings.

I said that there were two techniques, but I’ll toss in a third for free. It’s called pendulation, and it’s slightly more difficult than the above techniques. It often takes some previous experience of focusing on a neutral spot. If you can do pendulation, however, it’s worth it.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 2410
</div>
<div class="noteText">
To pendulate, you first locate an emotional- neutral spot in the body and meditate on it for a little while. The next step is the tough one. If you have a huge emotion occurring, but you think you can contact it, or contact somewhere near it, without getting totally overwhelmed, then do that. Contact some part of the huge emotion and meditate on that for a very brief time. If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, immediately come back to the neutral spot.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 2413

Flow does involve work, but it is work that you like doing and can do well. If a challenge is too difficult, frustration and disappointment arise, and that blocks the flow state. Flow has to involve a task you can actually achieve. On the other hand, if the task is too easy, it doesn’t capture your attention, and flow cannot happen either. You get bored and float away into distraction. In between anxiety when the task is too hard, and boredom when it’s too easy, there is a Goldilocks zone for the flow state; a condition of a task that is just right.

It’s one of the secrets to making meditation work for you in life: make the effort to meditate on things that are just slightly too hard for your focus ability. This stretches your capacity to handle the anxiety of a task that’s a little hard. Alternately, you can sometimes go back to meditating on something you find intrinsically boring. By maintaining curiosity and interest with a boring focus object, you will discover that it begins to become strangely interesting.

Paying close attention even when you feel bored expands your flow channel, making it wider until it becomes quite easy to get into a flow state.

By adjusting your concentration in this way to achieve this state, everything you do all day can become more fun, interesting, and fulfilling.

To really listen, you use your concentration skills on the sounds of speech entering your ears. You listen to your conversation partner’s words as if listening to a favorite song, with your mind focused on what they are saying and what it means.

Practicing the FOP technique has a calming effect on the nervous system, significantly reducing stress. One study[ 109] found that doing just 10 minutes of it (with no history of practice) increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and decreased respiratory rates in participants, both indicators of relaxation, and another[ 110] showed clear reduction in the immune and behavioral responses indicative of stress. A more far- reaching study[ 111] found that women who had done a significant amount of FOP over time had significantly longer telomere length— a key indicator of longevity— compared to controls, even when levels of past trauma and depression were taken into account.

<div class="noteText">
Some of the most exciting current neuroscience looks into the question of what the brain does when it’s not involved in any particular task. There are colloquial terms for this state of mind, like “daydreaming” or being “checked out,” but in neuroscience it’s called “mind wandering.” Through the use of fMRI, scientists have discovered that there is a specific brain network dedicated to this mode of processing. And in a fascinating experiment, they found out something surprising: most of us are checked out about half of the time.[
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3410
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The data revealed something important to us in terms of wellbeing: people were on average least happy during mind wandering, and this was true no matter what activity they were doing.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3413

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3421

Scientists have discovered that there is a brain network associated with mind wandering, and have named it the default mode network (DMN), since mind wandering seems to be our default setting.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3428
</div>
<div class="noteText">
To describe it generously, we might say that the default mode network is concerned with evaluating the outcomes of past actions and using that as a basis for planning future actions. In fact, such evaluation and planning is probably the intended function of the default mode network in the brain.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3434

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3442

For one thing, it suggests that the brain is never actually at rest.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3451
</div>
<div class="noteText">
A second question revolves around the fact that studies have shown that increased activity and connectivity in the DMN is directly correlated with difficult mental afflictions, such as such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and obsession.[
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3461
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The complexity of our current environment requires a quantity and intricacy of planning that is likely far beyond anything ever needed in the past. So it’s not that evolution selected for mental illness, it’s that we didn’t evolve to live in a world this labyrinthine, entangled, and interconnected.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 3465

Luckily, meditation allows you to correct for this over- activity by purposefully down- regulating the DMN, as we’ll see.

But there is a second kind of attention in which you don’t try to control which object you’re paying attention to at all. You allow your attention to wander wherever it likes.
