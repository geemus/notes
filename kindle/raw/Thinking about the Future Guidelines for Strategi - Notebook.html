Strategic foresight mediates two types of relationships, which might be termed translation and transformation.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Framing >  Page 65
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Translation involves translating “outside and then” so that it can be used to improve the organization’s existing policies, strategies, and plans— its “inside and now.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Framing >  Page 65
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Transformation involves transforming the identity of the organization by reshaping its purpose, niche, or identity, using what’s learned from “outside and then” to transform “inside and now.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Framing >  Page 66
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The simplest way to assess the capacity for transformation is to ask the six questions set out by Beck and Cowan in Spiral Dynamics (1996): Does the potential exist for people to think differently? Do solutions exist for unresolved problems? Is there sufficient dissonance about the present? Is there insight about alternatives? Are the barriers to transformation identified and addressable? Is support available during transformation? If all six are not present, then don’t try transformation.

Disagreements arise from two sources— differences in information and knowledge and differences over fundamental assumptions or values. Both are important sources of new learning.

Jim Collins (2001: 73– 80) suggests four guidelines for creating “a climate where the truth is heard” once the objective is established and everyone agrees to work for it: Lead with questions, not answers. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion. Conduct autopsies, without blame. Build “red flag” mechanisms (i.e., ways for people to raise objections without penalty).

Strategy expert Gary Hamel (2003) suggests creating a “marketplace for ideas” within the organization— essentially, bringing the concept of venture capitalism inside. For example, managers could be given the opportunity to spend a small percentage of their budgets each year on any in- house project of interest to them, anywhere in the organization.

Most people have a more diverse view of the future than they usually talk about, because our culture discourages people from sharing forecasts that are not likely.

<div class="noteText">
Uncovering hidden assumptions is essential to first- rate foresight work. Hidden assumptions often lie at the root of strategic foresight gone awry; that is, plans fail because an unstated assumption turns out to be incorrect. Even more insidiously, an analyst or other member of the foresight team will unconsciously gravitate to evidence that supports a hidden assumption, or ignore evidence that contradicts it.

Now identify assumptions about the behavior of the key players and forces. One way to do this is to imagine being granted three questions of someone who knows what the future will be, with each answer costing $ 100,000.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Visioning >  Page 235

A core role for analysts who help organizations focus on change is to examine and challenge the official future. In strategic discussions this means discovering and discussing a group’s assumptions about the future.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Visioning >  Page 236
</div>
<div class="noteText">
First, get everyone involved to air their views on the future of the question at hand. Bringing out tacit assumptions immediately invites scrutiny of them. Through the ensuing discussion, colleagues will begin to challenge each other’s assumptions as well as their own.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Visioning >  Page 236

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Planning >  Page 275

<div class="noteText">
First, the mental models of the organizations need to be surfaced through interviewing.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Planning >  Page 275

These views can then be “scaffolded” by connecting and integrating them.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Planning >  Page 276

<div class="noteText">
In particular, the facilitator needs to know how to employ the scaffolding process. The conversation should be facilitated— not chaired— and group dynamics optimized.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Planning >  Page 276

<div class="noteText">
It is also recommended to avoid normative thinking (what an individual wants to happen) and instead focus on what might happen.

<div class="noteHeading">

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Planning >  Page 278

While acknowledging that the environment is changing and the organization’s strategy needs to be revised, the analyst first needs to see— and to help others see— that a preoccupation with “what will change” could lead to futures that nobody will want.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Planning >  Page 279

Assuming there are four potential choices facing the team and clients, the options range as follows, from safest to riskiest: A robust strategy looks for elements common to all four options and focuses on these commonalities. A hedge- your- bets strategy gives equal weight to all four options; that is, it assumes all four are equally viable and divides the action equally across them. A core- satellite strategy emphasizes one option as the most likely and pays the most attention to it, but also pays lesser attention to the other options just in case.

Second, it is important to find one or more relevant unlikely ideas (not all unlikely ideas qualify for further analysis).

Most system variables operate in range around some relatively stable equilibrium point. When the range increases (turbulence or volatility) or the equilibrium point shifts, the system can approach some boundary beyond which it moves to a completely different structure and equilibrium point.

In fact, the best monitoring program uses indicators that are obvious, or at least so easy to understand and collect that it is obvious what is occurring as soon as the data appears. Otherwise the activity might be judged superfluous and will not— and should not— be continued.

The first question is, “How will the organization know when one or another alternative is actually happening?” In other words, “What would happen first, second, and third were this alternative to actually unfold?” The answers are the raw material for leading indicators.
