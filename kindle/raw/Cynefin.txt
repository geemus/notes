When we are faced with a problem, we assume that all we need to do is elaborate the options, select one, and then execute. This assumes that causality is determinable and therefore that we have a valid means of eliminating options.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)

This is not always the case and we need to acknowledge that there are systems in which we can determine cause and effect and those in which we cannot. We call the former ordered and the later un-ordered1 systems
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 85-88 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:38:45 AM

In an ordered system, the system is highly constrained, the behaviour is highly predictable, and the causality is either obvious from experience or can be determined by analysis. If the cause is obvious then we have a simple system, and if it is not obvious but can be determined by analysis, we say it is a complicated system as cause and effect (or determination of the cause) is separated by time.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 89-89 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:39:07 AM

For an un-ordered system, we cannot determine causality.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 89-92 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:39:22 AM

However, we find that some of these systems are stable, and the constraints and behaviour evolve over time through the interaction of the components. They are dispositional in nature — that is, they are disposed to move or evolve in a certain direction — but causality can only be determined in hindsight, and no amount of analysis will allow us to predict the behaviour of the system. This domain, we call complex.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 92-93 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:39:35 AM

But there are also some systems that are not stable and which we can only described as chaotic: there are few to no constraints, and behaviour is random.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 93-94 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:39:40 AM

There is one additional domain that needs to be considered: systems that we have not yet determined — we put these in the “disorder” bucket.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 95-97 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:40:08 AM

We can apply another definition to systems that are ordered as we can take them apart and put back together again — for example, a car or an aeroplane; those that are un-ordered can never be deconstructed then put back together. For example, think of making mayonnaise.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 97-98 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:40:19 AM

We also need to acknowledge that systems are not always stable and the state of the system may change over time.

Obvious3 (known knowns): Here, we know what we are doing and have seen it a thousand times before, so we sense, categorise, and respond (S-C-R). We expect to see best practices employed.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 111-112 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:41:25 AM

Complicated (known unknowns): We don’t know what is going on but we know that we can analyse what has happened and work it out, so we sense, analyse, and respond (S-A-R). This is the domain of good practice.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 113-116 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:41:41 AM

Complex (unknown unknowns): We cannot determine what will cause a particular outcome but we can run some experiments to see if they move us in the right direction, so we probe, sense, and respond (P-S-R). This is also the domain of multiple hypotheses: there is no right or wrong answer, so we may want to run a series of experiments or run a number in parallel. This is the domain of emergent practice.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 116-118 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:41:54 AM

Chaotic (unknowable unknowns): Here, the system is not stable but we need to do something as it is not viable to wait, so we act (do something), sense, and respond (A-S-R). This is the domain of novel practice.
==========

==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 124-126 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:43:14 AM

The first thing we need to do is to differentiate between order and un-order: have we seen this before or have any experience that can be leveraged? If so, then the problem is ordered. If we haven’t seen this before and it is truly novel, then this is something that we may be better off exploring first; therefore, we treat it as un-ordered.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 126-128 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:43:32 AM

If there is no time to consider the domain in which we are operating, then we should consider the worst case, not the most simple — which means that if is ordered, then deal with it as complicated and engage experts and if it is un-ordered, then treat it as chaotic and act in an attempt to stabilise the situation.

The issue with the complicated domain, the domain of experts, is that there is a tendency towards groupthink.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 139-140 | Added on Friday, May 15, 2020 6:44:41 AM

The issue of groupthink can be addressed by engaging diverse groups of individuals and ensuring that some of these come from other domains of expertise and therefore provide a naive view.

Again, naivety has a role to play as we cannot assume that we know what will happen. As long as someone can make a coherent argument, their idea has value and should be explored.

Obliquity: The last point to make is that of the need to recognise the value of obliquity, which is the practice of achieving objectives indirectly.

What we ideally want to use is an oblique approach, as this avoids the cognitive bias that comes from using a traditional measure that can be gamed. This is explored in John Kay’s excellent Obliquity: Why Our Goals Are Best Achieved Indirectly.

It is an oblique technique as the user is not asked direct questions, which ensures more openness and honesty.

A second advantage of narrative enquiry is that it can exploit self-signification of the stories, which guards against the facilitators or other parties biasing the results (this supports the principle of disintermediation).

- Your Highlight on Location 211-213 | Added on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 3:15:59 PM

In a traditional analysis approach, once we have conducted one or two interviews, human biases come into play as we start to look for stories or requirements that confirm the themes that we are seeing (this is confirmation bias at work).
==========

The use of stories allows people to access thoughts and feelings that are otherwise not available to them. This is because some knowledge is tacit in nature, meaning that a person doesn’t know it until they need it (Polanyi, 2009).

At the group level, we need to consider the dynamics, and groups should be seven to twelve members large (see the “Shared context and sense making” section for a discussion of group sizes). In addition, we ideally want to record the conversation and transcribe it.

The Cynefin framework can be used in different ways: for categorisation, which is useful from a situational perspective; for contextualisation, which is useful in establishing a checkpoint and deciding what we want to do; and from a dynamics perspective – we are here and need to move to here, so this the journey that we need to consider.

A shared context is developed by contextualisation — that is, establishing the issues that exist in this environment and how they relate. We are using Cynefin to develop this understanding of the issues so we are assuming that we are largely aware of the issues; there may be an issue log or list of questions that we are looking to make sense of.

The ideal group size for this exercise is seven to twelve.4 Nancy Kline (1999) mentions that twelve is as large a group as we want, as this is the size of group in which people are still comfortable expressing themselves. Similarly, we don’t want a lot of small groups as we want to encourage diversity; don’t form groups any smaller than seven members as a general rule.

Position the issues on the wall based on association with the exemplars. This is not an absolute position but based on how we think each issue relates to each of the exemplar narratives. I must stress that we should not allow people to place an issue directly on any corner

You will recall from the first section that complex systems are dispositional in nature, meaning that they are disposed to move or evolve in a certain direction, but we cannot determine causality so the only way we can manage this type of system is by probing, sensing, and responding. That is, we run a series of experiments to see if we can move the system in a direction that is desirable or beneficial to us.

Obvious — Just do it, as you have seen it before and it should be obvious what needs to be done (this is after all the criterion for it being classified as obvious). It should just be a case of what resources are needed and whether you have them.3
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 454-455 | Added on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 4:49:48 PM

Complicated — You need to involve a group of experts or knowledgeable individuals to undertake the analysis. Remember to engage related experts to honour the principle of requisite diversity and to bring naive views to bear to avoid groupthink.
==========
Cynefin (Greg Brougham)
- Your Highlight on Location 456-458 | Added on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 4:50:11 PM

Complex — What are the viable (that is, coherent) hypotheses and therefore what are the experiments that we are proposing? Remember, this is the domain of messy coherence and therefore we cannot predict the outcome, so we need to undertake a series of experiments to see if we can move in a desired direction (this being where you want to move or at least start to progress towards).

Chaotic — This is not often encountered during planning as this is normally a dynamic state that doesn’t exist for long. We want to do something to move the problem into the complex or complicated domain so that we can start to get a handle on it.4 Remember, we approach this domain based on act-sense-respond, so someone just needs to propose an action and then we go from there.

The ideas behind the practice are similar to neuroscientist Vincent Walsh’s idea of trashing, in which a proposal is rigorously critiqued to ensure that it is fully formed. This practice ensures an objective review of the idea and removes the subjectivity.

To improve information scanning, we want to ensure requisite diversity by engaging people who are not familiar with the domain.

This is the domain of multi-hypotheses so we expect there to be more than one by the nature of the domain. Remember that any idea that appears coherent may have value and should be evaluated.

The objective is not to determine what should be done but what probes (experiments) would help clarify the situation.

If we have the opportunity, we can ask people what would need to be true to support the hypothesis. This moves them away from thinking of barriers and allows us to start looking at what we need to invalidate an idea, as these are just the opposites of what it would take for it to be true.

The presenter has a few minutes to outline the initiative during which no other person is allowed to speak.

Once finished, the presenter disengages from the group by hiding their face — donning a mask, if available, or turning their chair so that their back faces the group.

The group members may now express their views of the idea, particularly what is wrong with it, and they should not hold back as this is about ensuring that all aspects are covered.

Again, this is not a debating forum so only one person at a time should speak until each has voiced all their concerns

During this, the presenter takes notes of the points raised for consideration in a revision of the initiative. We are trying to ensure that the initiative is reviewed objectively and the individual is not involved.

When the group has finished expressing concerns, the presenter takes the ideas back to the original group or goes off to revise the proposal to address the points that have been made.

This simple practice takes advantage of the expertise and knowledge of the organisation to ensure that any initiative is well formed and has been objectively reviewed before presenting it to management for sponsorship.

It is not the function of the reviewers to reject proposals, which is the prerogative of management, but to improve them.

The outcome of the initiative review is likely to be a series of robust initiatives that should be considered for implementation.

We may have to address a series of strategic themes, business priorities, and ensure that the initiatives are balanced and not biased towards one particular area. Also, if we are dealing with complex issues, we want to have multiple initiatives. In the complicated domain, it may be more straightforward as there is likely to be only a single initiative within a theme, but there may be multiple competing ideas from different teams or areas of the business, and we should explore these. These are only elements that need to be considered as part of each organisation’s approach to exploiting Cynefin.

This gives rise to two situations where moving between domains is of value: one where we want to move from exploitation to exploration and the other where we want to increase the organisational agility (rate of change).

In the first case (marked A in the diagram above), we have encountered a problem that is messy in nature.2 We may or may not realise that this is complex in nature but we would benefit from dealing with it as complex as we can use probes to see if we can move the situation in a desirable direction.

If there are competing hypotheses, we should explore all of them, so the path from complicated into complex may split into multiple paths of exploration.

The resulting series of safe-to-fail probes will then lead to a series of options that may be then exploited in an ordered domain.

In the second case (B), where we want to create a change in an organisation, we can move the issue intentionally (or let it collapse) into a chaotic state.

This is more a challenging art than a science, but we are looking to enter a shallow dive through chaos to invoke a change of direction for the organisation.

The thing to realise is that the chaotic element needs to be contained and we need to look to move out of this domain as quickly as possible.

What I find useful is to use this to explore the direction that we want to take and then use complex domain practices to explore the competing hypotheses.
