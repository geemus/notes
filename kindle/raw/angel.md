# Angel: How to Invest in Technology Startups—Timeless Advice from an Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000 by Jason Calacanis
- Angel investing is the act of putting money into the earliest investment rounds of a private business with the goal of getting back more money than you put in—much more than you can return in a safer, more established investment vehicle. [220]
- If a company isn’t venture backed, it could just end up a profitable, sustainable business that sends its investors dividend checks. But angels and venture investors hate that. We want exits and returns. [232]
- While it’s unlikely you’ll hit a return of five thousand to ten thousand times your investment, like I did, it’s very possible—maybe probable if you do all the work—that if you operate for a couple of years, here in Silicon Valley, making fifty or one hundred individual investments, you will return more money than you put in. [263]
- Even if you just make back the money you invested in a hundred startups, you will have been able to hang out with the most driven and creative people in the world, building an exceptional personal network, and learning a shit ton. [265]
- While it’s totally crazy to make each of these bets on an individual basis, it’s even crazier to not make one hundred of them. [268]
- The answer is simple: if a startup in which you are an early enough investor becomes a unicorn—a company valued at $1 billion—you will return life-changing money. [294]
- Pro rata means you continue to invest additional money in each subsequent round to maintain your original percentage ownership in a company. It’s generally a good idea, but it can get very, very expensive if you hit a major unicorn. [313]
- So, if you have a net worth of $2.5 million and are thinking about becoming an angel investor, you’re basically looking at a likely, worst-case scenario of losing 7 percent, but realistically being somewhere in the range of losing 1 to 3 percent to gaining 20 percent. [334]
- Of course, you could screw up and return zero—you are investing in highly volatile private companies. If you can’t handle losing all your angel investments, I suggest putting this book down now. [338]
- What’s the Downside? Well, you’ve got to find fifty exceptional companies to invest in, and I invest in only one out of every hundred I look at. That means you need to look at five thousand startups over five years to place your bets—that’s twenty startups per week. That’s easily twenty to thirty hours of your life every week. If you want to be in this game, you have to do the work. [340]
- In order to be an effective angel investor, you need some combination of money, time, network, and expertise. [350]
- There is a long-standing, and totally accepted, tradition of “advisors” getting 10 or 50 BPS—basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point—over two or three years, for helping a startup. [359]
- The best angels in the world have four qualities, giving them the ability to (1) write a check (money), (2) jam out with the founders over important issues (time), (3) provide meaningful customer and investor introductions (network), and (4) give actionable advice that saves the founders time and money—or keeps them from making mistakes (expertise). [365]
- If you’re not able to get along with a wide range of people or find it uncomfortable to hear people drone on and on about how they’re going to change the world and everyone else just doesn’t get it, then this is absolutely not the job for you. [370]
- Angel investors are looking for wild cards, because the best founders are typically inflexible and unmanageable, pursuing their visions at the expense of other people’s feelings. [378]
- Do You Need to Be in Silicon Valley to Be a Great Angel Investor? Yes. [381]
- Your goal as an angel investor is to put yourself in a position to hit one of these decacorns (unicorns worth over $10 billion) or decade-acorns (the startups that come along once a decade, on average, and become worth over $100 billion). [409]
- If you choose to be an investor in New York or Los Angeles or Seattle, that’s fine, but you’re going to have to factor in two important things if you want to get a return: You’re going to have massively reduced your expectation of having a big win (i.e., a unicorn, decacorn, or a $100 billion–plus company). You’re going to have to get on a plane and spend ten days here a month anyway. [422]
- There is only one upside to angel investing in a small market like New York or Los Angeles: you are going to be worshipped. There are so few angels in these regions, you’ll be constantly in demand. Also, you’re going to feel great about how efficient you are, because there are so few quality deals to review. [447]
- We live in a world full of network effects. [454]
- The number of folks rooting for and directly helping the startups you invest in will be a thousand times more in the Bay Area than anywhere else. [456]
- Your job as an angel investor is to block out the haters, doubters, and small thinkers, because if you think small you’ll be small. I’d rather see my founders fail at a big goal than succeed at a small one. [493]
- Startup Funding Rounds Explained [497]
- Sweat Equity The first round of funding in many startups comes from the founders themselves, in the form of working on their business for free for months. It’s not an official round of funding. [505]
- We call this sweat equity, and it should be a useful indicator to you as an angel investor because it shows that the founders are able to create value without capital. [508]
- What this signals, in my experience, is that if these founders someday run out of money—and almost all startups do—they will likely revert back to not paying themselves, while still pushing the company forward with their effort, in order to save the business (and your investment). [512]
- My approach is to be judgmental and combative, if you haven’t figured that out. I deploy this style for two reasons: (1) It’s who I am; and (2) it is effective in repelling the weak and developing deep, meaningful relationships with the strong. [523]
- A variation on sweat equity is called bootstrapping. Bootstrapping means you are using whatever resources you can get your hands on to solve your problem and pull yourself upward, including that little strap on the back of your boots. [526]
- Startups that have gotten their funding from nonprofessional angels, for example, their rich uncle or friend who made a killing flipping houses, are considered to have completed their “Friends and Family” round. [539]
- You can figure out what you’re dealing with simply by looking at how efficient and resourceful founders have been who have only raised a friends and family round. [544]
- Often, the greatest people you can invest in are the ones who are already investing in themselves. When I meet a founder who says, “I’m currently funding the company,” I immediately want to know two things: how and why. [552]
- Founders can also join an incubator or accelerator in order to get a modest amount of funding. Most incubators will give founders $25,000 to $150,000 in seed funding for 5 to 10 percent of their startup. [569]
- Most great companies did not come out of incubators (Uber, Facebook, Tesla, Google), but once in a while a great one does. [576]
- Most founders get their seed round by successfully completing two or three of the five early-stage funding strategies above. [583]
- Essentially, your job as an angel is to monitor people coming out of these channels and pick out the best ones. [585]
- Most founders underestimate the amount of time, and consequently money, it will take to reach the milestones they need to raise their next round of funding. When a seed stage startup runs out of money before having reached the targets that would make a VC firm fund a Series A, or before hitting breakeven or profitability, they do what’s called a bridge round. It’s called a bridge round because it’s a bridge between where they are now and where they need to go. [597]
- These days, I look at each bridge round I’m asked to participate in with a simple question: What has changed since I made my original investment? [607]
- There is one serious caveat to all of this: the valuation and terms of the bridge. [616]
- If the seed round was at a $4 million valuation and the company has learned a ton and landed some customers, but the valuation has stayed the same, you should put more money in than you already have. It’s a better deal. The company is more valuable now. [617]
- If the seed round was at $4 million and the company is asking for the bridge to be at $8 million, you should simply ask the founder, “How did you arrive at that valuation?” I like to leave a long pause after that question, so the founder can speak their truth and I can understand if the shares are, in fact, worth twice as much. If they aren’t, I can simply say, “I’m going to pass based on valuation.” [619]
- A down round simply means you’re going to change the value of the company, making the people who invested in the last round mark their investment down. When the market crashes, like it did in 2000, 2001, and 2008, many startups went through down rounds. Another way to deal with a bridge that won’t close is to keep the valuation the same but give the bridge investors a “pot sweetener”—a bonus. There are a couple of financial and legal devices to do this. One is a liquidation preference. Another option is issuing warrants. [624]
- Here in Silicon Valley people like to have “clean terms,” which means they shy away from devices like warrants and liquidation preferences. In fact, these are currently considered predatory by most professionals in the Valley. [631]
- The Series A is the most coveted and important round for a startup because it is typically done by a professional venture capital firm that will join the board and create proper “governance.” [635]
- Once you have a Series A, the chief executive officer (CEO) is going to spend about 20 percent of their time “managing their board.” [641]
- As an angel investor, you will sometimes have an opportunity to invest in a Series A, but not often. Why? Because VCs are greedy and have huge stacks of chips. [643]
- If you’re getting into a Series A alongside a powerful VC, you either have a great relationship with the founders, who are demanding you get an allocation, or you provide massive value and the VC thinks that you owning shares in their company will increase everyone’s share value. [647]
- If one of your startups, that you’ve angel invested in, gets a Series A from a known venture capital firm, you want to plow your chips into the pot and take your “pro rata” as much as you can. [649]
- Typically when you angel invest, you don’t get pro rata rights—unless you demand them, and then you do. [651]
- It’s disrespectful not to give angels pro rata rights. Period. [654]
- After the Series A, you’re probably no longer actively investing in the company, and it’s well on its way to an exit. In fact, if your angel investment is starting to raise a Series B, C, D, or further rounds of financing, it’s probably time for you to consider selling some part of your stake in what’s called a “secondary” stock sale. [656]
- Cap Table Basics [665]
- The cap table, short for capitalization table, is the official list of all the shareholders in a company and it includes how much they paid for their shares and what class of shares they each own. [667]
- The easiest way to get on the cap table is to simply buy shares, but this requires two things: Money Access to the deal [670]
- When you first start investing, you should meet with as many people as possible but invest in as few deals as possible. [677]
- In simple terms, there are five kinds of people on a cap table: founders, employees, advisors, angels, and VCs. [681]
- Each of these five kinds of owners is working toward a common goal: increasing the value of the business—or at least they should be. [695]
- The point being, there are only two numbers that matter: how much you put in and how much you got out. How much your shares were worth at their peak is not remotely as important as when you choose to sell them. [719]
- When you look at the venture capitalist on the cap table in our $5 million startup, you have to understand they are operating on a much different formula because they are investing OPM—other people’s money. [724]
- VCs invest OPM and get a 20 percent “carry,” or, simply put, 20 percent of the gains. [726]
- Startup founders often sell too early, leaving money on the table. VCs often force founders to hold out and swing for the fences, risking blowing up companies and locking in gains. We angel investors are generally along for the ride. The good news is that our industry has figured out this divergence of interest and has come up with an effective way to address it: secondary share transactions. [737]
- This is where secondary sales come in. What a VC firm will do is offer to buy some of the founder’s shares to provide the “idiot insurance” we talked about before. This is a delicate balance, and it usually results in a founder being able to sell 10 to 20 percent of their position, which in this case would be $3.5 million to $7 million, which after taxes would be somewhere in the “take the edge off” money range. [747]
- For angels, secondary shares are a wise way to “dollar cost average” your returns. If you have a chance to sell 25 percent of your position once or twice before the IPO, it would be wise to do so because we’ve all seen companies worth billions go to zero many, many, many times. [755]
- But what if you don’t have money? Is there a way to get on the cap table? As we discussed in chapter 4, there is a group of folks known as advisors who trade some combination of their networks and knowledge—and sometimes freelance work—in exchange for shares in a company. Advising startups is often a great stepping-stone to becoming an angel. [760]
- Additionally, there are two more ways to get on the cap table: you can found/co-found a company or go to work at a company and vest shares over time. Of course, if you do those things you are going to limit yourself to one lottery ticket (or cap table) every four years (the amount of time required for folks to “vest” their shares as a founder or employee at a company). [765]
- As an angel investor, I invest in thirty startups a year—one every other week or so. [774]
- Of course, to be an angel or VC, you need to have those chips, skills, network, or knowledge to put to work. [777]
- Opportunity Costs [799]
- These days I only take a board seat in my portfolio companies if—and this is a major condition—they are surging or under some sort of unfriendly attack that requires me to join the board to protect them and other shareholders. [800]
- Outside of my own investments, the only way I would join a board of a startup is if the founders were friends or I were massively passionate about the company. [802]
- How to allocate your finite time and energy efficiently is something you constantly have to revisit as an investor, founder, parent, and human being. The cost of not revisiting your allocation of time is great, leading to massive regret at having spent too much time on a startup, marriage, friendship, or investment that is destined to disappoint you or destroy your soul. [821]
- Being a board member or advisor is nice work if you can get it, but you have to be willing to put the work in over a decade in the tiny startups that need you before the bigger companies that don’t need you as much will let you join their boards. [869]
- If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have graduated college and gone directly into angel investing. [933]
- How to Hack Angel Investing: Syndicates [970]
- Carry is short for “carried interest,” and it’s defined as the share of profits that go to the fund manager—in this case called the syndicate lead. [984]
- On these platforms, the syndicate leads typically take a 15 percent carry and the platform itself takes another 5 percent, for a total of a 20 percent carry. [988]
- Venture capitalists typically charge what’s called “20 and 2” to their LPs: 20 percent carry and a 2 percent management fee. The management fee is money advanced by the LPs to the partners in the venture fund in order to pay for their overhead (salaries, office space, tickets to expensive conferences like TED and Davos). [990]
- With angel syndicates, you simply pay the carry. There are no fees other than some minor legal and filing fees (typically less than $10,000 per deal, spread out across the dozens of investors in a deal). [995]
- Founders love syndicates because they can leverage an established angel investor to round up dozens of smaller investors for them. [1004]
- Founders also love angel syndicates because they exist as only one entity on their cap table: the SPV. [1005]
- Angel syndicates love the program because it can easily triple their returns, simply by sharing their deal flow. [1008]
- Now, syndicate members love syndicates because they can invest in startups that more established angels have (hopefully) vetted. [1013]
- Plus you don’t have to say yes to every deal. You can always opt out. [1015]
- The only thing you give up by being in a syndicate is 20 percent of the return, which seems like a fair trade of services. [1016]
- The jury is out on exactly what the levels of returns will be, but the fact remains that they are an efficient and low-risk way to get some experience in angel investing. [1017]
- That’s why I advocate that new angels do ten small angel syndicates before they start doing direct investing. Beyond the very real chance of getting a positive return on your investment, if you do this hack, you will build your reputation, have a chance to prove your worth to founders, and jump-start your network—all for the bargain price of $25,000. That’s only 20 percent of the cost of an MBA and you can do it in a month! [1027]
- Syndicates require very little paperwork and you can choose to invest without taking any meetings or doing any due diligence. The only thing you need be able to do is prove that you’re an accredited investor here in the United States and have your wire transfer clear. [1034]
- After you make ten investments for $2,500 each, you’ll be on the cap table of ten startups along with dozens of other investors. After just one month and ten deals, you will have a network of hundreds of co-investors, as well as a network of twenty to thirty founders you have invested in, since most startups have two to four founders these days. [1036]
- You’ll also be able to be as unapologetic and gauche as I was in my early career and put “Angel investor in . . .” in your really long email signature. Once you have the phrase “angel investor” on your online profiles, you will have instant deal flow. [1040]
- There is a chance that the founder of the next big thing might stumble upon your profile while searching LinkedIn or browsing AngelList and—boom!—you might be the person who takes a meeting with them and gives them their first check. Someone has to write these early checks. Why not you? [1047]
- Month One: Your First Ten Syndicate Deals [1051]
- Picking the Syndicate Deals to Join [1052]
- As an angel investor, you are going to need to invest in fifty startups (diversification!) in Silicon Valley (location!) over three years in order to have a chance at an outsize return. That’s one to two startups a month. [1055]
- In the investment community, we have a term for an investment that returns all your capital invested: a “dragon.” So your job is to find dragon eggs. [1060]
- Right now, however, we want to get your résumé filled with ten quality angel investments that include dozens of well-known, successful angels. [1061]
- A startup that has a product or service that is already in the market (you’re not qualified to invest in startups that haven’t released their products—and frankly you don’t need to take this risk) [1066]
- A startup that has either (a) six months of continuous user growth or (b) six months of revenue [1067]
- A startup that, post-funding, will have eighteen months of cash remaining, commonly referred to as runway (ask the founder and syndicate lead how many months of runway they will have post-funding) [1069]
- So what percentage of your net worth—your bankroll—should you put on the table? How much of your net worth should you risk angel investing? It largely depends on three things: [1077]
- How tied up can you afford this portion of your net worth to be [1078]
- How easy is it for you to get more money [1080]
- How would you feel if you lost 100 percent of the money you allocated to angel investing? [1081]
- If you love taking risks and don’t mind being locked up for a decade, I could see you putting 10 to 20 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. If you can tolerate risk, but don’t love it, and you can handle being illiquid for a decade, I could see you putting 5 percent of your bankroll into angel investing. [1083]
- How to Act in a Syndicate [1094]
- In short, you should look at angel investing as a competition where you’re trying to provide more value than any other angel in the company—including me! [1106]
- Write Deal Memos For all ten of the startups you select, you need to write a “deal memo” explaining why you’re investing, what you think the risks are, and what you think has to go right for the startup to return money on your investment. [1111]
- You will review these deal memos every time the startup raises a new round of funding so that you can test if your original thesis still applies. [1114]
- For every startup you didn’t invest in, write clear notes on the reasons why you passed. [1116]
- Even when you are investing in a startup via a syndicate, I recommend you meet in person with the founders at least once—if not twice. Visiting their office, even if it’s a dump, is advisable. [1118]
- Most important, you should only invest in these ten startups if you would buy stock in the founders themselves. [1122]
- Jedi Poker Syndicates are your Dagobah, a place where you can learn from other angel masters without losing a limb or your head. Go ahead and ask the syndicate lead why they are investing, meet with the founders, and talk to their customers—learn how to hold a lightsaber without cutting your fingers off. [1123]
- Angel: It’s Not Just a Job As far as I’m concerned, angel investing is a vocation or a calling. It’s like teaching or being a Jedi. You should take it seriously because your actions can help create massive change in the world. [1146]
- Month Two: Thirty Days of Angel and Founder Meetings [1175]
- Building Your Network [1176]
- Meet Twelve Angels The best deals are typically not on platforms like AngelList or at incubators like Y Combinator or 500 Startups. The best deals never see the light of day. They’re quickly filled by insiders who are sharing deal flow, and by elite founders with killer startups tapping their existing network. [1182]
- Step one, create a spreadsheet of all the co-investors in those ten startups you’ve invested in. [1187]
- In your spreadsheet, put the person’s LinkedIn, AngelList, Twitter, and Facebook URLs. Connect with each of them on each of these four critical services. When you connect with them, send them a message that says, “Hey Jason… [1189]
- in the process you will learn how other investors present… [1192]
- Step two, make a private Twitter list called “co_investors,” and include all these investors in it. Bookmark that list on your browser and open it once or twice a day, favoriting,… [1193]
- The next step is to start emailing the top, most interesting investors in this process. They might be the syndicate leads, or they might be people… [1196]
- Hey Jason, we co-invested in Company X together. Do you have time for a quick cup of coffee next week? I’ll be investing at least $2,500 into 2 startups per month going forward and I’d… [1200]
- When you meet with fellow investors, your goals are: Figure out what they invest in and why. Figure out what value they bring to startups. Make sure they understand what value you bring to startups. Ask them, “Have you seen anything interesting lately?” Offer them, “I just invested in these two startups, which are exceptional. Would you like to get introduced to… [1202]
- When meeting with other investors, always remember that you… [1210]
- I need to know that a meeting with you is worth my founders… [1211]
- After you meet with each of these angels, promptly email them and thank them for their time. Include a list of the ten startups you’ve invested in, with links to each one. Always ask them if… [1214]
- Now you’re starting to provide value to everyone else in the ecosystem, which you will receive back… [1218]
- Finally, you need to email all of your founders and let them know that they don’t need permission to introduce you to other founders who are looking for investors or other investors who are looking to expand their networks.… [1219]
- After you’ve met with a dozen angel investors, it’s time for you to start looking for “proprietary deal flow,” which is to say, deal flow that is yours—not the public stuff on AngelList… [1223]
- Jason, it was great getting coffee with you last week. I noticed that you’re an angel investor in Tesla and I think they have a really interesting vision of a carbon-free future. Was wondering, would you mind introducing me to Elon Musk? I believe strongly in Elon’s vision and I’ve got two specific… [1227]
- People want to meet with people who are fascinated by their vision, so take a moment to state why you think their vision is important and how you think you can help them achieve it—because they… [1232]
- A second email you can send to your new network of angels is the simple and sincere: Have you seen… [1234]
- You’re now an insider’s insider, getting warm introductions to founders who are either raising money or will be in the future, by people… [1239]
- Getting Good at… [1243]
- In month two, you are going to meet with twenty-five founders. You’re going to listen to their pitches and ask lots of short questions and write long notes about their answers. When they ask you if you’re in, you’re going to… [1244]
- Again, never say yes in a meeting. Let them know that you need to do research and think about the deal terms. Then, only after you have seen all… [1246]
- You now have three columns: company name, a Great/Good/Okay rating, why you are not investing, and why you are considering investing in the great ones. [1252]
- For your top four companies—the Great ones—ask for a second meeting and do a little due diligence (see chapter 24). Add a fourth column to your Google spreadsheet where you put your second round of comments on the Great companies, detailing why you said no to three of the Great companies and yes to one. [1255]
- Put a recurring calendar reminder for every six months to visit this spreadsheet and make a fifth column with notes on how the twenty-four companies you passed on are doing—specifically whether they’ve raised more money or shut down. [1258]
- A word of warning: the founders who have gone to Y Combinator and 500 Startups have been trained to set artificial deadlines and manufacture scarcity. [1261]
- This part of your angel journey is the opposite of getting into syndicate deals. In syndicate deals, you just need to get ten logos on your site from vetted startups. In these direct deals, however, you need to be methodical. [1267]
- To be successful, it’s important that you develop good habits and be aware of the bad ones. [1285]
- Founders always share investor meeting details with each other and your reputation is everything in our industry. If you are helpful, present, and considerate, then you’re going to get a great reputation. If you are unprofessional, cavalier, or conceited, or use your position of power in any way that isn’t in service of the founder, then you’re toast. [1286]
- What to Do Before a Pitch Meeting [1344]
- You should allocate three hours for each startup meeting: one hour of prep, one hour with the founders, and one hour of postmortem. [1346]
- If you’re going to meet with a founder, you need to do some research on them. This includes reviewing their product, understanding the market they operate in, knowing who their competitors are, and knowing who else has already invested in the company. [1348]
- Remember, your competition doesn’t take meetings with founders seriously because they think, incorrectly, that they have the power. Your challenge isn’t writing the checks, it’s convincing the right founders to cash them. [1359]
- What to Do During a Pitch Meeting [1363]
- You should dedicate a full hour for your in-person meetings. This signals to a founder that you take them seriously enough to spend time understanding their business. [1365]
- These days, not only do I take a full hour for a meeting, I leave thirty minutes open after it just in case they keep going. [1367]
- The reason I do this is that I want to be known for always having time for founders. [1369]
- Here’s another way to look at your time: if you take a meeting, it makes little difference if it is thirty or forty-five or sixty minutes because you’re doing two hours of research and communication in addition to the meeting. [1374]
- Give Them Your Full Attention [1378]
- Now, when you get into the meeting, you should check your phone one last time, let them know if you have a hard stop, and ask them how they would like to run the meeting. Here’s what I say: “Would you like to run me through your deck, show me your product, or just talk about your business?” [1379]
- I look at those other investors and think, “How can I be more valuable than they are?” [1383]
- Bring Pen and Paper [1390]
- Show up focused, with a notebook and pen so you can take notes like an adult. [1391]
- Activate Silent Mode When the meeting starts, say, “Let me take a moment to turn off my phone.” [1396]
- Coffee Shops Are a Last Resort It is permissible for the meeting to take place at a cafe, but if you’re going to do this professionally, a proper conference room is required. [1400]
- I want folks to feel like meeting with me is like going to a restaurant with multiple Michelin stars. I want folks to understand that we are professionals. [1409]
- The Best Interview Questions Are the Ones You Didn’t Write [1413]
- Over time I’ve learned that your best next question is hidden in the subject’s answer to your last question. I’ve interviewed thousands of people as a journalist, podcaster, and investor, and in that time the best interviews are the ones that morph into conversations. [1414]
- The more you listen to the partner, and really take in what they are saying, the greater conversationalist you will be. [1417]
- Never Say Yes or No During a Pitch There is no reason to say yes or no during a meeting. I’ve done it and I’ve regretted it. If you say yes or no during a pitch meeting, you’re going to seem impulsive and not considered—which is a bad look for an angel, who should be wise and methodical. [1422]
- Of course, if you choose to meet with the founders two or three more times, by all means, feel free to give them the news in person during a follow-up meeting. [1431]
- How to Pick a Billion-Dollar Founder [1434]
- You don’t pick billion-dollar companies. You pick billion-dollar founders. [1437]
- Filtering Your Deal Flow [1439]
- I use two methods to sort through the deluge of startups contacting me. I eliminate the small ideas and weak founders. Then I double down on the great founders and big ideas. [1447]
- When I get an email, I never go straight to the meeting. I ask how many full-time employees they have, how much money they’ve made, their funding history, how they acquire customers, and why they are building this business. The FTE and money-raised answers tell me what their burn rate is and how much they have left in the bank. [1451]
- Angel investing requires a level of ruthlessness and promiscuity with your time because the odds are so challenged. [1457]
- Finding Businesses That Can Scale [1468]
- Independent films, restaurants, bars, bed-and-breakfasts, consulting firms, clothing lines, and microbreweries are—with very rare exceptions—the businesses that, no matter how hard you and the founders work on them, will not scale. [1470]
- If you compare businesses made from atoms (brick-and-mortar shops like Starbucks and McDonald’s) to businesses made from bits (software), there is no comparison. [1483]
- Overcoming Blind Spots Of course, as you get better and better at this, you build up “signaling” that allows you to quickly qualify founders and startups. Of course, you have to be careful that your signaling is not off because, well, the rules and heuristics you build up over the years can create blind spots. [1501]
- Limit Signaling to Founders, Not Ideas or Markets I try to choose companies based on the people running them, not the idea or market, because I’ve learned that no one can tell the future but I am an exceptional judge of talent. [1510]
- People aren’t everything, they are the only thing. [1519]
- The Four Founder Questions [1521]
- Ten one-hour meetings a week is a good target for a professional angel. Half that if you’re doing this part-time. [1534]
- My best advice to you as you start dating is to be promiscuous with meetings—but a prude when it comes to writing checks. Don’t be a tramp like I was. [1535]
- The goal of asking these questions is not just for you to understand the business but also so you yourself can answer four critical investor questions: [1537]
- Why has this founder chosen this business? How committed is this founder? What are this founder’s chances of succeeding in this business—and in life? What does winning look like in terms of revenue and my return? [1539]
- You want to have big ears and a small mouth in these meetings. [1545]
- Listening like this will serve two virtuous goals, the first being that the founder will feel heard and understood by you. If people believe they are being deeply listened to, they will talk more. [1547]
- Second, if you are hyper-present in the meeting, thinking deeply about the founder and why they are taking on the irrational pursuit of starting a company, which comes with a greater than 80 percent chance of failure and a 100 percent chance of suffering, then you will be able to make a better decision on whom to invest in. [1555]
- 0. How do you know Jane? If you were introduced to this founder by a mutual connection, you can quickly establish common ground by asking these five simple words. Listen to the answer you are given and construct a follow-up question based on their answer. [1562]
- I have a game where I try to say things with as few words as possible because it reminds me that this meeting is not about me, it’s about them. [1565]
- These are the exact four questions I ask every founder. The answers to these questions will give you most of what you need to make your investment decision. We spend the first half of our hour-long meeting exclusively on them. Then we go deeper. [1567]
- 1. What are you working on? [1569]
- 2. Why are you doing this? [1574]
- 3. Why now? [1606]
- It’s not who gets there first. It’s who gets there first when the market’s ready. [1634]
- 4. What’s your unfair advantage? [1635]
- The Next Five Questions You Should Ask [1665]
- You should also write down questions you have that, while important, are not worth interrupting the founder [1676]
- I ask founders to explain to me every word I’ve never heard of, be it a company or technology or theory. This helps me in three ways. First, I get points for being considerate. Second, I get to hear how well they can explain things. And third, I get smarter. [1680]
- Even if I lost half the money I’ve invested in startups, I would still do it for the massive education it’s given me! [1684]
- Tactical Questions [1705]
- Here are some quick tactical questions you can get into with the founder so you understand how they plan on executing on their vision. You can prepare them for this part of the meeting by saying, “Can I ask you a couple of quick tactical questions?” [1706]
- They will say yes, and you can rip through a bunch of these, with a qualifier in front (or back) of them like “briefly” or “quickly,” so the founder knows that you just want the short version. [1708]
- Tell me about the competition. How do you make money? How much do you charge customers? How much does your average customer spend? Tell me the top three reasons why this business might fail. [1709]
- In meetings with founders, I’m often able to tell them exactly how much money they are burning and when they will be out of cash. It’s fairly easy to do: you simply write down what their revenue is and how many full-time employees they have. [1731]
- I’ve also asked at some point during the conversation how much they’ve raised. [1739]
- It’s all very simple. I pay attention, write down numbers, and do back-of-the-envelope math all the time. [1748]
- I’ve seen founders working full-time on a startup not do this easy calculation themselves, the same one I do during our meetings, and unexpectedly they run out of money. [1749]
- Personal Questions [1751]
- There are personal questions you can ask founders to get a sense of what they’re about. The one I care about most is, “What did your parents do?” [1752]
- The reason I like to ask this question is because it bonds me with the founder. What a founder’s parents think of their path is critical, almost as critical as what the founders themselves think of their chosen path. [1758]
- No one remembers how you won or lost, only whether you won or lost. The results are all that people will judge you on. [1790]
- However, as an investor, you have to be careful that you don’t invest in thirty schmucks who are not capable of dealing with the never-ending shitshow that is the life of a founder. [1806]
- At the core of being a great founder is the unrelenting desire to see your vision—or version—of the world realized. [1810]
- The number one reason a startup fails is that the founder gives up. [1816]
- If a founder starts a discussion about their compensation at a startup with “I would like to make what Google just offered me,” you can be sure that this founder will quit when they get a better offer. [1820]
- Another huge red flag is founders who won’t start working until they are funded. [1823]
- Or founders who won’t do certain jobs, like making a sales call. Or ones who want to have balance in their lives. [1824]
- One huge red flag is when the founders of a company sell off a great deal of shares early, transferring all of the risk and responsibility to their investors. [1834]
- If a founder doesn’t communicate with their investors, it’s almost universally a sign that they are going out of business (see chapter 27 on monthly updates), but a small percentage of founders are introverts who have their noses to the grindstone. [1844]
- These founders, who are not concise in their communications, are probably not going to do well in the long term. [1855]
- Timing [1862]
- You can put angel investing into two basic buckets: pre-traction and post-traction. Traction comes in the form of people using and sometimes paying for a product. Pre-traction means the product doesn’t have users or revenue. [1864]
- In the early stages, the chances are greater that you will lose your money, but the valuations are lower to reward you for taking the risk. [1868]
- A first-time founder with an idea written on the back of a napkin is, generally speaking, not deserving of your funding. [1869]
- When evaluating deals in Silicon Valley, there is no reason for you, a new angel investor, to invest in pre-traction startups. You can, but you will be taking unnecessary risk. Furthermore because of your limited time, I recommend that you not meet with anyone who doesn’t have a product in the market. [1876]
- In my experience, getting in too early is the cardinal mistake of new angel investors. [1885]
- Simply put, there are enough companies that have product/market fit, some traction, and some angel investors but need more capital to finish their mission. [1892]
- In this situation, where a company you invested in is suddenly worth a lot more, you should look at who is investing that money. [1904]
- Pro rata is the right to maintain your percentage, and it’s important because sometimes a new investor will want to invest and take the entire round for themselves. [1907]
- Pro rata rights are a must and you should never do a deal without them. [1910]
- I’m not asking for free equity, just the ability to write you even larger checks as you grow!” [1914]
- Valuation [1916]
- Sometimes they will have been offered that valuation by a “lead investor,” an investor who puts in the largest amount in this round—say, $250,000—and who is driving the deal. In this case, the round is probably going to close because this investor and founder see eye to eye and want to work together. [1927]
- If the founder picked a large number, say $10 million, and they don’t have a lead, you can certainly say to the founder, “So, ten million is your target. How did you get to that number?” [1931]
- Another great technique is to simply ask the founder, “Is that valuation set in stone?” and just listen. Perhaps they, like countless startups in the past, will come back to you in a couple of weeks, after their round didn’t materialize, and have a different number in mind. [1936]
- This is a marketplace and valuations can go up and down, but valuations are not as important as understanding who the other investors are, how the business is doing, who the customers are, and who’s on the team. [1938]
- With dozens of relationships to manage in a venture capital firm, and decades of failed and successful investments made that you have to parse through, there is a simple device by which decisions are codified: the deal memo. [1960]
- Angels don’t write deal memos, but they should, because deal memos force you to crystalize your thinking in the short term. [1962]
- In his deal memo, Botha included the following sections: Introduction, Deal, Competition, Hiring Plan, Key Risks, and a Recommendation. [1969]
- The truth about 95 percent of incubators is that they are for the founders of startups that couldn’t raise money on their own. Y Combinator and my LAUNCH Incubator would be notable exceptions, as they accept folks farther along the path. [2096]
- New angels should meet founders at incubators but invest in them six or twelve months after they’ve graduated. [2097]
- These days, I am most likely to tell founders “not yet” when they ask me if I’m ready to invest. [2100]
- Third, I set the tone that monthly updates are something I like to see before I give the founder my money. [2111]
- Due Diligence Checklist [2115]
- At an early-stage company, there is not much to do diligence on except for getting a better take on the founders’ backgrounds and reputations. [2119]
- A savvy angel investor understands that you have to drill down into the numbers because people will, intentionally or unintentionally, come up with their own definitions of reality. I call these alternate metrics. [2173]
- It’s nothing to be offended by or concerned about unless you get the sense that the person isn’t displaying a normal level of founder delusion and has leveled up to outright lying. [2183]
- If you write down all the facts you have and then have your assistant or an associate confirm them with backup documents, you’ll be surprised at what you find. [2201]
- All relationships that start with lies will end in tears. Avoid the liars. Embrace the delusional. [2248]
- I came to a simple conclusion, independent of further investigation, which I live by to this day: the appearance of impropriety is impropriety. [2265]
- You’re going to want to have a solid startup attorney review these documents for you, giving you a brief summary of the deal and calling out anything they feel is unusual. [2276]
- You should double-check that you have pro rata [2279]
- As you consummate the deal, you should let them know how excited you are and that you’re most excited to get their monthly updates so that you can help. [2280]
- Put a quick check-in/coffee meeting with the founders a hundred days from now on your calendar, as well as a one-year follow-up call. These are simple things to put on the calendar and my trick is to allocate just twenty minutes so founders don’t feel it’s overbearing. [2282]
- There is always a small chance that an early round can fill up or that one greedy investor will try to take the whole round. If this happens, you can always take a shot by asking the founder, “Is there any way you can fit me in by expanding the round or carving someone else back? I want to work with you and help make this company a huge win for everyone involved.” [2284]
- You should try to get a copy of the cap table if they’re willing to give it, as this gives you a very clear picture of who was involved in the round and how many shares each person owns. [2289]
- Over time, you’ll become good at reading these cap tables and decoding the investing strategies of other angel investors and venture capitalists. [2291]
- You can write a blog post about the company and why you invested. Or you can keep the deal under wraps. Either way, make sure that you are never speaking for the company itself. If you write a blog post, it’s best to share it with the founder and say, “You cool with this?” [2292]
- How Founders Should Treat Their Angels [2300]
- Early-stage investors and founders are on the same team and actually have the same goal: to win. The disconnect that sometimes occurs between founders and investors, players and coaches, soldiers and generals, padawan and Jedi Masters, and students and teachers mostly comes down to communication, execution, and prioritization. [2308]
- Remember, on average we get paid out seven years after we invest in a company—if we get paid at all. [2317]
- You’ll note that I bounce around here with student/teacher and peer/equal metaphors because the relationship of an angel can be both. [2336]
- How to Communicate with Angels Send us monthly updates. Or twice a month. Fuck it, send a short weekly update if it’s concise—we want to help and we can’t help you if we aren’t up to speed. [2342]
- Life is short. Loyalty is all about intent. So if you’re not loyal to your angels, you’re an unworthy idiot or brilliant narcissist. Either way, go fuck yourself. [2355]
- First, as an angel, you need to document and fight for your rights. Be candid with people about why they should respect your rights and make clear the ramifications of them not respecting you. [2399]
- Second, as the founder of a company, you should be on high alert when a new investor or an acquirer wants you to screw your earlier investors. [2402]
- Third, as a co-investor or later-stage investor, it’s important to keep up the esprit des corps at all times. Building startups is brutally hard and infighting between investors is an unacceptable waste of precious time and attention that we should be giving to our founders. [2405]
- Jason’s Rule of Startups: “If a startup isn’t sending you monthly investor updates, it’s going out of business.” [2414]
- The death spiral of founder and angel communication happens when a founder doesn’t disclose any of their problems until they are out of money. [2424]
- The more concise and professional the updates, the greater the chances that angels will be able to help you, including investing more money and introducing you to their friends as a responsible founder who’s a delight to work with. [2435]
- “I would like a monthly update from you that includes the key metrics for the business, as well as what you consider the wins and losses since the last email. I would like you to put requests for me and your other investors in the email as well. Every email should have how much cash you have left, your burn rate, and when you will be out of cash so that we can all plan for future raises.” [2440]
- I keep a Google sheet with each startup in column A and the most recent month in column B, the previous month in Column C, and so on. When a founder sends a monthly update we put the number one in the corresponding cell, and when they don’t we put a zero. We make the zero cells red and the one cells green, then add up the number of updates we get each month from all startups, and from startups over time. [2489]
- If we don’t get an update for two months, we email them and ask, “Did we miss your monthly update?” [2493]
- When you do get a new report, it’s wise to read it fully and send a short follow-up with some positivity for what’s working (“nice work landing that head of sales”) while being understanding about the losses (“Sorry you lost your CTO. Is there a job description I can share on LinkedIn?”). [2498]
- Depending on your related experience, there are always ways for you to be helpful. I like to pose these as questions, as opposed to edicts. [2501]
- A funny thing starts to happen in year two, around your fifth or sixth quarter of investing. The dozen companies you invested in during your first quarter of investing start needing to raise funds again. [2516]
- Remember, when startups raise money, they are targeting twelve to eighteen months of runway, which is the amount of money they raised divided by the amount they burn in the average month. [2518]
- While most startups try to raise eighteen months of runway, they often raise under a year, so many of your early investments will be coyly asking you to have coffee nine to fifteen months after you invest in them. [2523]
- The fundraising process for early-stage startups tends to be two to four months, [2525]
- When founders from strong companies raise another round, they will simply let you know that they’ve found a new investor, hopefully a venture capitalist who also wants to join the board, and tell you what the new terms are and ask if you want to take your pro rata. [2533]
- This doesn’t happen too often, and when it does, you should spend as much time as possible figuring out what this new investor sees in your startup. [2536]
- If new money is willing to pay a higher price, it probably means you picked a winner and you might want to consider putting in another $100,000. [2537]
- Years three and four are when founders confirm for you that you made the right decision when you invested in them, but years one and two are filled with only the confirmation that you are clueless. [2544]
- If the startup is selling a product or is a marketplace, you have a very simple metric you can study to decide if you should invest again: revenue. [2551]
- When deciding to give a bridge, you need to have a candid talk with the founders about what the bridge will accomplish, typically by having them present some goals and what the startup will look like when this new tranche of capital comes in. [2556]
- I think you get the point. The bridge round is more often than not a “bridge to nowhere round.” [2575]
- Year two sucks, but the later years of angel investing—specifically years three to seven—tend to be filled with good and sometimes great news. [2593]
- You’ve chosen this life and, by reading this book, you know the odds well. They’re stacked in favor of people who take a long view and who quadruple down on their winners. They’re stacked in favor of the people who are self-aware enough to realize that the losses come early and the big wins come late in the process. [2615]
- Things seem really horrible when they blow up (see the discussion about Sparrow in chapter 30) or people screw you (see chapter 9), but if you remain aware that you’re going to go through some normal phases of grief or frustration, you can accelerate those phases. [2624]
- I like to get the founder’s worldview after they explain the problem and I confirm it by asking, “What are you planning to do?” And following up with, “How can I help?” [2636]
- As an angel investor, your number one job, in my mind, is to be there for the CEO when they’re struggling, making sure they feel heard and that they know you are on their side. [2645]
- If you’re relentlessly positive and candid with the founders and yourself, you’re going to have a greater chance of success and you’re going to be able to remain positive, even in the face of failure. In fact, over and over again I bring all of my failed founders back to my incubator to tell their stories of failure and what they learned. [2648]
- It’s best to spend your effort on the things that you have complete control over, like your knowledge and work ethic. [2653]
- Don’t Speak For Your Portfolio Companies [2657]
- The best you can do in these cases is privately support the heck out of the founders and their management teams and help them resolve their challenges. Never engage the press—unless the founders themselves ask you to. [2674]
- If you are managing your bankroll properly, you’re going to have a much easier time enjoying angel investing. As we’ve outlined in this book, I believe that angel investing 5 or 10 percent of your net worth is a worthwhile pursuit, perhaps even 20 percent if you’re a younger person with a steady income stream. The key is to deploy it intelligently. [2681]
- You don’t need to win every pot. You don’t need to win every day. You do need to win in the long term. Think about angel investing as a decadelong pursuit. [2698]
- Starting companies is really easy, but finishing them—by having an exit—is really hard. [2701]
- You don’t have to obsess over the losers, but I would certainly meditate on them and look for patterns. [2721]
- How You Get Paid [2729]
- The best, but least common, way for you to sell your shares is almost always if your startup gets so big that it has an initial public offering. [2732]
- These shares are typically locked up for the first six months you own them, but after that “lockup period” you can do what you want with them without the permission of the company, other investors, or the founder. [2734]
- If you were a Facebook or Twitter holder with 90-plus percent in those two companies, there was an obviously sound investment thesis you should have followed: diversification. [2744]
- An amazing thing happened given the massive growth of Twitter and Facebook in the 2007–10 era: a market for selling private company shares emerged. [2758]
- If you have a winner and it’s surging, it’s tough to sell knowing that your equity is likely to grow. But taking 10 or 20 or 30 percent of your winnings off your table at a high-enough price and putting it back into your portfolio will almost always help you sleep better. [2770]
- The third, and most common way, an angel makes their money is when a startup is bought. This is a double-edged sword because most of the time a company sells it’s because it can’t make it on its own. [2780]
- There are three types of M&A (merger and acquisition) deals: acquihires (a.k.a. fire sales), appropriate acquisitions, and premium sales. [2786]
- Operators wanting to buy your startup is the second-most-positive sign in all of entrepreneurship. The only sign that’s better is paying customers raving to their friends about how awesome your product is. [2851]
- Remember, we have more blind spots than we do clear vision, so you must unlearn what you have learned to be a successful angel. [2878]
- So, the only motivation a reasonable investor would have to sue a startup they invested in is if they felt they were intentionally duped. [2908]
- The bottom line is that many of the great companies in the world were built on the promise of removing pain from people’s lives. Sometimes folks have a huge problem and they are searching for a solution. [2960]
- When you look at a startup that is creating the eighty-ninth photo sharing app, you have to ask yourself, Is this really solving any major pain points? [2983]
- Make an x axis and y axis and name them “intensity of pain” and “frequency of people experiencing that pain.” [3037]
- As I mentioned, some startups are so delightful to use that people can’t live without them and will pay a premium for them. These startups have pricing power, and pricing power is a magical thing in the world of business because it’s rare and because it results in obscene returns. [3052]
- Delight startups are the opposite of problem startups. It’s common to hear investors ask, “Is your startup a vitamin or a painkiller?” [3054]
- There is a simple tool for figuring out how delightful a startup’s product is. It’s called NPS and it stands for Net Promoter Score. [3061]
- There are some investors who feel it’s the market that makes the startup. [3065]
- This is why the market strategy is not as effective as the founder and problem theories of startups, in my mind. [3076]
- The good news is you don’t need to pick one theory and live by it. You can be holistic and run a startup through all of these theories and see where they wind up. Then convince yourself to ignore the ones you don’t like and use your gut! [3077]
- Angel investing, as we’ve learned, is a unique vocation, because if you’re qualified to be an angel, you are overqualified to be a venture capitalist, and venture capitalists have a much easier and more financially rewarding life. [3087]
- But back to you. Here are all the common scenarios of what will happen if you invest in thirty startups in the manner I’ve described in this book, with the first ten being $1,000 syndicates and the next twenty being $25,000 bets, and then putting an extra $100,000 into each of the top five startups in your portfolio. In this scenario, you will have put $510,000 into your first thirty deals, watched for winners, and put another $500,000 into the winners. You’ll have put just over $1 million to work. [3104]
- You Return Less Than You Invested [3108]
- You’ll be able to study your investment thesis and either use the exact same exit strategy in your next thirty startups or upgrade your strategy and do even better. [3113]
- If you’re exhausted from angel investing but you are addicted to startups, you’ll have a nice track record with founders that will allow you to join a venture capital firm with a $500,000 starting salary, making this a fantastic investment similar to getting your undergrad and graduate degrees! [3115]
- You Return What You Invested [3118]
- You now have the option to keep being an angel, join a firm, or perhaps even take a management team or board seat at your highest-performing investment, getting you 1 to 2 percent of the company and a nice salary as you help build the company to a billion. [3121]
- You Return Two to Five Times What You Invested [3127]
- If this happens, you will not only have the ability to join one of your startups, get on boards, or join a venture capital firm, but you will also have a track record to raise your own fund by sharing your return data with all the other rich people you’ve met, giving you a large multiplier on your future investing. Raising your own fund is another book, and since I’ve only raised one small $10 million fund, I’m not the person to write that book—yet. [3132]
- You Return More Than Five to One Hundred Times What You Invested [3135]
- In fact, almost all angels probably have a very similar return profile if you take out their top investment—and the exact same return profile if you take out their top three hits. [3143]
- If you hit a home run like this, you are a legend in our industry and can work for a top-tier firm or even start your own incubator like I did, with investors and founders flocking to it, assuming that you have the Midas touch—even if we both know no one actually does. [3145]
- Lucky people surround themselves with the most successful people in the world and take chances. It isn’t hard or impossible. It just takes work. [3148]
