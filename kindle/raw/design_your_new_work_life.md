# Designing Your New Work Life: How to Thrive and Change and Find Happiness--and a New Freedom--at Work by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans

- Yet most jobs are built around tasks to get done and transactions to manage, and most managers aren’t comfortable talking about meaning and impact. (153)
- When designing your work life, you need to know that designers don’t think their way forward. Work designers build their way forward. To do that, you need to understand and begin to cultivate the mind-set of a designer. (228)
- The design mind-setse: curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, radical collaboration, and—the bonus—storytelling. (231)

# 1 Are We There Yet? - Dysfunctional Belief: Good enough isn’t good enough, I want more. Reframe: Good enough is GREAT—for now. (307)
- Wherever you are in your work life, whatever job you are doing, it’s good enough. For now. Not forever. For now. (325)
- Psychologists have a term for the endless seeking of more—the hedonic treadmill (hedonic = pleasure-seeking). For our purposes, the hedonic treadmill describes a process of being addicted to new experiences and the acquisition of new things. (337)
- There is plenty of evidence that much of the unhappiness in the world comes from not realizing that we have enough, in many cases more than we need. (352)
- Another secret to a happy life is found in Harvard’s Grant Study, (370)
- What makes life meaningful and what maximizes your happiness and longevity are relationships—who you love and who loves you. (373)
- And there is a strong correlation between doing something for the benefit of others and living a longer, healthier life. (374)
- Good enough for now leaves open the possibility of growth and change but doesn’t make changing for change’s sake a goal. And it doesn’t make getting “more” a priority. (380)
- We are suggesting that, to change your point of view and to start moving toward more happiness, it is best to stop waiting for something or someone else to change. (435)

## Reframe Not Rename (441)
- When you reframe, you are actually completely reorganizing how you structure your perception of a situation (which of course means a new point of view), which fundamentally alters how you focus your attention and deploy your bias to action. (449)
- If you are in an abusive job, or being discriminated against, or being asked to do things that are immoral, illegal, or both—run, don’t walk, for the exit. Life is too short to put up with that. (462)
- Remember, for now implies hope, hope that there might be a better outcome in the future, and it gives us a space to prototype into. (466)
- And sometimes the best prototype is to just wait a little bit. (470)
### Dysfunctional Belief: To have a good work life I need to “go for it” and really shoot for the moon! Reframe: The secret to “good enough for now” is to have a bias to action, but set the bar low, clear it, then do it again, and again. (475)

##  Set the Bar Low (478)
- Behavior change is tough, and people try too hard, go for too much, and fail, almost every single time. (489)

##  Set Small Goals (493)
- The Set the Bar Low method is based on some pretty sound psychological studies and behavior change models that suggest that taking small, actionable steps is the best way to establish a new behavior or habit. (493)
- Celebrating is critical, as it gives your brain a little dopamine blast as a reward for successfully making a change. (504)
- Every two weeks, once you’ve met your previous goal, you make a small, incremental change. If you fall behind, no problem, just reset your goals and start over—but no ice cream. Your brain needs to pay a penalty for messing up. (506)
- Signing up for a race also introduces another powerful motivator—accountability. It is best to sign up for these races with a friend and make an agreement to show up and finish the race, together. Studies show that when we create accountability, in this case by committing to a race and agreeing to run and finish the race together, the likelihood of our meeting our commitment increases substantially. (509)
- Start small, set the bar low, and try something. (515)

## Notice What’s Working @ Work (516)
- In Designing Your Life, we had readers try a basic self-awareness exercise called the “Good Time Journal.” (517)
- The basic principle is the same as the Good Time Journal: You observe and record your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors while at work, and then record what you notice about your work and your job. (521)
- We have a few different categories of “noticing” that are connected to the research about what makes work “good work,” and they are: (522)
- What did I learn? What did I initiate? Who did I help? (523)
- Then you see if anything pops out at you by asking the question What do I notice? (525)
- Also be on the lookout for what we call an “unlearning.” That’s when, instead of adding to the things you know, you learned that something you thought was true wasn’t. (563)
- To feel like your work is working for you, the science says you have to be learning something every day. So notice every day what you learn. (567)
- When you take it upon yourself to initiate an action, a change, or a new way of doing something, you satisfy what psychologists call an “innate need,” and these needs are uniquely human. (570)
- Set the goal to initiate something new at work at least once a week. You’ll be surprised how good this makes you feel. (575)
- And just like our intrinsic need for initiation, humans have an intrinsic motivation toward what psychologists call “relatedness.” We call it being helpful. (580)
- So take notice, every day or at least once a week, of something that you have done in the service of the people you work with. (581)
- When you start noticing that you are learning new things, initiating useful changes around the office, and helping others enjoy their work, you’ll probably notice that your satisfaction with work is increasing. (586)

## A Time for Reflection (592)
- We recommend that you take five to ten minutes—that’s all—once a week on a non-workday, a Saturday or Sunday for most of us, and use that time for what we call our “7th Day Reflection” exercise. (601)
- To reflect is to think, ponder, or meditate on an idea or experience, and when we use the term, we mean to give some quiet, focused attention to select ideas or experiences. (604)

- There are two types of life design reflections: (606)
- 1.Savoring 2.Insight (607)

- By savoring we simply mean returning to an experience or thought and reentering and re-remembering it. (609)
- Savoring will deepen the experience, secure it in your memory, and expand your understanding of why the experience was valuable. Voilà! With a few moments of investment, you got more out of life—for free! Of course, if you document your savoring reflection with a note in your journal, your chance of experiencing more meaning in your life goes way up. (615)
- The second possible outcome—an insight reflection—is a more elusive beast, and it may or may not happen. (618)
- But we can increase our chances, and invite and enable insights, by reflecting on and savoring our experiences. (620)
- Insight reflection usually begins with a question. Insights can be thought of as an ongoing conversation with yourself and your inner world. The insight generally comes by seeing the “bigger picture” behind an experience, or by sensing a deeper structure or emotional framework that gives the experience more importance. (621)
- Don’t forget that reflection is a practice. That means that to be most effective, it ought to happen regularly. (633)

## Wait, Are We There Yet? (637)

## 7th Day Reflection Exercise (716)
- Retreat (718)
  - Find a quiet spot where you can sit comfortably for five to ten minutes, either at a table or with a surface you can write on (preferably by hand, but typing is okay if you prefer). (719)
  - Close your eyes and just breathe for a moment. Take at least three or four full, calming breaths to slow yourself down and be glad that you’re alive and have this quiet moment to yourself. (721)
- Review (724)
  - Now, while still keeping your eyes closed, let the last seven days flow before your mind’s eye. As you do so, look for two to four moments in your week that you are attracted to and grateful for in retrospect. (725)
  - Note: Beware of being “attracted” to problems, conflicts, forgotten to-do items, etc. The mind loves to get caught up in that stuff. When that stuff appears (and it will), just tell yourself, I’ll get to that another time, and let it go. Don’t fight it or attempt to resolve it—both of which will steal all your attention. (727)
  - As you review your week, being attentive to those two to four moments, very briefly jot down just one or two words for each such moment that stands out, so you won’t lose it. “Cheerful grocer” or “finished essay” or “appeased boss.” (731)
- Reflect (734)
  - Fully savor each of those moments again—getting the most out of them. (736)
  - If one particularly pulls your attention, feel free to journal a bit further about the experience. Nothing long or dramatic—just an entry to capture that experience. (737)
- Reinforce & Retain (740)
  - Then reinforce your reflection by saying to yourself something like I’m really glad for these things. With these in mind, it was a good week. This is putting “good enough for now” to work proactively. (741)
  - If you notice that any of the moments you identified are offering an insight or a learning you want to capture, write that down, too. (746)
  - One way of getting the most out of your life is by giving it away—through storytelling. (750)
  - What this exercise does is help you decide how to optimize your own experience of your life in your favor. (756)

# 2 Money or Meaning - Dysfunctional Belief: I must choose money or meaning because I can’t have both! Reframe: Money versus meaning (like work-life balance) is a false dichotomy. Money and meaning are just two different measurements of what I value. (762)

## The Coherent Life (783)
- The coherent life is one lived in such a way that you can clearly connect the dots between who you are, what you believe, and what you are doing. (784)
- In Designing Your Life we explained the two things you need to build your compass—a Workview and a Lifeview. (785)
- A Workview is a manifesto—it’s the set of values you use to define what you think good work is and is not. It is an articulated philosophy of what work means to you. (787)
- A Lifeview sounds big and daunting, but it is simply your own particular ideas about what gives life meaning and what makes life worthwhile. (796)
- One good reason to have a clearly articulated Workview and a Lifeview, other than trying to live a coherent life, is so you don’t end up accidentally living someone else’s Workview or Lifeview. (806)
- Living the coherent life doesn’t mean everything lines up perfectly every perfect day of your perfect life. It just means that you are doing your best to live in alignment with your World- and Lifeviews, whatever those may be. (815)

## Workview Reflection (819)
- This should take about thirty minutes, and try to shoot for 250 words—less than a page of writing. (820)

## Lifeview Reflection (822)
- This should also take no more than thirty minutes, and should be 250 words or so. (823)
- The only way to do these reflections incorrectly is not to do them at all. (824)
- Seriously, do this exercise right now. After you’ve written both, see where your Workview and Lifeview complement each other. Notice where you are living a coherent life, and where you are not. (828)

## Creating Coherence (871)
- One warning: In the modern workplace people aspire to having their income-producing work also be their meaning-producing work. (882)
- This is the unicorn. (885)
- Most people, even if they find their passion, can’t make a living at it. (887)
- For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, people aspired to a simpler idea, where you make money one place and have a life in another. (890)

## So, What Do You Make? (898)
- Here’s our reframe—making is great. (901)
- Now, what you make is the question, and it’s not just about how much. (902)
- In the marketplace we generally use money as the measure of what we make. (907)
- In the nonprofit world, which we will call the “making a difference economy” from now on, what people make is impact. (909)
- Regardless of whether they work for a nonprofit or a for-profit organization, most people care about both their success in making money and their success in making an impact. Finding and maintaining the right combination supports them in living a meaningful life. (911)
- However, that’s not the whole story. We also find that, when people do their Workview and Lifeview and create their compass, living more creatively almost always pops up in one way or another. (914)
- In the artistic or “creative economy,” it is all about the value of putting your ideas, your creative output, out into the world for all to see. (920)
- Finding your “mix” of all three maker-metrics will increase your sense of success and happiness, so coming up with a good mix for you, for now, of money, impact, and expression is important. (922)
- In consulting, you are always working on someone else’s idea, so you can’t try to control for impact and expression. (941)
- Again, the objective is coherence, and a good fit, with your goals and your stage in life. (954)
- When you accept and understand the game you’re playing, whether it be for money, impact, or expression (and it’s always some combination of all three, regardless of what job you’re in), you get clear that you value the rewards of the game, according to the rules of the game. (967)

### Dysfunctional Belief: I can’t make a living as an artist, dancer, singer, painter…fill in the blank. Reframe: I know the money-versus-meaning problem is a false dichotomy, and I’m not letting the market define who I am and what I create. I decide how much money, impact, and self-expression works for me. (993)

## Mapping Your Impact (997)
- Do I really fit here? Am I really in the right job/career/company? Is this really the right contribution and impact I want to make? (998)
- So we’ve designed a tool to help you suss out the type and scope of the impact you are having—and we called it the Impact Map. (1006)
- On our map, there are basically three different types of impact you can have in the world. One is not better or worse than another, but they are qualitatively different. Renewing and Repairing things Sustaining and Supporting things Creating New-New things (1009)
- On the vertical axis we map our point of impact—the places where we touch the world—which could be near to us (personal) or far from us (global). (1017)
- The good news is that designers love problems. And the first thing that designers do when faced with a persistent, recurring, or hard-to-solve problem is to design a better problem. We call it “reframing.” Designers do it all the time, and so can you. (1062)
- We recommend revisiting your compass every year or so, or whenever you are contemplating a big change, like changing jobs or careers, or moving to a new city or town, or whenever you start a new chapter in your life. That’s when having an accurate compass is the most helpful. (1068)

## Maker Mix Exercise (1073)
- Write a few sentences about how it’s going in each of the three areas: moneymaking, impact-making, and expression-making. (1081)
- Ask yourself how you feel about your board. (1085)
- Now build the board you aspire to, the one that you think would represent one manageable step toward a better balance, one that would result in a more coherent life. (1086)
- Brainstorm a couple of simple changes you’d like to make to adjust any one of your “slices.” (1089)

## Map Your Role Exercise (1115)
- List 4–6 roles (past, present, and possible future). (1116)
- Locate the roles on the map. (1120)
- What do I notice? Are there any patterns to this data? What insights does this generate? What questions surfaced during this exercise? What am I now more curious about? (1146)

# 3 What’s the Problem? - Dysfunctional Belief: My problems at work are insurmountable. I’m totally stuck. Reframe: I’m never totally stuck, because I know how to reframe anything into a Minimum Actionable Problem (MAP). (1162)
- Figuring out which work problem is actually the problem to work on may be one of the most important decisions you make in designing your work life. (1169)

## The Art of Reframing (1171)
- There are lots of skills that contribute to effective problem-finding, which we define as identifying the most effective problem to work on—the one that gives you the best chance of coming up with lots of good solutions. Learning the art of reframing to find a better problem is by far the most crucial of your life design skills. (1172)
- Step 1: Accept that there is always a box. Step 2: Remind yourself that you made the box when you framed the question, and you can change the frame when you need new, more helpful solutions. (1189)
- Minimum Actionable Problem (MAP) (1192)
- We find that so-called insurmountable problems like Bernie’s are usually either (1) truly inactionable and therefore circumstances to accept and not actionable problems (we call these “gravity problems,” because, well, there’s nothing you can do about gravity, it just is), or (2) poorly framed problems that we can reframe to make them more actionable. (1207)

## Zooming In (1213)
- Doing a thorough and penetrating situation analysis at the beginning of any project is crucial. (1214)
- In most situations, there’s what psychologists like to describe as the presenting situation and then there’s the underlying situation. (1223)
- The first key to learning how to reframe something is to break open the difference between what’s going on and what’s really going on. The trick to doing that is first zooming in to get rid of stuff in the first description that doesn’t need to be there. Then, to get rid of any other baggage you might be carrying, you zoom out to decipher what’s really going on, behind the scenes. (1226)
- Step 1: Ask Question #1: “What’s going on?” (1230)
- Step 2: Zoom in to strip out the unnecessary drama. (1232)
- Start with the question: What personal biases, presumptive reactions, or embedded solutions have found their way into Bernie’s description of this problem, biases that are weighing it down unnecessarily? (1233)
- Step 3: Ask Question #2: What’s really going on? (1264)
- This is the critical step where you take the insights from Step 2 and reframe how you describe the problem in a way that defines your new MAP—Minimum Actionable Problem. (1265)
- don’t get hung up on getting it right. Just get it actionable. (1267)
- At the d.school we like to start a reframe with the phrase How might we… for teams or How might I… for individuals. (1268)
- Bonus Round: Zooming Out—What’s Really, Really Going On? (1297)
- But take a look inside and see what you notice. Very often the dramatic stuff in a stuck situation includes our own old baggage: old wounds not yet fully healed, sensitivities we just can’t seem to dampen, biases no one’s talked us out of yet—those sorts of things. (1310)

## The Big Reframe Zoom-Out Double Bonus (1326)
- Every now and then when you do a Zoom Out reflection on your reframe process you score the Big Reframe Double Bonus. You discover that, like Bernie, there is a chance for you to get just what you want, if you just ask for what you need. (1349)

## Life Is a Multiple-Choice Test (1355)
- Now that you’ve got a reframe working and you’ve redefined the problem—what do you do with your brand-new, small-enough-to-be-actionable MAP? Well, what you don’t try to do is solve it. (1356)
- Most of the time the best we can do with our problems is solve them “for now.” So it might be more accurate to say that, rather than solving a problem, we’re actually just responding to a problem and trying to get it into an acceptable new state. (1362)
- The problem might not be permanently solved, but it is resolved for now, it is re-solved. (1365)

## Best Doable Option (BDO) (1378)
- It frequently turns out that many of the really hard problems in life are best treated as multiple-choice tests. You don’t really have to figure it all out—all you have to know is enough to choose.” (1386)
- That and the designer’s mind-set of bias to action and you are good to go. We call it “finding the Best Doable Option (BDO).” (1388)
- It turns out that lots of problems, even after being well reframed, are difficult if not impossible to fully understand. But in most cases you have only a finite number of viable alternatives, so you don’t need to “understand” your problem, in all its existential glory, you just need to know enough to pick from among the doable options. (1411)

## BDO, not BTO (1414)
- The trick here is to remind yourself that you’re going for the Best Doable Option (BDO), which is not the same as the Best Theoretical Option (BTO). (1415)
- And don’t let worrying about the nonexistent Best Theoretical Option steal your enjoyment of your chosen BDO. (1424)
- Bill took an economics class when he was a freshman, and he was introduced to a concept that economists call “satisficing.” It’s a funny word, a combination of satisfy and suffice. Wikipedia defines it this way: “Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic [a formula for making a decision] that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met.” (1426)

## The Terrible Twins (1435)

### Anchor Problems: (1437)
- An anchor problem occurs because we actually define the problem as one of our preferred solutions; we embed a solution in the problem. In other words, an anchor problem isn’t really a problem at all—it’s an unnegotiable and, unfortunately for you, unavailable solution masquerading as the problem. (1444)
- The way to cut the anchor loose and get free again is to reframe the problem and brainstorm alternatives. (1446)
- What we’ve learned over the years of working with people is that anchor problems are often about fear. Rather than trying something new and maybe failing, it is sometimes more comfortable to hold on to our familiar, impossible-to-solve problem—our anchor. (1466)
- Don’t let this be your story. Be courageous when you have to be. Remember, courage isn’t the absence of fear; courage is action in the face of fear. (1469)
### Gravity Problems: (1472)
- These are both gravity problems because, in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life, and, while it might be a drag and it probably is unfair, it’s like gravity. It’s not a problem because there’s no effective action you can take, and if you can’t take action, it can’t be “solved.” (1476)
- The key is not to get stuck on a problem that you effectively have no chance of solving. (1479)
- This is an “accept first” gravity problem because there’s no there there (just like there’s no there there in trying to repeal the law of gravity). Once we accept the problem, we are free to ask John what he really wants, and it’s obvious—to write poetry. (1489)

- The point is that you are in charge of how you define your problem and how radical a design solution you are willing to build. (1508)
- If you get confused about the difference between anchor and gravity problems, remember that with an anchor you are stuck on a solution, and with gravity you are stuck on a non-problem. (1514)
- And by this definition, gravity and anchor problems aren’t really “problems” (i.e., actionable challenges) at all. They’re either circumstances or unattainable solutions masquerading as problems, and in so doing they are keeping you stuck. (1516)

## The Minimum Actionable Problem (MAP) Toolkit (1521)
## Best Doable Option (BDO) Exercise (1542)

# 4 My Overwhelm Is Overwhelmed - Dysfunctional Belief: I can’t possibly do all this work, and I’m overwhelmed. Reframe: I chose my way into this and I can design my way out. (1560)

## Everyday Overwhelm (1617)
- General overwhelm comes in a few different flavors. (1618)
- Flavor one is what we like to call the “Hydra Overwhelm.” (1618)
- Jobs that have too many parts, or too many people to report to, are often unmanageable and can lead to overwhelm. (1619)
- Flavor two is called the “Happy Overwhelm.” This is where you just have too much of a good thing and too many cool things to do, and you mistakenly volunteered to do them all. (1632)
- Both Hydra Overwhelm and Happy Overwhelm are pretty straightforward and in fact share the same solution—with slightly different implementations. You need to do less and get control of your time. (1634)

## The Nine-Headed Monster (1638)
- You’ll probably surprise yourself once you start brainstorming ways to reduce your task list or connect more with your coworkers. (1648)
- The best way to get the solutions you need approved is to start with empathy for your boss’s needs, and frame your requested change in those terms. (1651)
- The only way to change your Hydra Overwhelm situation is to change something. Figure out what small incremental move you could make—the one with the greatest impact and the most probable endorsement from your boss—and give it your best shot. (1662)
- whether you have to ask for permission to try something or not, you are the initiator. And initiation is one of the things you’re keeping track of with your Good Work Journal, right? (1688)

## So Much Happy (1690)
- Since you chose all of the things that are overwhelming you, Happy Overwhelm often comes with more flexibility and a higher degree of electiveness to your options. (1691)
- The number one solution to Happy Overwhelm is delegation. (1692)
- If you really want to get a lot of time and energy back, you should give away your most prized and high-visibility activities. Those are the easiest ones to find takers, and giving them away frees up a lot of time. (1696)
- Of course, we are not just workers. Sometimes, when you have Happy Overwhelm, you need to delegate some stuff at home. (1703)

## SHOUT-OUT TO SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS—AVOID THE OWNER’S TRAP (1731)
- You own the how of the company as well as the what—and that sense of personal ownership and responsibility can keep you in a special brand of stuck. (1735)
- Step 1: Remember You Are Still in Charge. (1748)
- What subtly happens over time is the business gets in charge of you—not you in charge of the business. (1749)
- Step 2: There’s Only One Rule—Obey It! (1753)
- In any business or institution, whether it’s for-profit or nonprofit, there is only one inviolable rule—don’t run out of money. (1754)
- As an owner, you can literally do anything you want as long as you can afford to keep the doors open (and pay your taxes, not break laws, etc.). (1758)

## Hyper-Overwhelm—a Special Case (1770)
- This is where management and staff are building the plane and trying to fly it at the same time. There are no organizational norms to follow and very little support infrastructure (in fact, that may be one of your jobs—build the support infrastructure—but who has the time?). (1772)
- Being a leader or early team member in a small business or high-growth start-up is not for the faint of heart, nor does it make for short workdays. If this is the path you are on, try to think of your day-to-day work as a marathon, not a sprint. (1775)
- What that really means is you need to implement a particular version of storytelling’s “good enough for now” story, through a reframe and possibly some negotiated compromises with key people close to you (we’re seldom in this situation alone). (1777)
- You see, what’s going on in a Hyper-Overwhelm situation is that lots of good things are happening but there are way too many of them. And you’re not in a situation like a Happy Overwhelm, where you can actually delegate out, because there’s nobody to delegate to. (1809)
- The moral of the story is that the way you manage Hyper-Overwhelm, assuming you choose to be in this “start-up,” is to change the story. (1822)
- One important caveat: You are not alone! You see, when you’re in Hyper-Overwhelm, there are almost always other people affected. For your new story to work, you want them in on the deal. They need to be willing to say, “It’s working for me now, too.” (1828)
- If you can get your key partners, intimates, and collaborators to join you in temporarily embracing your Hyper-Overwhelm, things will go much more smoothly for everyone. (1830)

## Getting Over Overwhelm (1839)
- Check if you’re actually burned out or overwhelmed by reviewing the burnout indicator questions. If you think you are headed for burnout, put the book down and immediately find yourself a therapist specializing in burnout and get good support. If not burned out, continue. (1844)

# 5 Mind-set, Grit, and the ARC of Your Career - Dysfunctional Belief: I don’t like my job, and I don’t know what to do. Reframe: You have the power to reframe and redesign any situation and any job. (1879)
- There’s only one place you can get job satisfaction. (1891)

## Who’s the Boss of Me? (1895)
- You are the creative agent in your life, and you have the power to make the changes that you need and want. It will take some effort and it may take some time (because we’re going to set the bar low and sneak up on these changes), but ultimately the answer to that question is clear. (1903)
## Grow Your Mind-set (1908)
- Carol Dweck suggests that people can generally be divided into having two ways of thinking about life, two dominant mind-sets—fixed and growth. (1909)
- A fixed-mind-set person believes that their intelligence and abilities are fixed, natural “talents” that cannot be changed. (1910)
- a growth-mind-set person believes that, although everyone starts with different natural abilities, their intelligence and talents can be developed. They can learn and master new things. (1914)
- People with a growth mind-set tend to be more persistant and more willing to work hard to achieve a goal, even if they aren’t very good at it when they start. (1921)
- There is even some evidence from fMRI scans of the brain (one way to see which brain circuits are active during a task) that these mind-set differences are neurological. (1922)
- The fact that a fixed or growth mind-set seems hardwired in our brain does not mean that we are doomed to those constraints. There is a lot of evidence that your brain can wire up new circuits in response to training. (1930)
- Studies show that adopting and developing a growth mind-set will increase your desire to learn (curiosity), your embrace of challenge, your ability to learn from criticism and the examples of others, and also your ability to see hard work and practice as the path to mastering anything you set out to do. (1932)

### Dysfunctional Belief: I’m not good at math and I’m never going to get better. There are a bunch of things I can’t do, and there are people who are far more talented than I am. I’m stuck with my abilities and I can’t get better. Reframe: That’s your fixed mind-set talking, and it’s not telling you the truth. The truth is, with a growth mind-set and a lot of hard work and practice, you can probably accomplish almost anything you set your mind to. Talent isn’t the reason other people are doing so well; they are working hard to get better. (1935)

- The fixed versus growth mind-set story is a little too binary. Research shows that we are all a mixture of fixed and growth mind-sets, and we operate somewhere on a continuum from one to the other. (1940)
- The first step is learning to identify when you slip into a fixed mind-set. Ask yourself what triggers this way of seeing the world. (1944)
- To reverse the process, get good at noticing when your fixed mind-set is in charge—do not judge it, just notice. Next, use the power of reframing to change your problem and utilize the power of your storytelling mind-set to “change the narrative, change the outcome.” (1949)
- The final step in moving more toward a growth mind-set is to ask yourself, What can I learn today? Can I reframe the challenges of my to-do list around the objectives of learning and growth? And can I use what I learn in the service of others—can I be a teacher today? (1960)

## Getting Gritty (1968)
- Angela Duckworth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, has developed a way of measuring grit, and you can take the Grit Scale test here: angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale (1973)
- It is the ability to persevere that separates the successful from those who quit. (1977)
- There are four factors that Duckworth calls “the psychological assets that mature paragons of grit have in common.” (1979)
  1. Everything starts with enjoying what you do. To persevere, you need to be intrinsically interested in your subject (more on intrinsic motivation coming up). We’d add the designer’s mind-set of curiosity, a potential precursor to interest, to this asset. (1981)
  2. Next comes the capacity to practice. You must devote yourself to the kind of deliberate and well-informed practice that leads to mastery. And you must practice, every day, every week, every year—there is no end to practice—it is an end in and of itself. (1984)
  3. Third is purpose. You have to believe that your work matters to something and someone greater than yourself. (1987)
  4. And, finally, you have to be a hopeful person. Hope is what keeps you going even when things get tough and your plans aren’t working. Hope is related to optimism and a deeper sense that your mission is ultimately possible. (1989)
- Cultivating your curiosity and interests, practicing hard to become a master at your craft or subject, defining your purpose in something greater than yourself, and remaining hopeful will lead to an increase in your grit and your ability to accomplish what you set out to do. (1991)

## The ARC of Your Career - Dysfunctional Belief: I’m not happy in my job, and I have no idea how to make it better. Reframe: I recognize my intrinsic motivations and I know how to increase my autonomy, relatedness, and competence. (2000)
- At the end of the workday, we are the one responsible for making our job feel challenging and fun. (2003)
- The research on human motivation, called “self-determination theory,” says that we are intrinsically motivated animals, and, in addition to responding to external motivations, a full understanding of human motivation requires an understanding of our innate psychological needs for Autonomy, Relatedness, and Competence (ARC). (2005)
- Autonomy, at its most basic, is the need to control our own life. (2026)
- We all want to be in a position at work where we are able to control aspects of what we do, who we do it with, and when we do it. (2027)
- At work, you develop your autonomy by showing up in the work that you do and deciding to do it as good or better than is required. When you get in the habit of overdelivering on the job, good things start to happen. (2030)
- Relatedness is about connecting to your people and your community. (2048)
- We develop and sustain our relatedness by engaging with our fellow workers, collaborating well on projects, and being empathetic to the needs of those we work with and work for. (2048)
- Competence is just what it sounds like. (2081)
- We develop our competency by (and there is an element of grit in this one) practicing our craft until we have achieved what others would call mastery, and then going on to “out-master” ourselves through even more concerted practice. (2082)
- There are two common areas where we need to invest in growing our competency: our areas of natural strength that are useful in our work and our areas of natural weakness, which are required in our job. (2087)
- When there’s a gap between your skills and your job’s requirements, make it an opportunity to grow. It takes a lot of work, but on the other side are terrific benefits for you and those you work with and serve. (2103)
- Everyone has these motivations, and when you can satisfy these motivations at work, you are likely to do your best work, feel more connected to your colleagues, and experience your work as meaningful. This is what it means to develop the ARC of your career. (2113)

## SHOUT-OUT TO MANAGERS (2116)
- As a manager, you can design opportunities for your employees to experience autonomy, relatedness, and competence. (2116)
- It costs anywhere from 20 percent to 200 percent of an employee’s salary to replace that employee, with the highest number being spent to replace key employees, managers, and executives. These costs aren’t reflected in your bottom line, but can be measured in lowered productivity, decreased morale, and increased stress, all leading to the potential burnout of your staff. (2122)
- If you think your employees are leaving over money—think again! People don’t quit jobs—they quit bosses. (2126)

## Passion Is Not the Starting Point (2128)
- research shows that passion is generally something that emerges in response to working hard in an area of interest. (2130)
- Our advice is to concentrate on designing a job you love, right now—which includes one that maximizes your growth mind-set, builds up your grit, and pays attention to your internal and intrinsic motivators—and the odds are good that you will find your passion in it. (2150)

# 6 Power and Politics - Dysfunctional Belief: I do not understand how things work at my job; it’s all about the office politics. Reframe: I can learn how to succeed by learning how to manage influence, authority, and power. (2203)
- Ask yourself, any time you’ve seen something change where you work, what happened just before that change? The answer is a decision. (2214)
- So, ask yourself, What is required at work to make a decision? It’s not time, or luck, or good looks. It’s authority. (2218)
- Influence that matters acts on the people with the authority who are making decisions, often by providing an informed opinion on the pros and cons of the decision in question. (2226)
- So if you’ve been influential on a decision that resulted in a change, your influence was well received by the authoritarians. That is a form of power in any organization. (2227)
- At the core of it, the true definition of politics is the wielding of influence. (2232)

## The Power Potpourri (2236)
- Now for a little 2x2 model: In the Influence and Authority chart on this page, you can have a lot of authority or not much, or you can have a lot of influence or not much. (2238)
- We have influential authoritarians (IA), we have non-influential authoritarians (NIA), we have influential non-authoritarians (INA), and the non-influential non-authoritarians (NINA). (2241)
- Most people are NINAs—they are valuable and important but not necessarily influential in the making of big decisions. (2250)
- NIAs are people who are relatively high up in the organization, but they’re not particularly influential. They’re not necessarily people in charge of terribly important stuff. (2253)
- INAs are the influential non-authoritarians. These are people in the organization who get listened to. (2262)
- Last but not least, we have people who are both authoritative and influential. These are people who get listened to because they have important things to say, and they have positions of authority so they can make decisions. These are the real power players. (2272)

## The Value Proposition (2282)
- Influence is therefore the sum of the value you contribute and the recognition you get from contributing that value. (2285)
- Influence = Value + Recognition (2286)
- When we’re talking about politics, we’re talking about the wielding of influence, the kind of influence that acts on authority, authority with the power to make decisions. And that influence comes from a very legitimate place; it comes from the real value you create, strategically and culturally aligned, for your organization. (2288)
- Well, a decision-maker will listen to you if she thinks you have good ideas that will help the company do more valuable things and be more successful. (2295)
- So how do you become an influencer? It’s really simple. You add value to the organization, meaning you help it be more successful, by being useful and doing great work. (2299)
- It is important that the value you add is strategically aligned with the organization’s direction and is recognized by people who can do something about it, the ones with the authority to make decisions. (2300)
- If you add value and nobody knows, that’s a noble contribution, but it won’t make you influential. (2302)

## Bad Politics (2307)
- There are generally two ways that bad politics can happen. (2310)
- The first is when someone in the organization pulls a power play. (2310)
- And the second is when there’s a values crisis in the company. (2311)
- First, let’s distinguish between a power play and a power struggle. (2311)
- A power struggle is when people with legitimate opinions get into a conflict about what the right thing to do is. (2312)
- In a power play, somebody’s not trying to do the right thing for the company, they’re trying to do the right thing for themselves. (2319)
- When you are experiencing challenges to your business model and don’t know what to do, when you are not really sure what a good decision looks like, that’s when organizations, large and small, run into a values crisis. In this case, the equation Influence = Value + Recognition no longer works, because we’re not sure what “value” really means. (2327)
- And when you don’t really know (1) why you are failing and (2) what to do about it, you don’t have a strategy. And that’s when you get chaos and a crisis of values. (2332)
- When you don’t know how to make a good decision, you make decisions randomly. (2334)
- Our advice: You want to be careful in those situations to make sure you don’t get caught up in the mess. You have to stay close enough to the situation to know what’s going on, but not so close that you get burned. Most bad political scenarios don’t last long. (2347)
- Just be a savvy political observer and keep adding value that’s visible to the right influencers and authorities—something good will come of it. (2350)

## Organize This (2352)
- The power/influence scene at work is never static; things are always in motion. (2369)
- If you’re making more and more and more value contributions, you go further and further into the power zone. You become more influential. If you make less of a value contribution, you start sliding out. (2372)
- So a smart designer reframes his or her understanding of his or her organization to match this three-dimensional, moving system and works to increase his or her power and influence. And that is how things get done in business. (2374)

## FOR THE SELF-EMPLOYED: (2377)
- Sure, you don’t live inside a traditional organization and no one keeps sending you updated org charts, but you almost assuredly work within organizations. (2379)
- The reason is simple. As a contractor, you have no authority power in the organization. (2382)

## Using Your X-ray Vision (2389)
- With your new X-ray vision, you can identify, understand, and recognize who is and who is not an influencer, and you can see how influence affects decisions, even if you are not in the room when the decision gets made. (2392)
- And once you start getting the hang of relating to and wielding influence more effectively, then you might want to try your hand at pulling off one of the most powerful moves you can make in your career—redesigning your job right where you are. (2450)
- The Power-Sort Exercise This is a very simple and often surprisingly insightful exercise. Draw a 2x2 table and label each quadrant IA, NIA, INA, and NINA, as shown. (2453)
- Think about an ongoing issue you’re encountering at work (like the EMR project at Pete’s clinic), and to the left of your box write the names of all the people involved—even peripherally—in that issue. (2456)
- Then ask yourself the following questions: 1. What do you notice? 2. Did anyone end up in a box that surprised you? 3. What information do you need to complete assigning people to boxes? (2460)

# 7 Don’t Resign, Redesign! - Dysfunctional Belief: I have a bad job, and I need to quit! Reframe: There are no bad jobs, just jobs that fit badly, and I can redesign right where I am to make my own “good” job. (2471)
- Designers don’t get stuck, because they know how to get unstuck. (2477)
- You’ve got a couple of things going for you right there where you are—in the job you now have and in the company that knows you. If you’ve worked for any significant amount of time in your company, you’ve most likely developed a solid internal network and support system. You also know in detail all the things that are right and wrong where you are. (2484)
- Depending on your circumstance, one of these strategies should help you get unstuck. (2492)
  1. Reframe and reenlist to the job you have by finding a different story for and relationship to your work, crafted by realigning your activities around your organization’s priorities—making you more valuable in the process. (2494)
  2. Remodel your job through a combination of cosmetic and structural modifications that better align with your interests while utilizing more of your signature strengths, resulting in improved performance that makes your boss happier and improved engagement that makes you happier. (2497)
  3. Relocate. Slide laterally into a new role that’s within reach, even if it’s not obvious at first. Either it’s an existing opening or a new position created just for you. (2501)
  4. Reinvent. Launch a new career. It’s the You 2.0 Program, but at the same company, in a completely different kind of role for which you’ve prepared and retrained to give you a major career refresh and your employer continued access to a loyal and valuable team member. (2504)

### Dysfunctional Belief: My job sucks, and I need to go to another company to get a better one. Reframe: Before you quit, make sure that you have maximized all of your available options in place where you work. The better job (or gig) you seek may be the one right next to you. (2507)

## Caveat—the Toxic Workplace WARNING: SOME JOBS ARE NOT WORTH IT! (2517)

## Your Secret Weapon (2528)
- You are a known talent at the company and, even if you have outgrown your current job, you are inherently a less risky hire than an outsider. (2535)
- And, since you’re a good life designer and you have nurtured your internal network, you probably have some advocates for your talents and potential. (2536)
- One caveat: All of this advice assumes that you’ve had some success in your current position and that you have advocates and supporters where you work. So now is the time to take a hard look at your performance on the job and assess your assets and liabilities. (2539)
- A generally understood management principle is: Don’t transfer problems, fix them first. (2544)

## Strategy #1—Reframe and Reenlist (2547)
- Let’s start with the easy part, which is—you end up just keeping your current job but liking it a whole lot more. (2548)
- Now for the harder part—which is coming up with a reframed relationship with your job that enables you to successfully reenlist and go forward more happily. (2550)
- The strategy of reframe and reenlist is all about how to make the best of a difficult situation. (2628)
- It’s quite straightforward: (1) Accept the new reality. (2) Identify new sources of “why” that you can use as your rationale for your job. (3) Reframe your relationship to the job and company. (4) Reenlist and live into it. (5) Look for new benefits and sources of satisfaction along the way to make it good enough…for now. (2631)

## Strategy #2—Remodel (2634)
- start with what’s already happening at work that you most enjoy, then prototype doing more of it in ways that make it easy on your employer to like what you’re doing. If it works, just keep building your way forward to a more joyful job. (2681)
- Know Your Strengths The CliftonStrengths Assessment is a test that you can take online that teases out what Donald Clifton’s research calls your signature strengths. (2711)
- Knowing your signature strengths is useful because the data is clear that people who can practice their signature strengths at work are viewed as more successful. (2718)
- The CliftonStrengths Assessment helps you identify your signature strengths. If you can then redesign your job to take maximum advantage of your strengths, the data shows that you’ll probably be happier and enjoy the contribution you’re making—which means you are more likely to find your work meaningful. (2725)

## Strategies #3 & #4—Relocate or Reinvent (aka: The Internal Job Search) (2783)
- The approach is essentially the same in both instances, with a fork in the road before the final steps. In both relocate and reinvent, you are pursuing a new job in a new area—not a direct extension of your existing role (that would be Strategy #2: remodel). (2788)
- In relocate, you are making a sideways move that you can slide into from where you are without extensive preparation or retraining. (2789)
- In reinvent, you are really making a big shift—one where your prior experience isn’t very transferable and you’re going to have to make some serious investment in preparing or retraining to get that job. (2791)
- Both relocating and reinventing use the same simple four-step process based on our design mind-sets. Get curious. Talk to people. Try stuff. Tell your story. (2798)
- When Relocate Becomes Reinvent (2863)
- The lesson is—be honest with yourself about your situation. Do your homework, get curious, and talk to people, so you know what’s really required of the job change you want to make before asking others to give you a shot. When it comes time to tell your story and ask for that new job, you want to be ready to tell a winning story. (2871)
- Grad school is the solution if and only if you have identified the right problem to solve. (2911)
- Folks go to grad school to get some combination of these four things: (2921)
- Expertise. (2923)
- A network. (2927)
- A pivot. (2933)
- You get permission to be a different kind of person when you retrain at grad school. (2933)
- You can sometimes pivot without grad school, but the world still believes that having a graduate degree makes you more credible. (2939)
- A badge. (2942)
- Ultimately, you have to decide whether or not the time and money are worth it to buy a new degree. Just be sure you know how you value each component of what you’re getting—the expertise, the network, the pivot, and the badge. (2951)
- Life design is just that—it’s design, which means iteration and lots of prototyping. (2991)
- At some point, it’s natural, we all outgrow our jobs. If you are a bright, creative person, and you have a designer’s mind-set of curiosity and a bias to action, you will probably grow your skills and abilities faster than the job you’re in. (2997)
- If you are in a healthy organization with an advocate for a boss, the organization will recognize your abilities and collaborate with you to find a new, more challenging role for you. (3000)

# 8 Quitting Well - Dysfunctional Belief: I’m going to quit this *$#$%* job today. Reframe: I’m going to springboard out of this job to a better one by designing my quit. (3045)

## Bridge burners (3055)
- Never quit in anger, and never leave without giving the company time to figure out what it’s going to do once you’re gone. (3059)

## two-week lame duck (3065)

## Generative Quitting (3085)
- We therefore suggest reframing quitting as a chance for you to author a great final chapter for your old job en route to writing the first great chapter in your next. (3088)
- Generative quitting can be a great design experience, one that leads to an even better understanding of who you are and what really motivates you. (3090)
- Prerequisites 1. Try redesign first. 2. Ask the boss. 3. Choose quitting. 4. Find a new job first. (3092)
- Generative Quitting Steps 1. Leave the campsite better than you found it. 2. Rev up your network. 3. Set up your replacement to win. 4. Exit well. (3098)

## Try Redesign First (3108)
- Even if the redesign doesn’t pan out, the time you’ve spent trying is never wasted. After applying your design thinking process to the problem, you’ll have learned a great deal about yourself and about your company (and therefore about your entire industry), and you’ll have a better story to tell as you start your new job search. (3111)

## Ask the Boss (3114)
- The point is, you never know what’s really going on, what’s really motivating people, until you ask. So before you quit, have that conversation with your boss. Ask one simple question. “What am I doing wrong?” (3139)
- And then just listen. Do not get defensive and do not argue—listen with as much empathy for your boss as you can muster (we know this is hard). And then maybe do the same thing with your boss’s boss. Who knows what you’ll discover? (3141)

## Choose Quitting (3143)
- What we mean is—you choose quitting. Don’t let quitting choose you. Make quitting your positive, generative choice. (3146)

## Find a New Job First (3152)
- There are two good reasons to find a new job before you quit: (1) it improves your chance of landing that new job, and (2) it increases financial stability. (3152)
- 1. Employers respond four times more often, give out twice as many interviews, and extend three times as many offers to employed folks versus unemployed applicants. (3154)
- 2. Don’t forget about the money. Being unemployed is expensive. (3162)

## Leave the Campsite Better Than You Found It (3170)

### Rev Up Your Network (3199)
- Radical collaboration, the “asking for help” mind-set, is a critical mind-set for any designer, but it is especially important when you are quitting well. You should do everything you can to preserve and expand your network of friends and colleagues, both inside and outside where you work, before you leave. (3200)
- Make the connections tangible and touch base; a handwritten note, thanking someone for their time or being helpful, is always appreciated (handwritten notes are such a lost art). (3206)
- The more people you reach out to and connect with, the better. (3208)

### Set Up Your Replacement to Win (3214)
- This setup involves two things: getting rid of any messes that you don’t want lying around (with your name on them!) so that the new person has a good clean start, and documenting the key insights, procedures, and contacts necessary to do your job well. (3218)
- This sounds harder than it is. You’re not writing a 128-page manual, you’re just documenting, in one convenient place, the insider knowledge you’ve collected on the way to being successful in your job. (3221)
- This includes things like: Regular meetings, activities, and reports the job demands Reliable, helpful people with special knowledge to solve certain kinds of special problems Any pressing issues that you’re dealing with right now Old problems that were solved but might reawaken if not checked now and then If you had people working for you, a short summary of the strengths of each of your direct reports, so that their new boss starts with a positive impression of her new staff (3222)
- The next time you quit—write a Quick Reference Manual to being you and you’ll blow your boss away (and expect the person who takes your old job to call and thank you for it). (3234)

## Exit Well (3235)
- When you quit, you are writing the screenplay of the final scene of the movie of your job. It is going to be one of the strongest memories that your company and the people in it have of you. Be sure it’s a great scene that you want people to remember. (3237)
- Be clear and concise and emphasize the positives about your future challenges. (3243)
- It’s not hard to do this right. Give yourself a good script and, most important, stick to it. You’ll be glad you did. (3249)

# 9 Moving On - Dysfunctional Belief: My last job didn’t work out. I’ve got to start all over from scratch and find a new one. Reframe: I can springboard from wherever I am to the next place, taking the best with me and leaving the rest behind. (3359)

## It’s All About the Story (3374)
- Here’s a simple but profound reframe: The best way to get a job is not to ask for a job, it’s to ask for the story. (3374)
- it all starts with get curious and talk to people. The most effective way we know of to pursue and land new job opportunities starts with prototype conversations, rooted in sincere curiosity, with professionals in your area of career interest. (3376)
- The next step in finding a job is for you to spend another one, two, or three months having lots of interesting conversations with lots of interesting people—most of whom aren’t currently hiring—so that you can connect into the conversation about hidden jobs, somewhere along the way. (3379)
- Job descriptions are at best shorthand for what is really needed to be successful on a job, and are not always written by the people doing the hiring. (3403)

## Cracking the Hidden Job Market (3408)
- In the United States only 20 percent of all the jobs available are ever made public. (3409)
- The hidden job market is visible only to people who are already connected to the network of professional relationships in which those jobs reside. (3412)
- As a sincerely curious person and someone not looking for a job, you can become an insider through connections built by getting the story. Then, once you become part of the “job community” conversation (and, remember, interested is interesting), things start to happen. (3417)
- When you’re out there “getting the story,” you are just a curious person who’s talking to interesting people doing interesting things in a field of work you’re interested in. You are not a job-seeker (yet), which is why you are such an easy person to talk to. (3429)

## From “Get the Story” to “Get the Offer” (3437)
- More than half the time, when the approach we’re recommending results in an offer—they start it. You don’t have to. (3441)
- If for some reason they don’t start it for you, and you have completed seven to ten prototype conversations, and you have found an organization that you are really interested in, you can ask one question that will convert the conversation from their story to your offer. (3442)
- As soon as you ask “What steps would be involved in exploring how someone like me might become a part of this organization?” Allen knows it’s time to shift gears and start thinking about you as a candidate. (3445)
- The what would be involved in exploring how question is open-ended (not yes or no) and invites possibilities far beyond jobs that might be immediately available. (3448)

## Get Ready, Get Curious, and Get Out There (3488)

# 10 Being Your Own Boss - Dysfunctional Belief: The only way to have a career is for someone to hire me, and to work for a company, in a job I can tolerate. Reframe: One way to have an amazing career, with lots of autonomy, and have a job I love is to invent it! (3512)
- We’ll start by reframing these gigs, side jobs, and consulting engagements as “prototyping for money.” (3531)
### Dysfunctional Belief: I don’t have a real job—I’m just doing temporary consulting—and this isn’t the career I thought I’d have. Reframe: I’m not doing temporary work; I’m prototyping alternative ways of working and being my own boss, for money. Prototyping is a low-risk way to get curious, try stuff, and take control of my work life. (3536)

## Prototyping for Money (3540)

## Sneaking Up On Your Future (3565)
- We recommend building a simple, fast prototype of what it’s like to be a consultant. (3569)
- And the future is already here—someone in the world is already doing the consulting you want to do. So let’s get curious and go talk to them. (3573)
- Here’s a process for building your first consulting prototype. (3574)
- In this first prototype, we are asking the question “What does it feel like to be a consultant?” (3575)
- Start with curiosity—about the work you might do, what skills you can offer the world, and about consulting and what’s involved in getting started. Brainstorm a list of things that you know how to do, things that might be “consultable.” (3578)
- Let your curiosity drive the next step—setting up prototype conversations. (3580)
- Now narrow down the options for the “consultable skills” you brainstormed. Pick one version of your “consulting story,” one that contains your “offer” and why working with you is unique and compelling. (3586)
- It takes a lot of work to market and sell consulting services. We will get to that in the next prototype; this time around we are going to keep it simple. Set yourself up on one of the many digital platforms where clients post projects. (3591)
- Bid on one simple, small project, doing something you already know how to do and something you are genuinely good at. (3597)
- Once you’ve locked in the project, spend extra time on it, even more than your bid, to make sure that you nail it. This prototype is about learning and building your professional reputation, not making money. (3600)
- Once the project is complete and the reviews are in, it’s time to reflect. (3602)
- Ask yourself, What did I like about the project? What didn’t I like? Do I agree with my client’s feedback? How could I have done the project better, faster, with less effort, so that I can make more dollars per hour next time? (3606)
- Assuming that you liked the experience, or at least didn’t hate it, try it again. (3608)
- While working on projects that come from these large aggregator sites is relatively easy, it’s hard to charge premium rates because of the quality of the clients (folks looking for cheap consulting) and the intense competition for project work. At some point you want to manage your own marketing and sales efforts so that you can differentiate your services and make more money. Here’s how you do that: (3611)
- Now that you have a few projects under your belt, refine your story and come up with a better way to tell people about what you do, and what makes your service or product delightful and extraordinary. Again, keep it simple and powerful, no more than 250 words. (3615)
- Build a prototype Facebook or LinkedIn page, or, better yet, your own simple website, and tell your new story digitally. Buy a couple hundred dollars’ worth of targeted ads that describe your services to the specific audience that you think wants to hire you. (3617)
- Prototype your story (your “marketing message”) and your service offerings (what you do and deliver for your clients) one or two more times—do some A/B testing (3628)
- Every time you win a project, you have set a new bar for your hourly or project rate. You now have hard evidence that the right kind of client will pay a certain amount for your service. Your goal is to get enough projects in the pipeline that you can increase your rate each time you make a proposal. (3631)
- After a few months of these activities, and a few more successful projects, stop and reflect on the process and your results, and decide if you want to do it again. (3635)
- Another one of the mind-sets of a designer that comes into play now is awareness. (3636)
- Let’s take a look at what we’ll call the “workflow” of that business, and what a solid business plan looks like if you want to thrive in this new way of working. (3638)

## Ride the Workflow (3640)
- Your first business plan doesn’t have to be overly complicated. Here’s a super-simple business plan template that anyone can master. It’s just six steps: (3645)
  1. Go back and figure out what you are good at (empathy for you) and what the world needs (empathy for your potential clients), and ask the questions “Is there a sweet spot between what clients need and what I know how to do? If so, can I address this sweet spot with my consulting offering?” (3647)
  2. Decide what will distinguish your special version of “getting the job done.” (3652)
  3. Set up a workflow (see this page) that is repeatable, scalable, and measurable (you’ll want to know if you are getting better). (3655)
  4. Accept that to charge a premium for your service, you have to get good at sales and marketing; that’s how you will build a sustainable business. (3657)
  5. Once you get good at the workflow of consulting, and have developed a stable of repeat clients and have lots of great reviews and referrals, you can start raising your rates. (3660)
  6. Once you get really good at your business, see if there are parts of your workflow that you can hire out to “gig workers” who charge less than you. Outsource these nonessential activities, and mark up these services, generally 10 percent to 30 percent, and build this cost into your next proposal. (3662)
- To get this ball rolling you need to do a lot of personal marketing and outreach, maybe through social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. (3681)
- You succeed based on your marketing savvy, your empathy for your clients, and your ability to turn current clients into referral sources. (3689)
- How do you get to charge the highest price for your time? It’s all about telling your story. (3694)
- Most people who are new at being their own boss make the same mistake. They think it is all about “doing the job.” It’s really not. It is about telling your story, again and again. (3694)
- So it’s time to accept that telling your story, which is all that marketing is really, is part of being a successful “boss.” (3697)

## Be Extraordinary (3699)
- The data indicates that the average self-employed worker makes less money than they would if they had a full-time job. (3701)
- The truth is: People who make extraordinary offers end up with extraordinary clients. (3708)
- And when you have designed your customers’ experience to be extraordinary and delightful, you find yourself working with people who are happy to work with you. (3710)

## The Customer’s Journey Map (3741)
- A journey map describes the entire experience of finding and experiencing a product or service, and maps out the customer’s journey over time. (3745)
- With a journey map you can identify points of friction that can be designed out. In addition to eliminating friction, a good journey map identifies places where you can change the game and delight your customers, we call these “magic moments.” (3746)
- Our simple journey map visualizes the journey of the customer on a timeline, divided into three columns. The “Before” column describes how your clients find out about you, the “During” column is about the experience of your product or service while it’s happening, and the “After” column is about the service and support you provide after the client’s job is complete. (3753)
- In addition, our simplified journey map has three rows. (3757)
- “Activities” are listed on the top row—a detailed list of all of the activities that occur before, during, and after your service or experience. (3757)
- The middle row is labeled “Emotions,” and it charts the emotional roller coaster of your client. (3758)
- The bottom row is called “Magic Moments,” and it contains sketches and pictures of moments of delight that you’ve designed into your customer’s experience. (3761)
- Once you’ve designed your client’s personal journey with your service, you can start prototyping the “magic moments” that you’ve designed into your map. Take these moments one at a time and make sure you survey your client each step of the way so that you can measure their satisfaction with your service. (3774)
- You are trying to increase client conversion, client satisfaction, and referral rates—and the best way to do that is to really understand their experience. (3776)
- Living a life of creative prototyping, and working with people who you like and admire—that sure sounds like the blueprint for a job well designed. And a well-lived, joyful life. (3779)

# 11 All Disruption Is Personal - Disruption is everywhere and disruption is always personal. That’s why these last chapters of the book focus on you—the individual, the mom, the dad, the worker, and the boss. Our scale of change is YOU, (3862)

## Things Will Never Be the Same Again (3882)
- Disruptions are changes—big changes. While all change requires some adaptation, they don’t all rearrange your life. (3882)
- Anything that makes it feel like you’re a very different person or you’re now living in a very different world is a disruption. (3892)
- Which is why we call it Disruption Design. In today’s reality, if you want to build a well-lived and joyful life and thrive at work, you need to be able to recognize a disruption and design your way through it. (3912)
- The good news is that regardless of what the disruption is, the mind-set of a Disruption Designer is the same (which is the same as the mind-set of any good human-centered designer—it just demands a huge level of acceptance to embrace a massive, unwanted, and challenging change). And the overall process of Disruption Design is the same for all true disruptions. (3918)

# 12 Now Where Are We? (3922)
- The Waiting Room is the natural place to go when an emergency occurs. When you hear the sirens, you pull the car over and you wait until the trouble passes you by. (3932)
- Just a ticking clock awaiting the restart of normalcy. (3935)
- There are lots of times in life when the Waiting Room is a totally appropriate place to be, but it’s a disaster during a disruption. (3935)
- Remember that our definition of a disruption is a change after which you recognize that things will never be the same again. (3937)
- Naturally, what we all want when big change arrives is to move from the Old World into the New World as quickly and painlessly as we can. (3938)
- The only problem is—it doesn’t work like that. It’s not a two-step process with the new following closely on the heels of the old. It’s a three-step process, and the middle phase—the gap in between the old and new worlds—is the one we want to focus on. (3941)
- Well, when in doubt, designers look to Design Thinking and Design Thinking has at its core one infallible tenet: Just Be Human. The original, technical name of Design Thinking is Human-Centered Design. (3947)
- The fundamental truth is that if you get the human part right, you can’t go wrong. (3949)
- Here’s how we suggest a Disruption Designer might think about it. Design always starts “here.” (3956)
- And as we stated before, the “HERE” most people feel they are in after a disruption is the Waiting Room. It’s the natural human response. It’s where we all begin. (3958)
- The first step of Disruption Design is to get out of the Waiting Room by reframing it into the Acceptance Zone. (3965)
- The exciting thing is that the Acceptance Zone is brimming with both the not-quite-yet-visible raw material of the coming new reality and a sense of anticipation, almost of time itself being on tiptoe, looking for the new world to emerge. (3973)
- the first and necessary stop on your trip to the future is the Acceptance Zone because you’re a human being. And we hate it. We don’t want to be here. It’s scary. It takes some courage to do this. No wonder many people never make it out of the Waiting Room. (3978)
- We are going to acknowledge that (1) we’re in a disruption and (2) the disruption tossed us into the Waiting Room, and (3) we don’t have to be stuck there (3988)

## Disruption Design Goal #1: Generative Acceptance (3991)
- While acceptance is simple, it isn’t always easy. There are three kinds of acceptance: Oppressive acceptance Suppressive acceptance Generative acceptance (3992)
- Oppressive acceptance is what the hapless victims do. (3997)
- Suppressive acceptance is what the stoic heroes do. (4003)
- Both the victim and the hero are avoiding reality by misperceiving it. (4008)
- Generative acceptance is what the Disruption Designers do. A designer takes things just as they are and knows how to design forward. (4008)
- The mind-set of a Disruption Designer starts with acceptance and moves quickly to curiosity. “I wonder…” (4011)

## Where Grief Meets Growth (4017)
- The endings that come with a disruption include losses—often big losses—and that means part of the ending process is grief. (4017)
- Acceptance is always the presumptive start of design because you can’t solve a problem you’re not willing to have. (4022)
- We think it important to note that grief ends where design begins—in acceptance. (4025)
- A powerful catalyst to getting past (if not entirely over) your losses is to start building your way forward into a new well-lived and joyful version of your life. We can grieve our way up to design, then design our way beyond grief. (4031)
- Kessler recognized that getting to acceptance was necessary but not sufficient. People had to make meaning from their losses in order to move on well—and that meaning-making typically took root in how they went forward, integrating the lessons of those losses into their future selves. (4034)
- The Acceptance Zone is also a good place to keep setting the bar low and clearing it with small, energizing design efforts that keep you going and growing and avoid getting stuck in the Waiting Room. (4047)

## Disruption Design Goal #2: Be a Wayfinder to Be Future Ready (4050)
- There are two strategies for how to get from here to there: navigation and wayfinding. (4051)
- Navigation means developing an optimal route based on precise information about where you are (Point A), where you’re going (Point B), and all the terrain in between. When you’ve got this information available, it’s terrific! (4052)
- Wayfinding means making the best guess you can about which direction to try (not which destination to arrive at), then venturing forward for a bit, then stopping and taking note of where you are and what you can see from this new vantage point. (4066)
- Designers are usually wayfinding because they’re trying to invent something no one’s ever done before. (4071)
- Accordingly, designers never fall prey to the myth of efficiency. The myth of efficiency is that whenever you find yourself doubling back over old ground or moving in any direction other than a straight line, you’re wasting time and energy, and you’re doing it all wrong. (4073)
- a wayfinding route like the one above is in fact the shortest distance between the start and the finish of that journey. Really! That long squiggle is what the shortest distance looks like when you’re wayfinding. It’s the shortest distance measured in units of human discovery and prototype iteration—not miles. (4078)
- It’s important not to attempt to navigate when wayfinding is appropriate. (4087)

## Designing in the Acceptance Zone (4095)
- You let the endings from the Old World direct your curiosity (sounds like, “Hmmm, I wonder how new employee orientation will work now?”) and you build your way forward using the simple four-step process we’ve outlined in detail in chapter 7: get curious, talk to people, try stuff, and tell your story. (4096)
- What’s different in the Acceptance Zone is you’re not doing that process to design a new solution for your future work life. You’re doing it to transition through the Acceptance Zone and to make yourself future-ready when you’ve gotten across it and the New World is starting to take shape. (4099)
- In the Acceptance Zone, you don’t yet know where things will end up, but you do know what’s most likely to change. Once you recognize that you’re in a disruption and accept that things will never be the same again, you already know what many of those never-to-be-the-same-again things are. That’s where you start—by getting curious about those things that are undergoing change. (4112)

# 13 Disruption Design (4124)
- The mantra throughout this book has been “set the bar low and clear it.” We believe that the key to success is taking small, proactive steps toward any change you want to make. (4138)
- What’s important is your intention to make the change and your persistence and your grit when it comes to the changing. (4141)
- In times of high stress, when a lot of change is thrust upon you quickly, you need to prioritize your efforts. Pick your problems carefully—you can’t respond to everything with equal force. (4142)
- That’s why it is even more important to pick problems that are real. Problem-finding is the first step in design thinking, and finding the best problems—the most urgent or important ones to work on—is even more critical when the forces of the world seem to be spinning out of control. (4146)

## The New Key Issues (4152)
- Transitioning to Hybrid Work—managing the good and the bad of sometimes working from home. (4155)
- Embracing a Big Shift to Being Trusted and the accountability that comes with it. (4157)
- Upping Your Communication Game to make sure your contribution is recognized. (4158)
- Remodeling Your Job, both the place you do it in and the way you do it. (4160)
- Building Your Design Team. Now more than ever, you need a team, and collaboration with your players, supporters, and intimates is a generative and fun form of radical collaboration. (4162)

## The Office Is Mostly Over (4165)

## Workforce Transformation (4196)
- The downside is that this work-from-anywhere lifestyle is leading to a new kind of overwhelm—we call it the “no boundaries” overwhelm. (4220)

## Daily Experience Redesign (4234)
- Doctors and psychologists agree that we need to break up our workday with some physical exercise, a variety of different kinds of cognitive tasks, and some social contact. (4234)
- Look at your daily schedule, on paper or online, and mark it up to identify four experiences: starting and stopping moments, uninterrupted work time, social time, and physical movement time. (4239)
- In this experience design, Bill makes sure that Starting and Stopping moments are designed in—he has bookended “work” with a social ritual, kissing his wife, and a physical ritual, going down and up the stairs and changing his clothes. These moments in the experience mark the starting and stopping points of his day. (4248)

## What About the Kids? (4262)
- For Dani and other caregivers like her, this is a season of designed overwhelm. Keeping in mind the “set the bar low” method, we suggest that the goal is simply not to get too far behind, to deal with the major stuff first and let everything else go. (4269)
- Studies have shown that even when you have limited resources, feeling like you have the ability to make choices and ration your resources responsibly makes all the difference in the world. (4272)

## The Big Shift to Trust (4275)
- Your manager has to learn to trust you—he or she has no other choice. Be worthy of that trust, be more accountable, and you will reap the freedom to design your workweek in the way that works for you. (4295)

## The Accountability Model (4297)
- As the system shifts more toward accountability, you’ll need to make your work product more visible. (4300)
- You want to make sure that project deadlines are clear (that’s your responsibility, not your manager’s), and you need to schedule your time efficiently so that you deliver to the deadline 100 percent of the time. And if something comes up and you know you can’t make a deadline or a milestone, you need to fess up in advance, before the deadline arrives. (4300)
- The truth is, most deadlines can be renegotiated if there is a good reason to do so, and the key is to handle it before you let people down. (4303)
- Above all, you want to be perceived as predictable—you never surprise your team or your boss with a problem. That’s what accountability looks like. (4305)
- In the new world of accountability, it’s all about deliverables, and these show up in one of two forms—writing, mostly emails and status reports nowadays, and presentations. (4315)

## Design Better Deliverables (4316)
- To communicate effectively, you probably need to amp up your writing skills. A huge percentage of your work product will be documented in emails and status reports. (4317)
- Keeping your emails short and to the point, with a clear takeaway or request for action, is important and a gift to anyone with an overloaded inbox (and that’s everyone). (4320)

## Death by PowerPoint (4327)
- Look, if you have the chance to present your work or your team’s work, you have an obligation to make your presentation understandable, engaging, and effective. (4336)
- As Bill teaches his students, a presentation is always a performance. (4339)
- Every good presentation also tells a story. (4342)
- French-Swiss filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard famously said, “A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but not necessarily in that order.” (4343)
- Christopher Booker, in his book The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories, claimed that there are only seven plots, and these are the backbone of all human stories: (4345)
- 1.Overcoming the Monster (Little Red Riding Hood, Jaws) 2.Rags to Riches (Cinderella, David Copperfield, Rocky) 3.The Quest (The Odyssey, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings) 4.Voyage and Return (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Gulliver’s Travels) 5.Comedy (Shakespeare’s comedies, The Hangover 1, 2, and 3) 6.Tragedy (Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet) 7.Rebirth (A Christmas Carol, Groundhog Day) (4347)
- Whether he’s right or not is not the point. These seven plots make great presentations. (4368)
- Then they must give the presentation to a friend or colleague and ask the friend to write down the three key points that were stressed in the presentation. If the friend fails to name the three key points, they must redesign the presentation and try again. (4379)

## Relentless Remodeling (4390)
- Both during the Acceptance Zone period in any disruption, and again afterward as the next normal starts to settle in, take the opportunity to remodel your job. (4391)
- So look around your current job—notice the changes—and see if you can get curious and reframe those changes into an easily implemented job remodel. It will definitely improve your quality of life, it will better position you for the future once you get across the Acceptance Zone, and it might just save your job from being disrupted out of existence. (4411)
- And we recommend remodeling your job not just in response to a disruption, but relentlessly! (4413)
- The goal is to help you get across the Acceptance Zone not just in one piece, but in great shape and ready to engage the new beginnings. One of the difficulties of the Acceptance Zone is that while we’re in it, we tend to feel helpless. We don’t really know what’s going on (and during a big disruption, neither does anyone else), and we don’t know when the next normal is going to happen. It can be pretty discouraging, especially if it goes on for a long time. (4417)
- Ambiguity is always hard. Ambiguity dragging on and on is utterly draining, and drained is not a good mind-set for a designer. (4425)
- That’s what we mean by relentless job remodeling—little changes that you make frequently, over and over and over again. It’s all about exercising your personal agency to remind yourself of the power you have to change things. (4427)

## When Remodeling Isn’t a Metaphor (4439)
- While you’re relentlessly remodeling your workstyle, and since you are likely to be working from home at least some part of the week now and in the future, make a little investment in your workspace. (4440)

## Reinvention on Steroids (4467)
- If you find yourself in a situation where not only will what you used to do never be the same again, it won’t even be again, then you’re facing a Reinvention on steroids. (4474)
- Reinvention is Redesign Strategy #4 from chapter 7. It’s the hardest, slowest, and most costly of the four strategies (Reframe and Reenlist, Remodel, Relocate, and Reinvent), but when the situation demands it, it’s the only one that works. (4475)

## On Steroids Means Do It Twice (4499)
- The special challenge of cracking into a whole new sector is figuring out which sector to approach and finding people to talk to who will give you a chance to try stuff and tell your story. (4499)
- Set the bar lower. The first goal is to find an interesting sector and craft your new story. The second goal is to then crack into that sector and use that story to network your way to a new job. (4502)
- She remembered to ask every contact for other contacts and ended every live inquiry with the power question: “Thanks so much for your time. I have just one last question. If you were me, what would you do next?” (4520)
- Then she went back to the people she’d met for a follow-up conversation focused on specific topics of interest in their field. (4526)
- All still just exploring these industries and types of businesses—not looking for a job. (4531)
- Now Anna was well enough informed to articulate effectively and meaningfully how she could contribute to these kinds of organizations. (4532)
- That’s when she started her second round of getting curious, talking to people, trying stuff, and telling her story. But this time she was asking for a much more focused story (remember, the best way to get a job is ask for the story), and when the time was right to tell her story, she had a great one ready to present about how she could contribute in a job role that she knew they needed. (4540)

## Design Team—Beyond Ideation to Load Sharing (4550)
- In our first book we talked about the importance of building a design team to support your professional work and your life journey. We reframed this as “You live and design your life in collaboration with others,” and we talked about three kinds of teammates: Players, Supporters, and Intimates. (4551)
- Players are the active participants in your life design projects—in particular your ongoing work-related redesign projects and prototypes. (4553)
- Supporters are those go-to people you can count on to care about your life. They are the people close enough to you that you rely on their encouragement to keep you going. They are particularly good folks to bounce ideas off of and your go-to source for high-quality feedback. (4555)
- Intimates include your immediate and extended family members and your closest friends. These are likely the people most directly affected by changes in your life design. They are the most influential people in your life, and you’ll want to communicate with them a lot. (4560)
- A healthy team is more than two people and not more than six, including you. We recommended in the first book, and we still agree, that one extra-large pizza should be able to feed your whole team. Optimally your team would be three to five people. (4564)
- A design team is essential when you are in the ideation phase of your life design. (4566)
- You get the idea—having a design team you can count on will provide you with the support that you need (that we all need) to thrive. Don’t be afraid to ask for what you need—that’s why you’re on a team. And pay it forward by offering to help out your teammates when you can. (4572)

## Checking In (4576)
- Your work (indeed, your life) is a marathon, not a sprint, and you need the support of your creative team to be successful and to thrive. (4580)
- At the Life Design Lab and on every teaching team that Bill and Dave are part of, every meeting, even short ten-minute stand-ups, starts with a check-in on the personal stuff that has happened since the last meeting. (4581)
- The way you create psychological safety is though sharing, without judgment and with affirmation, what’s important to you on a human level. (4586)
- We always use a prompt for the check-in, just to help people get started. Some good prompts are: What was the highlight of (your day, yesterday, your weekend)? What was one thing you learned recently? Give us three words that describe how you are feeling today. You get the idea; the prompt is something specific, not too personal, and not about work. (4587)
## Reframing Community (4593)
- As we pointed out in our first book, healthy communities are always about something. Communities come together around a shared interest or affiliation. (4593)
- Yes, we all got isolated in many ways and from many communities, but by reframing our idea of what community looks like, we can design our way forward and build virtual communities that can keep us connected in all the ways that matter most. (4604)
- So what does virtual community and video chatting with family have to do with job Disruption Design? Now more than ever, we realize that work and life are not separate things. You will show up to get the job done better when you are emotionally supported and connected, having a community and a team you can count on. (4610)
- In addition to starting and stopping moments, mark up the following on your current calendar: meeting times, uninterrupted working times, socializing times (this can be with colleagues or with family and friends), and physical movement and exercise times. (4619)
- If you don’t schedule it, it will not happen! (4621)
- In any case, take advantage of your new freedom to schedule a work life that meets your needs, week by week. (4627)
 Presentations (4629)

# 14 The Humans in the Room (4650)
- So whether you’re a small business owner, a corporate manager, a team leader, or just a person who drew the short straw and is in charge of the crew this afternoon, here are some Disruption Design ideas we hope you find useful. (4661)

## The Leadership Challenge (4666)
- For the first time in the history of the modern workplace, we are now all revealed to be something more than our job. We are all revealed to be humans. (4678)
- Becoming more human at work doesn’t necessarily change the work itself or change the content of the work-related conversation. (4685)
- It’s that change in who we see others at work to be (be it peers, employees, bosses, or customers) that invites an opportunity to lead differently—to lead more humanly—and if that doesn’t quite make sense yet, to certainly lead with more humanity and compassion for the humans in the room. (4687)

## Zoom Out to Zoom In (4690)
- Start with just increased personalization in the transitions into and out of conversations. (4695)
- There is great power in doing segues and transitions with both business effectiveness (the well-run and organized meeting) and personal attentiveness (the more human meeting). (4700)
- Once you’ve gotten comfortable with using a more human touch, you can up your game. This next opportunity is largely focused on one-on-one conversations. In those conversations, try Zooming Out—opening the conversation briefly to a broader scope that includes things beyond work. (4702)
- When we’re all in something together—in a pandemic disruption or any kind of disruption—there’s an increased opportunity for expressing our shared humanity. (4709)
- Allowing for that simple connection and human recognition improves trust and authenticity. (4711)
- That Zoom Out (asking how the family is doing) allows the Zoom In (getting the business taken care of) to work better and feel more meaningful to everyone because it allows work to be more a part of an undivided life rather than an isolated and disconnected activity. (4711)
- And you can go one step further with Zoom Out to Zoom In, if it fits you, your situation, and your employee. For this step, you actually have a “how’s life?” conversation with the employee, not just a transitional comment. (4713)
- Managers can care about the whole (work and personal) lives of employees and care about their home-office hybrid situations without having to take care of those things. (4715)
- It’s okay for workplace leadership to facilitate employees’ experience of getting clearer on how to build their engagement, coherency, and meaning-making at work without intervening into their values or violating their privacy. You can provide tools and processes that help them to figure it out without having to know or judge the specifics. (4727)

## Assets, Not Artifacts (4736)
- How do you project your leadership and authority without the corner office and the big desk? (4736)
- You shift from artifacts like appearance or office size to assets like how well you run a meeting, how effectively you are managing from a distance, and what your performance and deliverables look like. (4741)
- Leadership assets include the following types of things. (4754)
- Production assets Sales Reports Plans and budgets Programs Products and services Process assets Workflows Procedures Paths of promotion and professional growth Communications (in person, in print, online) Human assets Approachability Candor, sincerity, authenticity Reliability Confidentiality Compassion (with appropriate boundaries) Availability and rapport Trustworthiness Emotional intelligence, self-control (4756)
- All these assets are critical, and it’s time to make a thorough inventory and start stocking up on what you need. (4775)

## Easier Than Ever (4776)
- While getting together at a mixer event or a big conference is hard, if not impossible, getting together one-on-one is easier than ever. (4781)
- People’s schedules have never been more available, and never before have they been more inclined to talk to you than now. So talk to them! (4791)
- work has given back to you in regular one-to-ones. Research has made very clear that the single highest correlate to having a positive experience in college is having direct and regular interaction with a faculty member or staffer who cared about you and your work. That’s an observation about people, not universities, and it applies in the work world just the same as it does in colleges. (4794)
- Whether you’re a manager or not, take this golden opportunity to up your one-on-one interactions. Make a commitment to reaching out to colleagues not only when you have a problem needing a solution, but also when you have curiosity about their work. (4799)
- And while you’ll usually need to schedule these interactions in advance, you can still get the bumped-into-her-in-the-lunchroom serendipitous conversation. It won’t literally be by accident like in the old days, but it can be unscheduled. (4801)

## Harder Than Ever (4817)
- The explosion of remote work may have resulted in direct meetings getting easier, but on the flip side of that, onboarding new staff and building company community and culture is much harder. (4817)
- The challenge faced by someone new trying to crack into a well-established network is described fairly accurately by the Mark Knopfler song that says, “Sometimes you’re the windshield / Sometimes you’re the bug.” If you’re the new person, the existing network is that impenetrable windshield and you feel like the bug about to go splat when you hit it.

- Once upon a time on your first day, the boss would introduce you around to everyone and openly remind people of your role and the importance of bringing you into the fold. (4833)
- If you’ve got a good boss, some time during that first week you’ll be handed off to a network mediator who will be responsible for making sure you get properly connected. (4836)
- That way of getting people integrated into the team was heavily dependent on being together. (4840)
- And the best way to manage the hard task of onboarding and integrating new team members is to use breakouts to break in. (4843)

## Breaking Out to Break In (4845)
- While remote, online communications may make midsize to large-sized group interactions (anything over six people) seem less personal, they actually can make small group interactions (three to six people) more intimate. (4845)
- Establishing a good rhythm back and forth between the plenary group and breakout groups during any meeting of an hour or more will do wonders to help build community in the workplace. (4859)
- And if you’re the new employee and your managers don’t do this, you can do it for yourself. (4860)
- identify what small groups of people it would be helpful for you to debrief with further to address follow-up considerations, and invite them to a short meeting to coordinate. (4862)
- Keep it to just three to six people, so you have a chance to connect personally, and keep the meeting short—twenty minutes or less to address a very specific question or action item—so that you’ve got a much better chance of getting their attention. (4864)

## Gathering for Good Reasons (4868)
- There is no one right answer to when it’s critical to get people face-to-face. What is critical is that the organization’s leaders figure this out and support it. (4877)
- It may be for ideation—allowing people to leapfrog off one another’s ideas and experience the dynamic of a high-performing team hitting a state of flow and coming up with the killer ideas that make all the difference. (4878)
- It may be for celebration—getting the group together to acknowledge and celebrate the hard work, specific contributions, and important outcomes delivered by various teams and individuals. (4880)
- It may be for communication and alignment—periodically having everyone in the room and getting fully informed on the current status of projects and pending priorities, including an open floor for questions, concerns, and pushback. (4883)
- It may be for customer acknowledgment—bringing together providers and buyers or users of products or services in order to see and touch the lives that are actually affected by what workers do day in and day out. (4885)
- There are countless good reasons to make the effort to gather in person, and you can probably already guess how we suggest you find out for your organization what your good reasons may be. It’s four steps: Get Curious. Talk to People. Try Stuff. Tell Your Story. (4887)

## But Does It Actually WORK? (4892)
- Is there evidence that a well-executed hybrid organizational design works? (4892)

## Engagement Matters (4905)
- And now more than ever, designing our work life is all about creating work and work environments that facilitate more engagement. (4911)

# Conclusion Permission to Be Happy (4956)
- You are the creative designer of your life. How you spend your days is how you spend your life. You are never stuck. (4960)
- Whether it’s a small change in you or the job, or a huge global disruption, you always have at least some move that you can make to design your way forward and build toward more thriving and aliveness. (4961)
- We often think that work frustration, overwhelm, disengagement, disruption, and burnout are personal problems. It’s our job and our fault if it’s not working, or our boss’s fault, or someone’s fault. The truth is, it’s not a personal problem alone. It’s a societal problem and a global problem. Disengagement at work is epidemic, and the reason is that our organizations are filled with dysfunctional beliefs. (5013)
- The one thing we know with absolute certainty is this: Life’s too short to be disengaged at work. And life’s too precious to be disengaged at life. (5024)
