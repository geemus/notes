Part I Who Was Pierre Wack?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 1 Pierre Wack’s Personal Motivation to “See” >  Page 6
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Wack was an advocate of relentless curiosity, and he was a man genuinely interested in the world. He promoted the utility of intuition and the magical flashes of insight that emanate from stilling the mind in Zen meditation, yet he simultaneously prioritized facts and the ability to perceive them accurately. On this topic, Wack was fond of quoting Paul Valery, the twentieth- century French philosopher. He said, “Un fait mal observe est plus pernicieux qu’un mauvais raiseonnement.” A poorly observed fact is more treacherous than a faulty train of reasoning.

Wack would retell this story many times throughout his career to communicate some of the key purposes of scenario planning— changing your state of mind, hearing a sound deeply, striking the mental models of managers like the stone against the bamboo— these are all powerful images he used to get ideas across.

Wack’s metaphor of the company as an animal using its claw or beak is a perfect example of what was so engaging about him. And it was a preview of his later interest in competitive positioning. Companies could behave like animals to take advantage of their assets. They could run and hide— take care of their corner of their habitat. Or dominate and attack— again based on their assets and strengths. And every company is likely to employ all of these techniques at some point.

<div class="noteText">
The other major discovery in the early evolution of scenarios was the difference between exploratory and focused scenarios. Wack even called these “mini- scenarios” later on. He further emphasized that they were faster to create and easier to work with than the more macro exploratory scenarios. But Wack was clear that if you jump directly to the focused scenarios, you miss key elements— particularly the predetermineds. This led Wack to a tiered scenario approach— you start with the exploratory learning scenarios and then zoom into the focused decision scenarios.

In Pierre’s view the main purpose of scenario thinking is to come to a point where one sees the world as no one has seen it before and the potential for a new strategy is born. Scenarios can do that for you, but it is not a trivial matter. It certainly is not, in Pierre’s opinion, a mechanistic process in which one works through a predetermined set of steps during one or two workshops. Instead it is a process of long- lasting commitment to deep thinking about the situation, a willingness to find out what the world already knows, and a willingness to engage with what Pierre called “remarkable people,” not necessarily experts but people who enjoy looking at the situation in multiple and unexpected ways.

At Shell, he was an insider, and even though he was eccentric, he had an oil mental model, and an economist’s mental model. He was using his network of remarkable people to ensure his own biases didn’t rule the scenario work for which he was responsible.

Mental models became perhaps the most lasting and central feature of Wack’s scenario approach when he realized that the early scenario attempts failed because they had no connection to managers’ deepest concerns. He knew he needed to find a way to make the link.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 185
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Wack began interviewing managers as the first step of scenario work. He spent the rest of his career refining and developing his interview craft, determined to be able to see inside the minds he was trying to change. Understanding the mental models gave him valuable knowledge about how people framed their experiences, and their decision making tendencies.

Finally, Wack concluded that if scenarios did not link to present day decisions, only half of the exercise was complete.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 185

Studying peoples’ mental models through interviewing reveals the things foremost on their minds. It is equally important to identify the critical decisions right at the start of any scenario effort.

<div class="noteText">
Probabilities are more of a nuisance than a help in the non- trivial process of communicating scenarios to management. By focusing on the outcome instead of developing an understanding of the forces leading to an outcome, they will have a superficial and mechanical impact, and will not change management mind- sets in depth. More important, in the development of the scenario, the use of probabilities seems to direct the attention and efforts of the scenario designer in the wrong direction.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 187
</div>
<div class="noteText">
There are two opportunities for significant development in scenario planning that come directly from Wack’s unfinished work. They focus on generating management options, and “footprints,” both of which Wack described in his final presentations to the Operating Companies in 1982.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 187

<div class="noteText">
However, these two underutilized tools can support the connection between scenarios and decision making— Wack’s own ultimate intent.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 187
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The message is clear— identify real decisions and their related options early on in the scenario work, and remain open to new options that may emerge from the hard work of developing the scenarios.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 187
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Footprints appear more complicated than they are— the idea is to assess options within and across the scenarios and display that assessment visually.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 187
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Imagine a simple set of options. For each option, the risk and potential benefit could be approximated by a ranking from 1– 10. Option 1 could have a ranking of 8 on risk, and 10 on potential benefit.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 188
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The outcome is a scatterplot, in which each data point represents an individual’s assessment of the option. The process must be replicated in two ways: first, for each scenario (because the dynamics of each scenario would be different, and therefore the rankings would change), and second, for each option.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 189
</div>
<div class="noteText">
It is easy to see how a process like this can connect scenarios to decisions, and seeing the footprint move in the different scenarios provides unique information for decision makers. Yet, it does not appear to be a tool commonly used with scenarios, and it remains an opportunity to evolve scenario methods in new direction. The example here used risk and benefit as the main parameters; however, almost any variables could be used. Cost, timeline, financial return, capital expenditures, cost of energy, cost of labor, product price, etc. would all be useful assessment dimensions depending on the context and decisions.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 189
</div>
<div class="noteText">
We live in a world of great impatience and lack of commitment. Decision makers want answers and recommendations quickly, as if insight can be achieved through a rote process which simply needs to be executed more efficiently. But experience has taught again and again that insight and innovation do not work that way.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 10 What Can Be Learned from This Remarkable Life? >  Page 189
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The antidote is equally simple. If serious insights about the future are expected to come from scenario planning, it must become a dedicated function inside the organization. And it requires support and patience to develop the function— insights will not come overnight.

If we have a decision to take we confront the alternatives of behaviour with this mental image. And when a man takes good judgment, takes good decisions people say he has good judgment. In fact he has largely a mental map, a mental image, which is a good match with the real world.

What, in time, we can to learn was that these first- generation scenarios are always learning scenarios; their purpose is not action, but to gain understanding and insight.

Another insight later gained was the importance of naming the scenarios.
