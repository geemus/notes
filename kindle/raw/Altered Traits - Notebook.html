Only mindfulness of their breath both lowered activity in the amygdala— mainly via a faster recovery— and strengthened it in the brain’s attentional networks, while the patients reported less stress reactivity.

Zen meditators seemed to respond to pain as though it was a more neutral sensation.

Researchers are, appropriately, skeptical about such traitlike findings because self- selection in who chooses to stick with meditation and who drops out along the way might also account for such data; perhaps people who choose to meditate for years and years are already different in ways that look like trait effects.

The reason: their brains had stronger operative connectivity between the prefrontal cortex, which manages reactivity, and the amygdala, which triggers such reactions.

when Richie’s group divided the seasoned meditators into those with the least hours of practice (lifetime average 1,849 hours) and the most (lifetime average 7,118), the results showed that the more hours of practice, the more quickly the amygdala recovered from distress. 22

In the format for loving- kindness that Sharon helped bring to the West, you silently repeat phrases like “May I be safe,” “May I be healthy,” and “May my life unfold with ease,” first wishing this for yourself, then for people you love, then for neutral people, and finally for all beings— even those whom you find difficult or who have harmed you.

These various mind training methods drive the brain in different ways. During compassion practice, the amygdala is turned up in volume, while in focused attention on something like the breath, the amygdala is turned down. Meditators are learning how to change their relationship to their emotions with different practices.

The amygdala’s circuits light up when we are exposed to someone feeling a strong negative emotion— fear, anger, and the like. This amygdala signal alerts the brain that something important is happening; the amygdala acts as neural radar detecting the salience of whatever we experience. If what’s going on seems urgent, like a woman screaming in fear, the amygdala has extensive connections to recruit other circuitry to respond.

Meanwhile the insula uses its connections to the body’s visceral organs (like the heart) to ready the body for active engagement (increasing blood flow to the muscles, for example). Once the brain primes the body to respond, those who have meditated on compassion are more likely to act to help someone.

Unlike other benefits of meditation that emerge gradually— like a quicker recovery from stress— enhancing compassion comes more readily. We suspect that cultivating compassion may take advantage of “biological preparedness,” a programmed readiness to learn a given skill, as seen, for instance, in the rapidity with which toddlers learn language. Just as with speaking, the brain seems primed to learn to love.

The cultivation of a loving concern for other people’s well- being has a surprising and unique benefit: the brain’s circuitry for happiness energizes, along with compassion. 19 Loving- kindness also boosts the connections between the brain’s circuits for joy and happiness and the prefrontal cortex, a zone critical for guiding behavior. 20 And the greater the increase in the connection between these regions, the more altruistic a person becomes following compassion meditation training.

Compassion, she found, muted the empathic distress that can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout (as happens sometimes in the caring professions like nursing).

By zooming in on details of sights, sounds, tastes, and sensations that we otherwise would habituate to, our mindfulness transformed the familiar and habitual into the fresh and intriguing.

Conclusion: mindfulness (at least in this form) strengthens the brain’s ability to focus on one thing and ignore distractions.

Another way cognitive control helps us is in managing our impulses, technically known as “response inhibition.” As we saw in chapter five, “A Mind Undisturbed,” in Cliff Saron’s study the training upped a meditator’s ability to inhibit impulse over the course of three months and, impressively, stayed strong in a five- month follow- up. 17 And better impulse inhibition went along with a self- reported uptick in emotional well- being.

In short, our mind wanders mostly to something about ourselves— my thoughts, my emotions, my relationships, who liked my new post on my Facebook page— all the minutiae of our life story. By framing every event in how it impacts ourselves, the default mode makes each of us the center of the universe as we know it. Those reveries knit together our sense of “self” from the fragmentary memories, hopes, dreams, plans, and so on that center on I, me, and mine.

The rule of thumb: the brain of a novice works hard while that of the expert expends little energy.

The results: certain areas of the brain seemed to enlarge in meditators, among them: The insula, which attunes us to our internal state and powers emotional self- awareness, by enhancing attention to such internal signals. Somatomotor areas, the main cortical hubs for sensing touch and pain, perhaps another benefit of increased bodily awareness. Parts of the prefrontal cortex that operate in paying attention and in meta- awareness, abilities cultivated in almost all forms of meditation. Regions of the cingulate cortex instrumental in self- regulation, another skill practiced in meditation. The orbitofrontal cortex, also part of the circuitry for self- regulation.

The degree of improvement was about as much as for medications, but without troubling side effects— making mindfulness- based therapies a viable alternative treatment for these conditions.

This suggests a lessening of the psychological component— like the worry we feel in anticipation of pain— along with intensification of the pain sensations themselves.

The variety of compassion may matter. Here the practitioners were engaged in “nonreferential” compassion. In the words of Matthieu, they were “generating a state in which love and compassion permeated the whole mind with no other discursive thoughts.” They were not focusing on any specific person, but rather were generating the background quality of compassion; this may be especially important in engaging the neural circuits that tune the brain to the heart.

Another point. We expect that the lightening of self and lessening of attachment in the yogis would correlate with a shrinking of the nucleus accumbens, as was found in long- term Western meditators.

The massive levels of gamma activity in the yogis and the synchrony of the gamma oscillations across widespread regions of the brain suggest the vastness and panoramic quality of awareness that they report. The yogis’ awareness in the present moment— without getting stuck in the anticipation of the future or ruminating on the past— seems reflected in the strong “inverted V” response to pain, where yogis show little anticipatory response and very rapid recovery. The yogis also show neural evidence of effortless concentration: it takes only a flicker of the neural circuitry to place their attention on a chosen object, and little to no effort to hold it there. Finally, when generating compassion, the brains of yogis become more connected to their bodies, particularly their hearts— indicating emotional resonance.

Beginners also find improvements in attention very early on, including less mind- wandering after just eight minutes of mindfulness practice— a short- lived benefit, to be sure.

One important difference about meditation on retreat is that there are teachers available who can provide guidance— like a coach.

Mindfulness, for instance, has the meditator witness whatever thoughts and feelings come and go in the mind.

And Dzogchen and Mahamudra include both in early stages— and a host of other meditation types— but end in a “nondual” stance, resting in a more subtle level of “meta- awareness.” This raises a scientific question about the vector of transformation: Can we extrapolate insights from mindfulness and apply them to vipassana (a traditional segue), and from vipassana to the Tibetan practices?
