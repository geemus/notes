</div>
<div class="noteText">
Dr. John Ratey, an expert on how the brain functions, suggests that ADHD is the result of dysregulation of the reward system (primarily dopamine) in the brain. In short, the brain of a person with ADHD does not move dopamine and other chemicals in the attention areas of the brain in the same way that the brain of someone without ADHD does.

<div class="noteHeading">

Drs. Russell Barkley, Kevin Murphy, and Mariellen Fischer have studied how to appropriately translate the current child- centered criteria for diagnosing ADHD to adults.

Dr. John Ratey, a leading expert in both ADHD and the brain, suggests that ADHD can be thought of as a reward- deficiency syndrome created from a deficit of specific pleasure neurotransmitters (most importantly dopamine, but also serotonin and endorphins) that are used to indicate reward in the attention centers of the brain. He notes that without these chemical indicators of reward, people with ADHD have trouble completing tasks that reward only after a long period, such as doing well in college to obtain a better job.

For a longer discussion about whether to take medication, as well as an overview of alternative treatment options, I suggest that you consult Hallowell and Ratey’s Delivered from Distraction.

<div class="noteText">
Dr. Ned Hallowell compares living with ADHD to driving in the rain with bad windshield wipers at about 90 miles per hour. Every once in a while, things are very clear, but most of the time you’re not completely sure what’s coming at you— and it’s coming fast!
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 19

<div class="noteText">
The ADHD brain has few filters on it; often, everything enters at once, and in a big jumble.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 21
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Living with ADHD is somewhat like having a race- car brain that lacks good brakes. Impulse control is a huge issue; people with ADHD often have minds that go fast and have trouble stopping when they need to.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 22
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The joke is that there are really only two time zones for a person with ADHD: “now” and “not now”! A person with ADHD is very present focused.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 24
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Though not true in all cases, people with ADHD often have trouble planning ahead. Planning means organizing a number of different options into a workable game plan and anticipating what will happen in various scenarios.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 24
</div>
<div class="noteText">
One of the major differences between how people with and without ADHD lead their lives has to do with how they experience time. This is more than just a symptom or two. People with ADHD are notoriously late because they can lose track of time, and they are often terrible judges of how long it will take them to complete a task.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 26
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When I hear or read a string of related ideas, my brain immediately “filters” them into a hierarchy.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 26
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The ADHD brain receives information quite differently. Instead of being hierarchical, I like to think of it as “flat.” Everything, important or not, initially receives about the same amount of attention.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 27

<div class="noteText">
It is unfortunate that one of the recurring experiences for individuals with ADHD is personal criticism or comments about how they just did something stupid.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - ADHD and Its Diagnosis >  Page 27
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Unfinished projects (distraction), poor decision making (impulsivity or too much information to process), memory problems, and more mean that people with ADHD often fail to do things as quickly as or in the same way that those without ADHD do them.

Although his wife was at that very moment wallowing in despair over his treatment of her, he perceived things to be fine between them. This isn’t because he is dense; it’s just that after a lifetime of having people mad at or disappointed with him, Dan weathers periods of anger and criticism by mostly ignoring them. And, because people with ADHD don’t receive and process information in a hierarchical way, Maria’s suffering enters his mind at about the same level as everything else he perceives—

Then, create a new relationship in which you and your spouse work together on “today” and “tomorrow.”

One spouse, let’s say a wife with ADHD, speaks for a short while-- the equivalent of one paragraph. Then her husband repeats what he thinks he heard in his own words, without adding commentary. If he has it right, then it’s his turn to speak. If he hasn’t gotten it quite right, she elaborates to explain what he missed, and he mirrors it back until he fully understands what she said. Then it’s the husband’s turn. He speaks briefly in response to his wife’s original idea or question, and they reverse roles.
