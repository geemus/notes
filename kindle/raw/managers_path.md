# The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change by Camille Fournier

## Chapter 1. Management 101 (138)
- What to Expect from a Manager (1)
- There are, however, other options. Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback. Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday. And most importantly, managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus. (2)
- One-on-One Meetings (2)
- 1-1s serve two purposes. (2)
- First, they create human connection between you and your manager. (2)
- The second purpose of a 1-1 is a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing. (3)
- I encourage you to share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager. Come with an agenda of things you would like to discuss. Prepare for the time yourself. (3)
- Feedback and Workplace Guidance (3)
- The second thing to expect from your manager is feedback. (3)
- Ideally, the feedback you get from your manager will be somewhat public if it’s praise, and private if it’s criticism. (4)
- Asking your manager for advice is also a good way to show that you respect her. People like to feel helpful, and managers are not immune to this sort of flattery. (4)
- When it comes to your role at the company, your manager needs to be your number one ally. (4)
- It’s great when managers can identify and assign stretch projects that will help us grow and learn new things. (4)
- Beyond assigning stretch projects, though, good managers will also help you understand the value of the work you’re doing even when it is not fun or glamorous. (4)
- Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work. (5)
- As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback you get, both good and bad, is likely to decrease. You are operating at a higher level, and your manager is operating at a very high level. Expect the type of feedback to change somewhat from personal feedback to team- or strategy-related input. (5)
- Training and Career Growth (5)
- As the main liaison between you and the bureaucracy of the company, your manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth. (5)
- The other way your manager will contribute very directly to your career growth is via promotion and, probably, compensation. (5)
- In whatever way promotions happen, your manager should have an idea of whether you are qualified to be promoted. (6)
- How to Be Managed (7)
- Spend Time Thinking About What You Want (7)
- Whether you are brand new to the workplace or 20 years into your career, the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on your shoulders. (7)
- You Are Responsible for Yourself (8)
- Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want. (8)
- Advocate for yourself. (8)
- When your manager isn’t helpful, look for other places to get help. (8)
- When you are persistently unhappy, say something. (8)
- Give Your Manager a Break (8)
- Your relationship with your manager is like any other close interpersonal relationship. The only person you can change is yourself. (9)
- Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems. (9)
- Try not to make every 1-1 about how you need something, how something is wrong, or how you want something more. (9)
- Choose Your Managers Wisely (9)

## Chapter 2. Mentoring (10)
- Being a Mentor (12)
- Mentoring an Intern (12)
- Listen carefully (13)
- One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand. (14)
- Clearly communicate (14)
- Calibrate your response (15)
- Mentoring a New Hire (16)
- Mentoring new hires is critical. Your job as a new hire mentor consists of onboarding, helping this person adjust to life in the company effectively, and building your and her network of contacts in the company. (17)
- This is an opportunity for you to see the world of your company through fresh eyes. (17)
- Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires. (17)
- Mentoring a new hire by helping her work through the documents, and having her modify those documents with any surprises she encounters during onboarding, provides a powerful message of commitment to her. It shows her that she has the power and obligation to learn, and to share what she’s learned for the benefit of your whole team. (17)
- Part of the mentoring opportunity here is the chance to introduce the new person around. (18)
- Even if you have absolutely no interest in management, it’s very difficult to build a career at any company with multiple teams without building a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas with. (18)
- Adopt the mindset that network building is a worthwhile investment of your time and energy. (18)
- Technical or Career Mentoring (18)
- If you find yourself in one of these relationships, the best thing you can do is be specific about your expectations and goals around it. (19)
- When you are a mentor (19)
- Tell your mentee what you expect from him. (19)
- It’s also OK to say no to mentoring. (19)
- When you are a mentee (19)
- Think about what you want to get out of this relationship, and come prepared to your sessions. (19)
- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek (20)
- The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear. (20)
- The alpha geek habit often starts to show up when engineers first become mentors. (21)
- Tips for the Manager of a Mentor (22)
- What you measure, you improve. As a manager you help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals. (22)
- First of all, figure out why you are setting up this mentoring relationship in the first place. (22)
- Secondly, recognize that this is an additional responsibility for the mentor. (22)
- Whatever the source of the mentoring arrangement, common mentoring pitfalls include viewing it as a low-status “emotional labor” position, assuming that “like” must mentor “like,” and failing to use the opportunity to observe potential on your team firsthand. (22)
- It’s worth continuing the investment through to fruition by recognizing that mentoring is work that takes time, but also yields valuable returns in the form of better employee networks, faster onboarding, and higher internship conversion. (23)
- Finally, use this opportunity to reward and train future leaders on your team. (23)
- Key Takeaways for the Mentor (24)
- Be Curious and Open-Minded (24)
- Listen and Speak Their Language (25)
- Make Connections (25)

## Chapter 3. Tech Lead (26)
- My job as tech lead was to continue to write code, but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the project management process. (28)
- When my team at Rent the Runway created our engineering career ladder, we consciously chose to define the role of tech lead as a set of characteristics an engineer could take on at many points on the ladder, rather than a specific level. (28)
- They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are empowered to make independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult management and leadership situations. They are also learning how to partner effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business. (29)
- Perhaps a better shorthand for this is the description used by Patrick Kua in his book, Talking with Tech Leads: A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team. (29)
- tech leads will be working on one major new technical skill: project management. (29)
- Being a Tech Lead (30)
- Being a tech lead is an exercise in influencing without authority. (30)
- So not only do I have to influence my peers, but I also have to influence up to my manager to ensure we are prioritizing the right work. (30)
- Becoming a tech lead required me to change my focus. Work is now less about me and working on the most technically challenging idea or the most fun project; instead, my focus is more on my team. (30)
- All Great Tech Leads Know This One Weird Trick (31)
- the biggest trick of being a good tech lead: the willingness to step away from the code and figure out how to balance your technical commitments with the work the whole team needs. (31)
- Being a Tech Lead 101 (31)
- The Main Roles of a Tech Lead (32)
- Systems architect and business analyst (32)
- identify the critical systems that need to change and the critical features that need to be built in order to deliver upcoming projects. The goal here is to provide some structure for basing estimates and ordering work. (32)
- Project planner (32)
- Project planners break work down into rough deliverables. (32)
- This can be tough because you are probably used to thinking about only your own work, instead of the work of groups of people. Finding places to apply agreed-upon abstractions to enable parallel work is key. (32)
- At this stage, you will want to gather input from the experts on your team, and talk to the people who know the affected parts of the software deeply, so that they can help with the details here. (32)
- You will also want to start identifying priorities as part of this process. (32)
- Software developer and team leader (33)
- Software developers and team leaders write code, communicate challenges, and delegate. (33)
- In your position as tech lead, you should continue writing code, but not too much. (33)
- Start looking for opportunities to delegate work, especially if there is part of the system you expected to build yourself that you have not had the time to tackle. (33)
- Managing Projects (34)
- As you move forward in your career, you need to understand how to break down work that has complexity beyond the scope of what you can do as an individual. Project management for a long-running, team-based project is not what most people consider fun. (35)
- Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly, that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens. (36)
- The plan itself, however accurate it turns out, is less important than spending time on the act of planning. (36)
- Take the Time to Explain (37)
- I’ve always been surprised how grateful senior technical managers have been when I can explain some very basic modern ideas (e.g., what’s this NoSQL stuff all about, and why should I care?) to them in a nonthreatening and noncondescending way. (37)
- I never hesitate nowadays to take the opportunity to explain basics and motivation to senior or junior members. It educates them without making them feel small, they learn to trust my judgment and advice, and we bring about change. (37)
- Managing a Project (38)
- Break down the work. (38)
- Push through the details and the unknowns. (38)
- Run the project and adjust the plan as you go. (38)
- Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirements changes. (39)
- Revisit the details as you get close to completion. (39)
- Decision Point: Stay on the Technical Track or Become a Manager (40)
- Imagined Life of a Senior Individual Contributor (40)
- Your days are spent in a mix of deep thinking, solving hard problems that challenge you intellectually but are still fun and novel, and collaborating with other deep thinkers. (40)
- In short, you have the perfect balance of engaging work, fame, and accumulated expertise that makes you invaluable and respected, highly paid, and influential. (41)
- Real Life of a Senior Individual Contributor (41)
- Still, you get to build things most of the time. You get to spend your time focused on technical problems, systems design, and engineering issues, and you don’t have to do all that much dealing with people or sitting in boring meetings. (42)
- Imagined Life of a Manager (42)
- You have a team, you have control, you can make the decisions, and you can finally get others to do things your way. Your team respects you and is happy to yield to your authority in all matters. (42)
- In short, you get to make decisions, you create the culture, and your effectiveness is evident to all around you, making your path to promotion quick and your career exciting and lucrative. (43)
- Real Life of a Manager (43)
- You have a team. You have some control, but you’ve quickly discovered that getting people to do something is harder than just telling them to do it. You seem to have given up all control over your own day-to-day. Mostly you spend all day in meetings. (43)
- You can make decisions — well, some decisions. (43)
- You do set the standards for culture on your team, which is good and bad. It’s good when they take after your best aspects, and it’s bad when you realize that your team is also mirroring your faults. (44)
- Your team does not naturally just agree with you, respect you, or even like you. You realize that authority requires more than a title. (44)
- Still, you can see that your work matters to some of them, that they are happier and more successful because of your coaching. (44)
- The politics of figuring out how to lead without undermining your peers or your boss are trickier than you expected. (44)
- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar (45)
- The process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems. (45)
- focus, time management, and prioritization. They try to stop all work while they search for the perfect process, or constantly push new tools and processes on the team as solutions to the messier problems of human interactions. (45)
- The opposite of the process czar is not a manager who gives up on process completely, but rather someone who understands that processes must meet the needs of the team and the work. (45)
- As a new tech lead, be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on your team. (46)
- How to Be a Great Tech Lead (46)
- Understand the Architecture (46)
- Be a Team Player (46)
- Lead Technical Decisions (47)
- Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve. In all of these cases, make it clear what the matter under discussion is, and communicate the outcome. (47)
- Communicate (47)
- Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team. Often, this means that you pay the price of communication overhead. (47)
- Don’t forget to listen during all of this communication. (47)

## Chapter 4. Managing People (49)
- Part of your focus throughout this period of adjustment to management is to figure out your own management style. (49)
- Starting a New Reporting Relationship Off Right (50)
- Build Trust and Rapport (50)
- One strategy is to ask a series of questions that are intended to help you get to know the aspects of the person that impact your ability to manage him well. (50)
- Create a 30/60/90-Day Plan (51)
- The more senior the hire, the more he should participate in creating this plan. You want him to have some clear goals that will show whether he’s learning the right things as he gets up to speed. (51)
- Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation (51)
- Communicate Your Style and Expectations (52)
- Get Feedback from Your New Hire (52)
- One final piece of advice: get as much feedback as you can about the new hire’s perspective on the team in that first 90 days. (52)
- Communicating with Your Team (52)
- Have Regular 1-1s (52)
- Scheduling 1-1s (53)
- The default scheduling for 1-1s is weekly. (53)
- Adjusting 1-1s (53)
- Different 1-1 Styles (54)
- The To-Do List Meeting (54)
- One or both parties comes in with a list of objectives to cover, and the parties cover these objectives in order of importance. Updates are given, decisions are made or discussed, planning happens. (54)
- The Catch-up (55)
- My goal in a 1-1 is first to listen to anything my direct reports want to discuss. I want the meeting to be driven by them, and I want to give them space to bring up whatever they feel is important. (55)
- The Feedback Meeting (55)
- Sometimes your 1-1s will be devoted to informal feedback and coaching. (55)
- As much as possible, when someone does something that needs immediate corrective feedback (insulting a colleague, missing a critical meeting, using inappropriate language), don’t wait for the 1-1 to provide that feedback. (55)
- The Progress Report (56)
- When you get to the stage where you’re managing managers, a lot of your 1-1 meetings will be diving into details of projects they’re overseeing that you don’t have time to dig into on your own. When you are managing only a handful of individuals, the only time you should be using a 1-1 to do progress reporting is when you have someone who’s off on a side project that you’re not personally overseeing. (56)
- Getting to Know You (56)
- Whatever type of 1-1 you do, leave room to get to know the person reporting to you as a human being. (56)
- Mix It Up (56)
- For variety, you can do your 1-1s as walking meetings, or over coffee or lunch to get out of the office. Just remember that when you’re not taking notes you’ll probably forget some important things, so try not to rely on these for critical conversations. (56)
- One final piece of advice: try to keep notes in a shared document, with you the manager playing note taker. (56)
- Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator (57)
- The hardest thing about micromanagement is that there are times when you need to do it. (58)
- However, if micromanagement is your habit, if it’s your default approach toward leading your team, you’ll end up like poor Jane, accidentally undermining the very people you need to be growing and rewarding. (58)
- Autonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation. (58)
- On the other hand, delegation is not the same thing as abdication. When you’re delegating responsibility, you’re still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed. (58)
- Practical Advice for Delegating Effectively (59)
- Use the Team’s Goals to Understand Which Details You Should Dig Into (59)
- My philosophy is simple: if the team is making progress on its goals, the systems are stable, and the product manager is happy, I rarely dig into the details beyond a cursory overview. (59)
- When you are managing a team that doesn’t have a clear plan, use the details you’d want to monitor to help them create one. (59)
- Gather Information from the Systems Before Going to the People (59)
- The worst micromanagers are those who constantly ask for information they could easily get themselves. (59)
- Adjust Your Focus Depending on the Stage of Projects (59)
- Establish Standards for Code and Systems (60)
- Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Neutral to Positive Way (60)
- In the long run, if you don’t figure out how to let go of details, delegate, and trust your team, you’re likely to suffer personally. (61)
- If you’re already in this situation, try limiting the hours you’ll let yourself work in a week. (61)
- Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback (61)
- There are some steps you can take to be great at giving continuous feedback: (62)
- Know your people. (62)
- Observe your people. (62)
- Provide lightweight, regular feedback. (62)
- Bonus: Provide coaching. (63)
- Coaching-based continuous feedback means going beyond a simple “good job” to really engage with the details and form a partnership with your direct report where the two of you are working together to help her grow. (63)
- Save your valuable coaching time for those who are receptive to it. (63)
- Performance Reviews (63)
- The 360 model is a performance review that includes feedback from, in addition to a person’s manager, his teammates, anyone who reports to him, and coworkers he regularly interacts with, as well as a self-review. (63)
- Performance reviews reward the time spent by providing a valuable chance to synthesize a bunch of information about a person. (64)
- Writing and Delivering a Performance Review (64)
- Give yourself enough time, and start early (64)
- Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months (65)
- Use concrete examples, and excerpts from peer reviews (65)
- Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths (65)
- When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused (65)
- Especially in the case of scattershot feedback, make sure that the feedback you’re seeing makes sense before you deliver it. (66)
- If the feedback seems valuable for the person to hear, share it, but don’t just blindly report all grudges. (66)
- What about the case where you have very little meaningful feedback for improvement? This indicates that the person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work. (66)
- Avoid big surprises (66)
- Schedule enough time to discuss the review (67)
- Cultivating Careers (68)
- Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers (70)
- Whatever the procedure is at your company, the process of coaching someone out should begin long before any performance improvement document is filed with HR, and long before the actual act of firing. (71)
- One of the basic rules of management is the rule of no surprises, particularly negative ones. (71)
- Feedback, positive or negative, should be a conversation. (71)
- A final warning: don’t put anyone on a plan whom you wouldn’t be happy to lose. (72)

## Chapter 5. Managing a Team (74)
- As much as you may want to believe that management is a natural progression of the skills you develop as a senior engineer, it’s really a whole new set of skills and challenges. (75)
- Staying Technical (77)
- As you progress in your career, even though you may stop writing code, your job will require that you guide technical decision making. (77)
- Why bother writing any code if all you’re doing is small stuff? The answer is that you need to stay enough in the code to see where the bottlenecks and process problems are. (78)
- It’s far easier to identify technical debt and prioritize dealing with it when you’ve slogged through the code yourself. (78)
- Additionally, as the manager of a single team, you’ll be called upon to help guide what is possible and impossible to do in your systems. (78)
- Debugging Dysfunctional Teams: The Basics (79)
- Not Shipping (79)
- Humans, by and large, feel good when they set small goals and meet them regularly. (79)
- Sometimes, teams aren’t shipping because the tools and processes they’ve been using make it hard to get work done quickly. (79)
- People Drama (80)
- Sometimes we let ourselves hang onto that brilliant asshole for too long. (80)
- You have to be brave and nip people drama in the bud quickly. (80)
- The negative person is easier to deal with than the brilliant jerk. (80)
- Unhappiness Due to Overwork (80)
- My advice is to dedicate 20% of your time in every planning session to system sustainability work (“sustainability” instead of the more common “technical debt”). (80)
- In a case where overwork is due to a pressing, time-critical release, remember two things. (81)
- First, you should be playing cheerleader. (81)
- Second, do everything you can to learn from this crunch period and avoid it the next time. (81)
- Collaboration Problems (81)
- There’s no quick fix here, but showing a willingness to improve collaboration goes a long way. (81)
- If your team isn’t working well together, look into creating some opportunities for them to hang out without it being all about work. (81)
- Throughout all of this change, your goal is to show the team that you’re committed to helping them succeed. (82)
- The Shield (83)
- Or, to put it another way, helping them understand the key important goals and focusing them on those goals is important. However, it’s unrealistic to expect that you can or should shield your team from everything. (83)
- The extreme shielders think they can best focus and motivate their teams by giving clear goals. But humans usually need some sort of context into why these goals have been set, and thereby into what problems they’re working to solve. (83)
- Another error that the shield sometimes makes is denying that any drama exists in the outside world. (84)
- You are not their parent. Your team is made up of adults who need to be treated with appropriate respect. (84)
- How to Drive Good Decisions (84)
- The nature of leadership is that, while you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you’ll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out. (84)
- Create a Data-Driven Team Culture (84)
- For example, give that person data about team productivity (such as the time it takes to complete features) or data about quality measures (like how much time is spent dealing with outages, or the number of bugs found in QA or after releases). (84)
- These efficiency and technical data points can be used to evaluate decisions on both product features and technical changes. (85)
- Flex Your Own Product Muscles (85)
- Strong leadership cares about cultivating success and having a team that delivers successful projects, which means honing your understanding of what is important to your customer. (85)
- Look into the Future (85)
- Start asking the product team questions about what the future might look like, and spend some time keeping up with technological developments that might change the way you think about the software you’re writing or the way you’re operating it. (85)
- Review the Outcome of Your Decisions and Projects (85)
- Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day (85)
- Good Manager, Bad Manager: Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer (86)
- Creating a safe environment for disagreement to work itself out is far better than pretending that all disagreement does not exist. (87)
- The Dos and Don’ts of Managing Conflict (87)
- Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. (87)
- Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions. (87)
- Don’t turn a blind eye to simmering issues. (87)
- Do address issues without courting drama. (88)
- Don’t take it out on other teams. (88)
- Do remember to be kind. (88)
- Don’t be afraid. (89)
- Some fear is natural, and being sensitive to the outcomes of conflict is a wise habit. (89)
- Do get curious. (89)
- Be thoughtful about your behavior, and it’s unlikely that you’ll seek out unnecessary conflict. (89)
- Challenging Situations: Team Cohesion Destroyers (89)
- Most gelled teams have a sense of camaraderie that makes them joke together, get coffee, share lunch, and feel friendly toward one another. (90)
- The real goal here is psychological safety — that is, a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. (90)
- Beyond you personally cultivating relatedness, you want your teams to have their own relatedness among themselves. (90)
- The Brilliant Jerk (90)
- The best way to avoid brilliant jerk syndrome is to simply not hire one. (91)
- The best thing you can do for your team, in the context of having a brilliant jerk, is to simply and openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior. (91)
- When a person is behaving badly in a way that is having a visible impact on the team, and a way you don’t want your culture to mimic, you need to say something in the moment to make the standard clear. (91)
- If you just think the person is undermining you personally, discuss it in private. (91)
- Your first goal is to protect your team as a whole, the second is to protect each individual on the team, and your last priority is protecting yourself. (91)
- The Noncommunicator (91)
- Whatever the cause, this person disrupts team cohesion because he isn’t being collaborative with the rest of his teammates; he doesn’t feel safe sharing his work in progress, and his fear often sets an example for the rest of the team. (92)
- possible, address the root cause of the hiding. (92)
- The Employee Who Lacks Respect (92)
- Ask her if she wants to be working on your team. If she says she does, lay out what you expect, clearly and calmly. If she says she doesn’t, start the process to move her to another team, or help her leave the company. (92)
- Advanced Project Management (93)
- Project Management Rules of Thumb (93)
- None of this is a replacement for agile project management (93)
- However, you are responsible for the larger picture — the accomplishments that are measured in months instead of weeks — and this is where you have to start exerting some higher-level planning. (93)
- You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter (94)
- Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board (94)
- As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no (94)
- Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks (95)
- Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate (95)

## Chapter 6. Managing Multiple Teams (98)
- We’re going to talk about managing multiple teams before we talk about managing managers, because while those things are related, they don’t necessarily coincide. (99)
- The engineering director is primarily concerned with ensuring smooth execution of complex deliverables. (100)
- Due to their breadth of exposure to both technology and the business drivers, directors are responsible for guiding the goal-setting process for all of the teams in their organization, helping these teams articulate goals that support both business initiatives and technology and organizational quality. (101)
- Fortunately for us, there are ways to stay hands-on that don’t require writing a lot of production code. (101)
- The risk of going hands-off is greatly amplified if you don’t spend enough time coding before moving into this role to get yourself deeply, fluently comfortable with at least one programming language. (101)
- Finally, even if you don’t intend to write much code, I strongly advise you to keep at least a solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings or other obligations, and try to use this time at least partially on some creative pursuit. (102)
- Managing Your Time: What’s Important, Anyway? (103)
- Managing your time comes down to one important thing: understanding the difference between importance and urgency. (103)
- Email is probably the worst vehicle for conveying urgent, time-sensitive information. It feels urgent, but it isn’t urgent. This is why so many precise time-management tips encourage reading and responding to email at specific times of the day. (104)
- There are many things that feel urgent that aren’t. The whole of the internet, for example. (104)
- It’s likely that you’re spending a lot of your time on things that are urgent but only slightly important, and sacrificing things that are important but not urgent. (104)
- One example of an important but not urgent task is actually preparing for meetings so that you can guide them in a healthy way. (104)
- One of the major changes at this level compared to the previous level is that your boss will expect you to be mature enough to manage yourself and your teams independently. (105)
- During meetings, look around the room at your team and notice their engagement. If half of them are falling asleep, staring off into space, on their phones or laptops ignoring the proceedings, or otherwise disengaged, the meeting is wasting their time. (105)
- Back to matters important but not urgent. Thinking about the future is high on this list. (105)
- Decisions and Delegation (107)
- The best way to describe the feeling of management from here on out is plate spinning. (107)
- Your plates are the people and projects you’re overseeing, and your job is to figure out how much attention each one needs at what time. (107)
- I recommended in the last section that you think carefully about dropping out of meetings, and part of the reason is that those meetings are where you learn what healthy and unhealthy dynamics look like. (107)
- Delegation is the primary way you claw yourself out of the feeling of having too many plates spinning at once. (108)
- The degree of complexity and the frequency of the task can act as guides to determining whether and how you should delegate. (108)
- Delegate Simple and Frequent Tasks (108)
- Handle Simple and Infrequent Tasks Yourself (108)
- Use Complex and Infrequent Tasks as Training Opportunities for Rising Leaders (108)
- Delegate Complex and Frequent Tasks to Develop Your Team (109)
- Your goal is to make your teams capable of operating at a high level without much input from you, and that means they’ll need individuals who can take over these complex tasks and run them without you around. (109)
- Challenging Situations: Strategies for Saying No (111)
- Each of these nos is hard, in its own way, and a strong manager must develop effective strategies for saying no. Here are a few that I have identified. (111)
- “Yes, and” (111)
- Create Policies (111)
- When it comes to your team, you want to help them understand what it takes to get to “yes.” (111)
- When you start repeating yourself, you have the basis for a reasonable policy. (112)
- “Help Me Say Yes” (112)
- Often, this line of questioning helps people come to the realization themselves that their plan isn’t a good idea, but sometimes they’ll surprise you with their line of thinking. Either way, curious interrogation of ideas can help you say no and teach at the same time. (112)
- Appeal to Budget (112)
- Work as a Team (112)
- Speaking of your peers, there will be times when you and your peers (particularly across functions — i.e., your product or business peers) will need to act together to say no. (112)
- Don’t Prevaricate (113)
- When you know that you need to say no, it’s better to say it quickly than to delay and drag out the process. (113)
- Technical Elements Beyond Code (114)
- You’re going to turn your technical focus now to observing and improving the systems of work that your developers are operating within. (114)
- The popular management book First, Break All the Rules2 discusses several questions you can answer to help predict team productivity and satisfaction. Among them are: Do I know what is expected of me at work? Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day? (114)
- Measuring the Health of Your Development Team (115)
- Frequency of Releases (115)
- In this modern era, frequency of code change is one of the leading indicators of a healthy engineering team. (115)
- You’re responsible for leading the effort here, even if you don’t do the work. Push for time away from the product roadmap to support increasing engineering productivity, and set goals for the team that inspire them to move faster. (116)
- Frequency of Code Check-ins (117)
- Frequency of Incidents (117)
- Good Manager, Bad Manager: Us Versus Them, Team Player (118)
- It can be hard for new managers to create a shared team identity. (118)
- Many of them default to an identity built around the specifics of their job function or technology. They unite the team by emphasizing how this identity is special as compared to other teams. (118)
- Rallying a team in this way is a shallow binding that is vulnerable to many dysfunctions: (119)
- Fragile to the loss of the leader. (119)
- Resistant to outside ideas. (119)
- Empire building. (119)
- Inflexibility. (119)
- As a manager, be careful about focusing on your teams to the exclusion of the wider group. (119)
- Before you try to change everything to fit your vision, take the time to understand the company’s strengths and culture, and think about how you’re going to create a team that works well with this culture, not against it. (119)
- Durable teams are built on a shared purpose that comes from the company itself, and they align themselves with the company’s values (see “Applying Core Values” in Chapter 9 for more on this topic). (120)
- By creating a strong and enduring alignment between the team, its individuals, and the overall company, this purpose-based binding makes teams: (120)
- Resilient to loss of individuals. (120)
- Driven to find better ways to achieve their purpose. (120)
- They care less about the source of an idea than its merit in achieving their goals. (120)
- First-team focused. (120)
- Open to changes that serve their purpose. (120)
- The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience (121)
- Impatience and laziness, applied to process, are the key elements to focus. (121)
- As you grow more into leadership positions, people will look to you for behavioral guidance. (121)
- What you want to teach them is how to focus. (121)
- I encourage you to practice modeling, right now: figuring out what’s important, and going home. (121)
- I can’t stand watching people waste their energy approaching problems with brute force and spending time rather than thought. (121)
- constantly ask yourself the same questions you ask your team: Can I do this faster? Do I need to be doing this at all? What value am I providing with this work? (122)

## Chapter 7. Managing Managers (124)
- The job expectations for managing managers are not that different from the expectations of managing multiple teams. (125)
- The difference is one of magnitude. (125)
- This is a tough growth point. (125)
- In order to do this well, you’ll need to practice honing your instincts, and this practice will require you to follow through on things that you’re not sure are actually important, but you just sense are off. (125)
- You haven’t yet built up the discipline or instincts to let yourself intuitively sense where and when to dive in deep, so you need to do so more frequently, even when things seem to be going well. (126)
- Here, you need to follow up on all the little things until you figure out what you don’t need to follow up on. (126)
- This position is the first level in a much bigger game, the entrée into senior leadership and upper management, and that will require a large number of new skills. (126)
- One thing that managers have to keep in mind is that part of their job is to ferret out problems proactively. (127)
- Skip-Level Meetings (128)
- One form of skip-level meeting is a short 1-1 meeting, held perhaps once a quarter, between the head of an organization and each person in that organization. (128)
- These meetings are most successful when you provide prompts about potential topics, and remind the person that the meeting is largely for his or her benefit. (128)
- If you have a larger organization, or are impatient with the idea of adding more unstructured 1-1s to your schedule, there are other ways to get skip-level time. I used to hold skip-level lunches with whole teams, where I would buy lunch for the group and we would talk about whatever was going on. (129)
- Of course, people act differently in group scenarios, and when you are the Big Boss they may feel uncomfortable complaining in front of others about problems they’re having with their manager, even when this person isn’t in the room. (129)
- At this level, you’re constantly making tradeoffs between investing in expensive engagements, such as 1-1s, that can provide deep value but cost you in time and energy, or casual engagements that are more efficient in terms of your time but provide less detailed information. (130)
- Don’t underestimate this process, even in the case where you know the skip-level reports well. There’s (130)
- Manager Accountability (131)
- they should make your life easier. Your managers should allow you to spend more time on the bigger picture, and less time on the details of any one team. This is why they’re around. (131)
- Well, that sounds good, except for one little thing: sometimes managers make your life easier by hiding problems and telling you what you want to hear, until months later you see things falling apart and wonder where you went wrong. So you can’t just expect that they’ll magically make things better — you have to hold them accountable. (131)
- The answer to all of these questions is yes. Yes, despite the mitigating circumstances in each case, the manager ultimately needs to take responsibility for pulling the team out of these situations and getting them moving forward, because the manager is accountable for the health and productivity of the team. (132)
- This is what making your job easier looks like — not hiding information, but bringing you clear problems before they turn into raging fires. (132)
- Managers need coaching and guidance in the same way that individual contributors need coaching and guidance. (133)
- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The People Pleaser (133)
- Managing New Managers (136)
- Spending quality time with your new managers is important, and you should expect this to be an up-front cost that pays long-term dividends for your organization. (136)
- In the face of a new and daunting job, some people just won’t do it. (137)
- One common sign of a struggling first-time manager is overwork. (137)
- Overwork is also often a sign of another new manager danger: the person who thinks she’s now in control, the taskmaster of the team, responsible for making all of the decisions. (137)
- The new manager you’re training should be ultimately making your job easier by more than just taking the responsibility of doing a bunch of 1-1 meetings off your shoulders. She also needs to be on top of the team’s performance and delivery, guiding them to focus on their goals and deliver results. (137)
- First-time managers are tricky because if they truly don’t have the willingness to learn and aptitude to become solid managers, they’re a big problem. (138)
- Beyond the coaching that you’ll need to provide your first-time managers, I recommend seeking out additional external training. (138)
- Managing Experienced Managers (138)
- Management tends to be a very culture-specific task in a company. (139)
- So, the first challenge is making sure this person fits in with the culture of your team. (139)
- If you’re building a dynamic, product-centric engineering team, you need managers who understand how to work with teams who ship software frequently, who are comfortable with modern development process best practices, and who can inspire creative product-centric engineers. These skills are so much more important than industry-specific knowledge. (139)
- You’re responsible for cultivating the culture of your organization, and especially when you’ve been at the company for a longer period of time, you should ensure that all of your managers respect and nurture the type of culture that you think is best for the team. (140)
- a lot of the coaching you provide will be less about the nuts and bolts of management and more about how he can have a larger impact on strategy and direction setting for his area. (140)
- Hiring Managers (140)
- Hiring for managers is a multipart exercise, and those parts are actually very similar to those of a good engineering interview process. First, make sure that the person has the skills you need. Second, make sure that she’s a culture match for your organization. (140)
- The biggest difference between a management interview and an engineering interview is that managers can, theoretically, bullshit you more easily. (141)
- The skills of a manager, as we have discussed at length, are pretty much entirely based around communication. (141)
- Any manager you hire should role-play a few 1-1s as part of the interview process. (141)
- One of the best ways to do this is by asking the people who would report to the new manager to interview her by asking her to help with problems they have right now, or have had in the recent past. (141)
- You can take it a step further and actually role-play other types of difficult situations, like dealing with an employee who is underperforming, or delivering a negative performance review. (141)
- Importantly, a manager must also be able to debug teams. (141)
- Ask her about her management philosophy. (141)
- You want to make sure that you get enough of a sense of a candidate’s technical skills that she’ll be able to establish credibility to the team she’ll be managing. (142)
- Design and architecture questions based on the types of systems she’s built or managed are a good approach. (142)
- You might also have her mediate a technical debate between engineers who disagree on the solution to a problem. (142)
- Culture fit is so important in managers because they shape their teams to their culture, and they hire new people based on their cultural ideas. (143)
- In his book High Output Management,1 Andy Grove talks about cultural values as one of the ways that people make decisions inside of highly complex, uncertain, or ambiguous circumstances where they value the group interest above their own. (143)
- His observation is that most new hires act in self-interest until they get to know their colleagues, and then they move into group interest. So, if you start them in a highly complex or uncertain job, they tend to fail unless they quickly settle into the cultural norms and use cultural values to align their decision making. (143)
- When you hire a manager over a team doing things that you don’t deeply understand, it’s easy for that manager to go the wrong way for a very long time before you realize what’s happening. (144)
- An interesting way to combat this problem is to use the same mindset that I advised when we talked about mentorship — namely, being very curious. (144)
- Make it clear to the person that your goal is to understand what she does so that you’re capable of appreciating it better. (144)
- Debugging Dysfunctional Organizations (145)
- I believe that the best engineering managers are often great debuggers. (145)
- A great debugger is relentless in his pursuit of the “why” for a bug. (145)
- Managing teams is a series of complex black boxes interacting with other complex black boxes. These black boxes have inputs and outputs that can be observed, but when the outputs aren’t as expected, figuring out why requires trying to open them up and see what’s going on inside. (145)
- How do you figure this out? (146)
- Have a Hypothesis (146)
- Check the Data (146)
- Observe the Team (146)
- Boring meetings are a sign. (147)
- Be aware, though, that while teams can be black boxes, they share a characteristic of another famous box — the one containing Schrödinger’s cat. (147)
- The point of Schrödinger’s experiment was to show that the act of observing changes the outcome, or rather, causes an outcome to happen. (147)
- Ask Questions (147)
- Ask the team what their goals are. (147)
- Check the Team Dynamics (148)
- Jump In to Help (148)
- Be Curious (148)
- Without the drive to understand why, we rely on charm and luck to see us through our management careers and to make our hiring and firing decisions. (148)
- Setting Expectations and Delivering on Schedule (149)
- Therefore, you must always be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don’t ask, especially if you believe that the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks. (149)
- Not every project necessarily has requirements that change frequently, and it’s possible to do up-front work to drastically reduce the unknowns that make software estimation difficult. (149)
- We can’t predict the future perfectly, but teaching our teams how to hone their instincts about complexity and opportunity is a worthy goal. (150)
- Another core element of agile software development is the emphasis on learning from the past. (150)
- Finally, don’t be afraid to work with your managers, tech leads, and the business to cut scope toward the ends of projects in order to make important deadlines. (150)
- Be smart about what you’re willing to give on. If you give only on matters of technical quality, you’ll just slow down the team after the project is launched, so be sure to look at product features in addition to technical nice-to-haves. (150)
- Challenging Situations: Roadmap Uncertainty (151)
- You may have very little ability to push back on the changes to strategy coming from above, and even when you’ve promised your team that certain projects will happen, you sometimes have to pull back on that promise because of unexpected changes. (151)
- Coming into play here is a secondary challenge: how do you make the time for your team to deal with technical debt and other engineering-focused projects when there doesn’t seem to be a clear process for prioritizing that work? (151)
- Strategies for Handling Roadmap Uncertainty (151)
- Be realistic about the likelihood of changing plans given the size and stage of the company you work for. (151)
- Think about how to break down big projects into a series of smaller deliverables so that you can achieve some of the results, even if you don’t necessarily complete the grand vision. (151)
- Don’t overpromise a future of technical projects. (152)
- Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” (152)
- Understand how important various engineering projects really are. (152)
- How big is that project? (152)
- How important is it? (152)
- Can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks? (152)
- What would successful completion of the project mean for the team? (152)
- The value of these questions is that you start to treat big technical projects the same way as product initiatives. (152)
- As a manager, the best thing you can do is help people feel capable of tying up loose ends, stabilizing the current in-flight projects, and easing into their new work in a controlled fashion. This is an area where you can and should push back. (153)
- Staying Technically Relevant (153)
- Oversee Technical Investment (154)
- Ask Informed Questions (154)
- Analyze and Explain Engineering and Business Tradeoffs (154)
- Make Specific Requests (154)
- By knowing enough about the progress of your teams, the projects, and bottlenecks, you can filter out technically infeasible ideas and map new initiatives onto ongoing projects. These specific requests should be used to keep the teams productive and balance technical risks with organizational goals. (154)
- Managers who don’t stay technical enough sometimes find themselves in the bad habit of acting as a go-between for senior management and their teams. Instead of filtering requests, they relay them to the team and then relay the team’s response back up to management. This is not a value-add role. (155)
- Use Your Experience as a Gut Check (155)
- Given your level of technical responsibility, how should you invest your time in order to stay technically relevant? (155)
- Read the code. Occasionally taking the time to read some of the code in your systems can help remind you what it looks like. (155)
- Pick an unknown area, and ask an engineer to explain it to you. (155)
- Attend postmortems. (156)
- Keep up with industry trends in software development processes. (156)
- Foster a network of technical people outside of your company. (156)
- Never stop learning. (156)
- Assessing Your Own Experience (156)

## Chapter 8. The Big Leagues (159)
- As technical senior managers, we bring special skills to an organization. In particular, we bring a willingness to embrace and drive change as needed. (159)
- It’s not enough to be a change agent; we have to create an organization that can successfully follow through on the changes we want to push. (159)
- Your first job is to be a leader. The company looks to you for guidance on what to do, where to go, how to act, how to think, and what to value. (159)
- You’re capable of making hard decisions without perfect information and willing to face the consequences of those decisions. (160)
- You’re capable of understanding the current landscape of your business, as well as seeing into its many potential futures. (160)
- You understand organizational structure and how it impacts the work of teams. (160)
- You can play politics in a productive way, in order to move the organization and the business forward. (160)
- You work well with your peers outside of engineering and seek out their perspectives in addressing issues with a wide scope. (160)
- You understand how to disagree with a decision and commit to deliver on it even though you disagree. (160)
- You know how to hold individuals and organizations accountable for their output. (160)
- In his book High Output Management,1 Andy Grove breaks down management tasks into four general categories: (160)
- Information gathering or information sharing (160)
- Nudging Reminding people of their commitments by asking questions instead of giving orders. (160)
- Decision making (161)
- Role modeling (161)
- Models for Thinking About Tech Senior Leadership (162)
- Instead of trying to cover all of the variants of roles in senior leadership, I’m going to start by explaining some of the most common roles that senior management can play, and how those roles can fit together. (162)
- Research and development (R&D) (162)
- This role might own technology strategy, or it might be purely a role for finding new ideas. (162)
- Technology strategy/visionary (162)
- Organization The organizational manager guides the structure and people in the organization. (163)
- Execution Usually paired with “Organization,” this person makes sure things actually get done. He helps align roadmaps, plan work, and coordinate large efforts. (163)
- Face of technology, external (163)
- Infrastructure and technical operations manager (163)
- Business executive This is someone whose first focus is the business itself. (163)
- The CTO role in particular changes its focus wildly depending on the company, although most strong CTOs have a strategic function under their command, whether it’s business-focused, technology strategy, or both. (164)
- What’s a VP of Engineering? (164)
- The VP of Engineering role varies just as much as the CTO role does, based on the needs of the organization. (164)
- The VP is usually at the top of the management career ladder for engineers. (164)
- As companies grow, it’s common for the VP-level role to change from an organizationally focused job to a business strategy position. (164)
- Their roles become more strategy-focused over time, while the organizational management duties fall more to their deputies at the director or senior director level. (164)
- Let’s put the complexities of large companies aside and focus on the VP of Engineering that you’ll most likely encounter in a company that has a single person in this role. (164)
- As the person in charge of the day-to-day operations of the team, a good VP of Engineering has a solid handle on processes and details. (165)
- While some CTOs will do this, if there’s both a CTO and a VP of Engineering, the VP is usually the one pushing the execution of ideas, while the CTO focuses on larger strategy and the position of technology within the company. (165)
- The VP of Engineering also handles a significant amount of management responsibility. (165)
- She should be a coach to the engineering management team, identifying and improving existing talent and working with HR to provide training and development resources for those leaders. (165)
- She must be able to gain people’s trust and show wisdom in management and leadership. (165)
- The VP of Engineering also needs to have some stake in organizational strategy, and often she owns this strategy entirely. (165)
- What’s a CTO? (166)
- the CTO should be the strategic technical executive the company needs in its current stage of evolution. (166)
- “strategic”? The CTO thinks about the long term, and helps to plan the future of the business and the elements that make that possible. (166)
- “executive”? The CTO takes that strategic thinking and helps to make it real and operational by breaking down the problem and directing people to execute against it. (167)
- First and foremost, a CTO must care about and understand the business, and be able to shape business strategy through the lens of technology. He is an executive first, a technologist second. (167)
- No matter what, the CTO must understand where the biggest technical opportunities and risks for the business are and focus on capitalizing on them. (167)
- Strong CTOs also have significant management responsibility and influence. (167)
- It’s incredibly difficult to maintain influence and effectiveness as an executive with no reporting power. (167)
- If you’re a leader with no power over business strategy and no ability to allocate people to important tasks, you’re at best at the mercy of your influence with other executives and managers, and at worst a figurehead. You can’t give up the responsibility of management without giving up the power that comes with it. (168)
- My advice for aspiring CTOs is to remember that it’s a business strategy job first and foremost. It’s also a management job. (168)
- Changing Priorities (169)
- Do you know what the top priority is? Do your teams know what it is? Do the developers on those teams know what it is? (170)
- Sometimes the answer to this question is simply a matter of communication. (170)
- Saying something is top priority is one thing, but making the actual tradeoffs on the schedule to get people moving on it is completely different. (170)
- We forget that the people above us or in different organizations don’t have the same detailed understanding of what our teams are currently doing, and why. (170)
- However, when you’re taken to task for not focusing on the right priority, it’s a sign that you and the CEO have a misaligned understanding of reality, and you need to get on the same page. (170)
- The more senior the management and leadership position you take in a company, the more the job becomes making sure that the organization moves in the direction it needs to move in, and that includes changing direction when needed. (171)
- Finally, never underestimate how many times and how many ways something needs to be said before it sinks in. (171)
- You’ll also need to repeat information when you’re communicating up. When you want your boss to act on something, expect that you’ll need to tell him the same thing three times before he actually listens. (171)
- Setting the Strategy (172)
- When I talk about senior leadership, I emphasize strategy as a critical element. (172)
- what does setting technology strategy look like? (172)
- Do a Lot of Research (172)
- Combine Your Research and Your Ideas (173)
- Armed with my conclusions about the existing systems, teams, and bottlenecks, and having imagined the places where we could make things more efficient, expand features, or improve the business, I used the data to come up with a rough idea for a possible future. (173)
- Draft a Strategy (173)
- Once I had that data mapped, I could plan out actionable ideas to improve operational efficiency, expand features, and grow the business. (173)
- Consider Your Board’s Communication Style (173)
- If you’re in a product-focused business, this is the heart of your technology strategy. It’s not about actually deciding the product’s direction, but about enabling the larger roadmap to play out successfully. (174)
- After I clarified this architecture for myself, leading became in many ways much easier. (174)
- Challenging Situations: Delivering Bad News (174)
- Don’t blast an impersonal message to a large group. (175)
- Do talk to individuals as much as possible. (175)
- Don’t force yourself to deliver a message you can’t stand behind. (175)
- Do be honest about the likely outcomes. (176)
- Do think about how you would like to be told. (176)
- Ask the CTO: I Have a Nontechnical Boss (176)
- Don’t hide information behind jargon, and be careful with details. (176)
- Expect that you will need to run your 1-1s with your new boss, so come prepared with a list of topics. (177)
- Try to bring solutions, not problems to be solved. (177)
- Ask for advice. (177)
- Don’t be afraid to repeat yourself. (177)
- Be supportive. (177)
- Actively look for coaching and skill development in other places. (178)
- Senior Peers in Other Functions (178)
- Senior leaders, more than any other group in a company, must actively practice first-team focus (178)
- They are dedicated first and foremost to the business and its success, and secondly to the success of their departments as a way of contributing to the overall business success. (178)
- To start with, you let them own their areas, and they let you own yours. (178)
- Of course, you’ll disagree with your peers. The place for this disagreement is either one-on-one or in your leadership team meetings. (179)
- In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Lencioni notes that absence of trust is a fundamental dysfunction. In this case, what’s missing is the trust that your peers are actively trying to do their best for the organization, that they are not trying to manipulate situations, undermine you, or otherwise get their own way. (179)
- The final element of this first-team trust and respect is the cone of silence. Disagreements that happen in the context of the leadership team don’t exist to the wider team. (180)
- The Echo (180)
- You’re no longer one of the team. (180)
- If you shift your mindset successfully, you will probably start to detach socially a little bit from the overall organization. (180)
- Socializing heavily with your team outside of working hours is a thing of the past. (180)
- First, if you don’t detach, you’re likely to be accused of playing favorites. (180)
- Second, you need to detach because you need to learn how to lead effectively, and leading effectively requires people to take your words seriously. (180)
- Detaching also means being thoughtful about where you spend your time. As the senior leader, you’ll often suck all of the oxygen out of a room. Your mere presence will change the tone and structure of meetings you attend. (181)
- They may not refer to you by name, but as you choose which behaviors to model in front of the team, they will learn those behaviors and copy them. (181)
- You’re going to be part of hard decisions that will impact the whole business, and these decisions may cause you a great deal of stress. It won’t be appropriate to discuss these decisions with other people at the company. (181)
- As their leader, you can easily undermine their confidence by sharing worries that they can’t do anything to mitigate. (181)
- You may not be “one of the team,” but that doesn’t mean you should stop caring about the team as individuals. (181)
- Taking the time to get to know as many people as you can as humans — asking them about their families or hobbies or interests — is a good way to help them feel that they’re part of a group that cares about them. (181)
- As you grow more detached from the team, it can be easy to start to dehumanize people and treat them like cogs. (182)
- You’re a role model. What kind of leaders do you want to develop? What kind of legacy do you want to leave? (182)
- Ruling with Fear, Guiding with Trust (182)
- Correcting a Culture of Fear (183)
- Practice relatedness. One marker of the culture of fear is a tendency to treat people impersonally. (183)
- Apologize. When you screw up, apologize. Practice apologizing honestly and briefly. (184)
- Get curious. When you disagree with something, stop to ask why. (184)
- Learn how to hold people accountable without making them bad. (184)
- True North (185)
- A core role of senior leadership is sometimes overlooked. This role, played by the senior leader of a functional area (the CTO plays it for technology, the CFO plays it for finance, etc.), sets the baseline of what excellence looks like in this function. I call it “True North.” (185)
- True North represents the core principles that a person in a functional role must keep in mind as he does his job. (185)
- For a technical leader, True North means making sure that you’ve done your job getting things ready to go into production. (186)
- Technology leaders must help set the standard for True North in their organizations for different types of projects and exposures. (186)
- Another way to think of this is through the lens of risk analysis. (186)
- That being said, True North helps us understand that all these issues must be carefully considered when we put code into production. Just because these rules have exceptions doesn’t mean we forget that they exist. (186)
- I call this concept True North because it’s important to understand it as an underlying pull, as a guiding instinct that we as leaders have developed over time and strive to help our teams as a whole develop as well. When our teams develop this instinct, they can be trusted to independently follow these guidelines without much direction or nudging. (186)
- When you examine your role as a leader, looking at the ways that you set True North can help you understand your strengths and areas of ownership. (186)
- True North leaders rely on the wisdom they’ve developed over time to make fast decisions when they don’t have time to delve into all the details. (187)
- You no longer have a manager, you have a boss. (188)
- Do you have a professional coach, either provided by work or paid for yourself? This is a good investment even if your job doesn’t pay for it. (188)
- A peer group helps you see what the job looks like at other companies, and is a place where you can share experiences and get advice. (188)

## Chapter 9. Bootstrapping Culture (191)
- We don’t set up systems because structure and process have inherent value. We do it because we want to learn from our successes and our mistakes, and to share those successes and encode the lessons we learn from failures in a transparent way. This learning and sharing is how organizations become more stable and more scalable over time. (191)
- You’re going to be trying out structures and processes and learning from them, but it’s hard to learn if you don’t have a basic theory to test, and you don’t set out to prove or disprove hypotheses about that theory. (192)
- The most important thing for leaders to be willing to do in those early days — and leaders generally includes everyone in the company, not just the founders or executives — is to pick a strategy and run with it. (192)
- You don’t need to find the perfect solution; you need to find something that will get you through to the next milestone, whether that milestone is the next release, the next growth spurt, the next funding round, or the next hire. (192)
- Deciding not to decide right now is a popular option for new companies, because it really doesn’t matter at the scale of a few people. (193)
- One of the greatest writings about organizational politics is a piece called “The Tyranny of Structurelessness” by Jo Freeman. (193)
- Pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication. (193)
- Interestingly, Freeman describes a set of circumstances in which the unstructured group can, in fact, work: (193)
- It is task oriented. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that basically structures the group. (193)
- It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to insure that participants have a “common language” for interaction. (193)
- There is a high degree of communication. Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. (193)
- Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. (193)
- There is a low degree of skill specialization. Not everyone has to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one person. (194)
- The example of the structureless team also applies to technical decisions and processes. There is a reason that you often find a lot of spaghetti code in early startups. (194)
- It’s no surprise that we usually end up refactoring spaghetti code when we want to make it scalable, because refactoring usually involves identifying and explicitly drawing out structure in order to make the code base easier to read and work in. (194)
- That, in short, is the value of structure. Structure is how we scale, diversify, and take on more complex long-term tasks. (195)
- In the same way that strong technical systems designers are capable of identifying and shaping underlying system structures, strong leaders are capable of identifying and shaping underlying team structures and dynamics, and doing so in a way that supports the long-term goals of the team and equips the individuals to achieve their best. (195)
- Nothing is more ridiculous than a small team with a rigid hierarchy. (195)
- However, it’s more common in small companies to see structure come too late. (195)
- Assessing Your Role (195)
- Recognize the size of the vessel you’re steering. This will be determined by a combination of the number of people in the company, the age of the company, the size of the existing business infrastructure (software, processes, and the like), and risk tolerance: (195)
- In fact, there’s even a law that accounts for this, from John Gall’s book Systemantics:1 A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. (196)
- My advice to leaders is simple: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. The patterns you see are opportunities to evolve your structure, either by creating more or different structure or removing it. (197)
- What about examining success? Well, you can learn things from success, but it is often a poor teacher. (197)
- Analyzing situations and thinking about good takeaways takes time. If the value of your future time is less than the value of your current time, then you’re probably not going to worry too much about saving future time. (198)
- Creating Your Culture (198)
- Consciously guiding the culture of your team is part of a leader’s job, (199)
- Culture is the generally unspoken shared rules of a community. (199)
- People do make decisions using methods other than cultural values. (199)
- But in complex environments where the needs of the group must override the needs of the individual, cultural values are the glue that enables us to work as a team and make decisions when faced with uncertainty. (199)
- Not every person will fit in at every company. The sooner you realize this, the better. (199)
- Still, the amount of overlap between the traits you value most and the traits your company values most largely determines how easy the fit will be for you. (200)
- Applying Core Values (200)
- First, define your culture. If you have a set of company values, map those values onto your team. (200)
- Second, reinforce your culture by rewarding people for exhibiting its values in positive ways. (201)
- One of the most important uses of performance reviews is to evaluate the alignment between team members’ values and the company’s values, and therefore what values should be part of your performance review process. (201)
- Learn to spot people who have values conflicts with the company or team. (201)
- Using the core values to coach people in areas where they are misaligned can help you articulate what otherwise may feel like just ambiguous friction. (201)
- Finally, use this as part of your interview process. (202)
- The shortcuts you get by hiring friends are not usually the values you need to form a strong team. So, don’t be vague when discussing fit. Be specific. (202)
- and that is what makes this a powerful measure. Understand what your company’s values are, understand what your team’s values are, and think about what you personally value. (202)
- Write the values down if they aren’t already written, and try to be explicit. Use this explicit list to evaluate candidates, praise team members, and inform your performance review process. (202)
- Creating Cultural Policy (202)
- Creating cultural policy documents can be hard, because getting started on these documents from scratch is hard. Fortunately there are fewer and fewer documents that you need to start from scratch to create, as more people are sharing publicly their policies and processes for everything from career paths to pay scales to incident management. (202)
- What works for one company — a company that is creating a certain type of product or working in a certain industry — will not always translate well to another company, even if the companies have a lot of things in common. (204)
- Writing a Career Ladder (204)
- Solicit participation from your team. (204)
- Look for examples. (204)
- Be detailed. (205)
- Use both long-form descriptions and summaries. (205)
- Instead of just visualizing the level as a set of skills and attributes, the long-form ladder reads a bit like a performance review of a person operating well at each level. (205)
- Consider how the ladder relates to salary. (205)
- Provide many early opportunities for advancement. (205)
- Use narrow salary bands for early-career stages. (206)
- Lots of levels and narrow salary bands mean that you can promote people quickly and justify giving them raises while keeping your pay for all people at a certain level close to the same. (206)
- Use wide salary bands when and where you have fewer levels. (206)
- Consider your breakpoint levels. (206)
- It is common for companies to have certain levels that they consider “up or out.” (206)
- Recognize achievement. (207)
- I do encourage you to have at least some of your levels be keystone promotions, which are shared and celebrated. (207)
- Split management and technical tracks. (207)
- Consider making people management skills a mid-career requirement. (207)
- Encourage everyone to have some sort of management or mentorship experience before they are eligible to be promoted above the level of the track split. (207)
- Years of experience. (208)
- In my ladders, I distinguish the keystone levels by an expectation of maturity increases, and these tend to correspond with years of experience in the industry as well as, to a lesser extent, age. For example, take the case of staff engineer. (208)
- Don’t be afraid to evolve over time. (208)
- Cross-Functional Teams (208)
- When we put cross-functional teams together, we are acknowledging that the most important communication — the communication that we need to favor above all else — is that which leads to effective product development and iteration. (210)
- Structuring Cross-Functional Teams (210)
- I mean no value judgment here, but I encourage you to be aware of the product/business versus technology focus and apply it where it makes sense. (211)
- Developing Engineering Processes (211)
- Balancing the current size and risk tolerance of your team with the processes at hand is the essence of guiding good software development and operational guidelines. (212)
- you should not put a complicated process on any activity where you want people to move quickly and where you believe the risk for change in that activity is low or that the risks themselves are obvious to the whole team. (213)
- you need to be on the lookout for places where there is hidden risk, and draw those hidden risks out into the open. (213)
- Practical Advice: Depersonalize Decision Making (213)
- Code Review (213)
- Be clear about code review expectations. (213)
- Code review is largely a socialization exercise, so that multiple team members have seen and are aware of the changed code. (213)
- Use a linter for style issues. (214)
- Keep an eye on the review backlog. (214)
- The Outage Postmortem (214)
- In fact, instead of calling the process a postmortem, many have started calling it a “learning review” to indicate that its purpose is not determining cause of death but learning from the incident. (214)
- Resist the urge to point fingers and blame. (214)
- Look at the circumstances around the incident and understand the context of the events. (214)
- Be realistic about which takeaways are important and which are worth dropping. (215)
- Architecture Review (215)
- The goal of architecture review is to help socialize big changes to the appropriate group, and to make the risks for those changes clear. (215)
- Be specific about the kinds of changes that need architecture review. (215)
- People often want to have architecture review to prevent teams from designing new features poorly, but it is usually unrealistic to try to catch new feature design early enough in a small company, and it’s hard even in a large company. (215)
- The value of architecture review is in preparing for the review. (215)
- Choose the review board wisely. (216)
- You want the review board to include the people who will be most affected by the change, not just a static chosen group of gurus. (216)

## Chapter 10. Conclusion (216)
- The most important lesson I’ve learned is that you have to be able to manage yourself if you want to be good at managing others. The more time you spend understanding yourself, the way you react, the things that inspire you, and the things that drive you crazy, the better off you will be. (217)
- Great managers are masters of working through conflict. (217)
- Learning to recognize the voice of your ego is one of the benefits of meditation, and when I wrote the first draft of this book it included a series of meditations at each level. For me, having a meditation practice has been essential to developing self-management and self-awareness. (217)
- One other trick I use to get away from my ego is curiosity. I also have a daily habit of writing a page or two of free-flow thoughts every morning, to clear my mind and prepare for the day. (217)
- So I leave you with that thought. Look for the other side of the story. Think about the other perspectives at play. Investigate your emotional reactions, and observe when those reactions make it hard to see clearly what’s going on around you, what needs to be said. Apply that curiosity to people. Apply it to process. Apply it to technology, and strategy, and business. Ask questions, and be willing to have your notions proven wrong. (218)
