# How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers by Sönke Ahrens

- This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward. [2]
- To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. [3]

# 1 Everything You Need to Know [5]

- If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. [5]
- The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight. [6]
- This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing. [8]

## 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected [8]

- The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). [9]
- It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. [9]

## 1.2 The Slip-box [12]
- Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). [16]

## 1.3 The slip-box manual [18]

- Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. [18]
- Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. [18]
- In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought. [18]
- He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. [19]
- More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. [19]
- He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. [19]
- He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible. [19]
- Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. [20]
- By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. While other systems start with a preconceived order of topics, Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes. [20]
- The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. [20]

# 2 Everything You Need to Do [21]

- Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done. [22]
- Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. [22]

## 2.1 Writing a paper step by step [23]

1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. [23]
    - Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. [23]
2. Make literature notes. [24]
    - Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words. [24]
    - Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system. [24]
3. Make permanent notes. [24]
    - Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. [24]
    - The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. [24]
    - Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. [24]
4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by: [24]
    1. Filing each one behind one or more related notes [24]
    2. Adding links to related notes. [25]
    3. Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index. [25]
5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. [25]
    - Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will take you. Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight. Build upon what you have. [25]
6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide. [25]
    - Look for what is missing and what is redundant. Don’t wait until you have everything together. Rather, try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking to improve your ideas, arguments and their structure. [26]
7. Turn your notes into a rough draft. [26]
    - Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time. Detect holes in your argument, fill them or change your argument. [26]
8. Edit and proofread your manuscript. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder and turn to the next manuscript. [26]
    - A typical work day will contain many, if not all, of these steps: You read and take notes. You build connections within the slip-box, which in itself will spark new ideas. You write them down and add them to the discussion. You write on your paper, notice a hole in the argument and have another look in the file system for the missing link. You follow up on a footnote, go back to research and might add a fitting quote to one of your papers in the making. [27]
    - Most people follow different lines of thought at the same time. They might focus for a while on one idea, but then leave it alone for another while until they see how to proceed further. It is helpful then to be able to pick up on another idea now and go back to the earlier thought later. It is much more realistic to keep this flexibility and you don’t have to worry about starting all over. [27]

# 3 Everything You Need to Have [28]
- The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information. [29]
- That is pretty much it. To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter. [29]
- We need four tools:  [29]
   - Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do)
   - A reference management system (the best programs are free)
   - The slip-box (the best program is free)
   - An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free)
- You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. Whatever you use, it should not require any thoughts, attention or multiple steps to write it down. [30]
- They will be deleted or chucked soon anyway. They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture the thought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and check facts. [30]
- If you use other tools, make sure everything ends up in one place, a central inbox or something like that, where you can process it soon, ideally within a day. [30]
- The reference system has two purposes: To collect the references (duh) and the notes you take during your reading. I strongly recommend using a free program like Zotero, which allows you to make new entries via browser plugins or just by entering the ISBN or digital object identifier (DOI) number. [30]
- computers can only speed up a relatively minor part of the work anyway, like adding links and formatting references. They can’t speed up the main part of the work, which is thinking, reading and understanding. [31]
- Finally, the editor: If you use Zotero, I recommend using one of the editors it is compatible with [31]
- If you have pen and paper, an editor, your slip-box and reference system at hand, you are ready to go. [31]
- And it is indeed crucially important not only to know how it works or how to work with it, but also why it works. Only then will you be able to tweak it for your own needs. [32]

# The Four Underlying Principles [35]

# 5 Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters [35]

- For students, the need for writing mainly appears in the form of examination. In this understanding, the written work represents a preceded performance, namely learning, understanding and the ability to analyse other texts critically. By writing, students demonstrate what they have learned, show their ability to think critically and ability to develop ideas. [35]
- This book is based on another assumption: Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. [35]
- Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. [36]
- An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. [36]
- It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. [36]
- Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. [36]
- Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus. [37]
- And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). [38]

# 6 Simplicity Is Paramount [38]

- In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? [40]
- The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. [41]
- The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. [41]
- Even though the slip-box, being organised bottom-up, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on… [41]
- To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between… [41]
  1.  Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in… [41]
  2.  Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the… [41]
  3.  Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or… [42]
- A typical mistake is made by many diligent students who are adhering to the advice to keep a scientific journal. A friend of mine does not let any idea, interesting finding or quote he… [42]
- The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant… [42]
- The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to… [42]
- about and then collect everything that helps you to do that. The disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cut off… [42]
- But most importantly, without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself either to the length of a single project or the capacity… [43]
- The third typical mistake is, of course, to treat all notes… [43]
- What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with… [43]
- But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it should… [43]
- Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy… [43]
- Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. [44]
- These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven’t had the time to elaborate on yet. [44]
- Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. [44]
- A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. [44]
- The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with more care and details as they need to be self-explanatory. [44]
- Luhmann never underlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins. All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in a text on a separate piece of paper: [44]
- But before he stored them away, he would read what he noted down during the day, think about its relevance for his own lines of thought and write about it, filling his main slip-box with permanent notes. [45]
- The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. [45]

# 7  Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch [47]

- understanding, and that didn’t come out of thin air, either. Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle (Gadamer 2004). [48]
- We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas – and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally. [48]
- There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. [49]
- Instead of spending your time worrying about finding the right topic, you will spend your time actually working on your already existing interests and doing what is necessary to make informed decisions – reading, thinking and writing. By doing the work, you can trust that interesting questions will emerge. [51]

# 8  Let the Work Carry You Forward [51]

- A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on. [52]
- Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). [53]
- Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important. [53]
- Following a circular approach, on the other hand, allows you to implement many feedback loops, which give you the chance to improve your work while you are working on it. It is not just about increasing the number of opportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes we inevitably make. As the feedback loops are usually smaller than one big chunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier to embrace. [54]
- Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. [54]
- The same goes for writing permanent notes, which have another feedback loop built-in: Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. [55]
- Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed. [55]
- It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it so productive. [56]

# The Six Steps to Successful Writing [57]

# 9 Separate and Interlocking Tasks [57]

## 9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention [57]

## 9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea [58]

- Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time. [59]

## 9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention [61]

- If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text. [61]
- While proofreading requires more focused attention, finding the right words during writing requires much more floating attention. [62]
- Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requires a very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on the whole argument. It is important, though, to understand outlining not as the preparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need to return to throughout the writing process on a regular basis. We need a structure all the time, but as we work our way bottom-up, it is bound to change often. [62]
- Proofreading, formulating and outlining are also different from the task of combining and developing thoughts. [62]
- Reading, of course, is also different. Reading in itself can require very different kinds of attention, depending on the text. [63]
- Don’t make plans. Become an expert. [64]

## 9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner [64]

- Experts rely on embodied experience, which enables them to reach the state of virtuosity. An expert in academic writing has a feel for the process, an acquired intuition for which task will bring one closer to the finished manuscript and what is only a distraction. [65]
- To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn. [65]
- right in about a third of all the cases). Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, researchers on expertise, have a simple explanation: Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. [66]
- Experts, on the other hand, have internalised the necessary knowledge so they don’t have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices. They have acquired enough experience in various situations to be able to rely on their intuition to know what to do in which kind of situation. [66]
- Here, gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. [67]
- The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. [67]
- It allows you to become better by giving you the opportunity for deliberate practice. [67]
- Real experts, Flyvbjerg writes unambiguously, don’t make plans (Flyvbjerg 2001, 19). [67]

## 9.5 Get Closure [68]

- Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. [68]
- We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956). [68]
- But what we actually do when we use memo techniques is to bundle items together in a meaningful way and remember the bundles – up to about seven (Levin and Levin, 1990). [68]
- This is why it is so much easier to remember things we understand than things we don’t. [69]
- Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. [69]
- Every step is accompanied by questions like: How does this fact fit into my idea of …? How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn’t this argument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before? And above all: What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase our understanding, but facilitate learning as well. Once we make a meaningful connection to an idea or fact, it is difficult not to remember it when we think about what it is connected with. [69]
- the Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. [70]
- That’s right: The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. [70]
- The first step is to break down the amorphous task of “writing” into smaller pieces of different tasks that can be finished in one go. The second step is to make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries. As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time. [70]
- Possible subsequent tasks are open questions or connections to other notes, which we could elaborate on further or not. It also comes up in explicit reminders like “review this chapter and check for redundancies,” which belong into the project folder. Or the third option is the simple fact that something is still in our in-box waiting to be turned into a permanent note – a quick and not-yet–crossed-out note in our notebook, or literature notes not yet archived in our reference system. [70]
- Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. [71]
- Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way. [71]

## 9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions [71]

- the third limited resource is motivation or willpower. [71]
- The smartest way to deal with this kind of limitation is to cheat. Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doing the work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpower requires a technique, a ruse. [72]
- While content-related decisions have to be made (on what is more and what is less important in an article, on the connections between notes, the structure of a text, etc.), most organisational decisions can be made up front, once and for all, by deciding on one system. [73]
- Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the work exactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restore our attention: We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread. [73]

# 10 Read for Understanding [74]

## 10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand [74]

- When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory that isn’t ours or written in a language we wouldn’t use. This is why we have to translate them into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, the different context(s) within the slip-box. [75]
- I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.” [76]
- As literature notes are also a tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just jot down some keywords. [76]
- Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip. [76]
- Without a clear purpose for the notes, taking them will feel more like a chore than an important step within a bigger project. [77]
- Here, everything is about building up a critical mass of useful notes in the slip-box, which gives us a clear idea of how to read and how to take literature notes. [77]
- You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. [78]
- Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction. [78]
- They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better. [78]

## 10.2 Keep an Open Mind [79]

- Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support. [80]
- The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. [81]
- One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box. [81]
- And as soon we focus on the content of the slip-box, dis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box, while mere confirming data does not. [81]

## 10.3 Get the Gist [82]

- Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become. [82]
- But this dynamic can only start if we ourselves deliberately decide to take on the task of reading and being selective about it, relying on nothing other than our own judgement of what is important and what is not. [83]
- The better you become in doing this, the quicker you can jot down notes, which are still helpful. [84]

## 10.4 Learn to Read [85]

- Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture. Permanent notes, too, are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. [85]
- The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe. [85]
- Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. [86]
- If we don’t try to verify our understanding during our studies, we will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgeable while in reality staying as dumb as we were. [86]

## 10.5 Learn by Reading [87]

- Learning requires effort, because we have to think to understand and we need to actively retrieve old knowledge to convince our brains to connect it with new ideas as cues. [87]
- It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. [89]
- Elaboration means nothing other than really thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge. [89]
- Working with the slip-box, therefore, doesn’t mean storing information in there instead of in your head, i.e. not learning. On the contrary, it facilitates real, long-term learning. It just means not cramming isolated facts into your brain – something you probably wouldn’t want to do anyway. [90]
- There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on what they are best at. [90]

# 11 Take Smart Notes [90]

- What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text. [91]
- Without understanding information within its context, it is also impossible to go beyond it, to reframe it and to think about what it could mean for another question. [91]
- Lonka recommends what Luhmann recommends: Writing brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. And she also stresses that it is no less important to do something with these ideas – to think hard about how they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could inform questions that are not already the questions of the author of the respective text. [91]

## 11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time [92]

- Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest [93]
- In contrast to manuscript pages per day, a certain number of notes a day is a reasonable goal for academic writing. [93]
- You could therefore measure your daily productivity by the number of notes written. [94]

## 11.2 Think Outside the Brain [94]

- Taking literature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedback on our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read. [94]
- Writing here, too, is not copying, but translating (from one context and from one medium into another). [94]
- When we take permanent notes, it is much more a form of thinking within the medium of writing and in dialogue with the already existing notes within the slip-box than a protocol of preconceived ideas. [94]
- As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more into account than the information that is already available in our internal memory. [94]
- Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is not possible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53). [95]
- Philosophers, neuroscientists, educators and psychologists like to disagree in many different aspects on how the brain works. But they no longer disagree when it comes to the need for external scaffolding. Almost all agree nowadays that real thinking requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing. [95]
- A common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought. [96]
- But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest? [97]
- Just by writing down these questions and making possible connections explicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated. [98]
- By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else, we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other. [98]

## 11.3 Learn by not Trying [98]

- The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas. [99]
- We are very dependent on a subconscious mechanism that reliably inhibits almost every memory every moment except the very, very few that are truly helpful in a situation. [101]
- What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other. [103]
- The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well. [104]
- If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. [105]
- Feynman diagrams [105]
- Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to? [105]

## 11.4 Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box [106]

1. Add a note to the slip-box either behind the note you directly refer to or, if you do not follow up on a specific note, just behind the last note in the slip-box. [106]
2. Add links to other notes or links on other notes to your new note. [107]
3. Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index. [107]
4. Build a Latticework of Mental Models [107]

# 12 Develop Ideas [107]

- Ideally, new notes are written with explicit reference to already existing notes. [107]
- But a loose order of sequences allows freedom to change course when necessary and provides enough structure to build up complexity. [108]

## 12.1 Develop Topics [109]

- After adding a note to the slip-box, we need to make sure it can be found again. This is what the index is for. [109]
- Most notes will be found through other notes. [109]
- so all we need from the index are entry points. A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point. [109]
- As writers, we approach the question of keywords differently. We look at our slip-box for already existing lines of thought and think about the questions and problems already on our minds to which a new note might contribute. [110]
- By assigning the keyword alone, the note is already put into a specific context, which gives it a particular meaning and triggers context-specific questions [111]
- By assigning this keyword, you might stumble upon already existing notes on capital allocation, which either help to answer these questions or trigger new ones. [111]
- Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. [111]
- Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in the note. [111]
- Assigning keywords is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is a crucial part of the thinking process, which often leads to a deeper elaboration of the note itself and the connection to other notes. [112]

## 12.2 Make Smart Connections [112]

- Luhmann used four basic types of cross-references in his file-box (Schmidt 2013, 173f; Schmidt 2015, 165f). Only the first and last are relevant for the digital Zettelkasten, [112]
- The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you the overview of a topic. [112]
- degree that an overview is needed or at least becomes helpful. On a note like this, you can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic or question, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes (one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). [112]
- The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links. They have no function other than indicating a relevant connection between two individual notes. [114]
- It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not a chore, a kind of file-box maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript. [114]
- Instead of figuratively searching our internal memory, we literally go through the file-box and look for connections. [114]

## 12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate [115]

- If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a sobering discovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. [115]
- Sometimes, the confrontation with old notes helps to detect differences we wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. [115]
- Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions – important facilitators for insight. [116]
- Without external help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top of our heads. [117]

## 12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking [117]

- Just by working with the slip-box, we retrieve old ideas and facts on an irregular basis and connect them with other bits of information – very much how experts recommend we learn (Bjork 2011, 8; Kornell and Bjork 2008). [117]
- A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. [119]
- If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning. [119]
- We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval). [120]

## 12.5 Use the Slip-Box as a Creativity Machine [121]

- But intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge (cf. Ahrens 2014). [122]
- I would add the slip-box as such a space in which ideas can mingle freely, so they can give birth to new ones. [122]

## 12.6 Think Inside the Box [123]

- To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. [123]
- But we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, does not come naturally to us. [126]
- It is very good to know what has already proven to not work if we try to come up with new ideas that do work. [127]
- One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactual questions, like “what if?” (Markman, Lindberg, Kray and Galinsky, 2007). [127]
- Another seemingly banal tip relates to a distinguishing feature of extraordinary thinkers: Taking simple ideas seriously. [128]
- Making things more complicated than they are can be a way to avoid the underlying complexity of simple ideas. [128]
- Sometimes the breakthrough in a scientific process is the discovery of a simple principle behind a seemingly very complicated process. [129]
- Simple ideas can be tied together into consistent theories and build up enormous complexity. [129]
- By using the slip-box on a daily basis, we train these important intellectual skills deliberately: We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes. [129]

## 12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions [129]

- A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling. [130]
- Standardised is also the way we treat literature and our own thoughts: Instead of using different kinds of notes or techniques for different kinds of texts or ideas, the approach here is always the same, simple one. [130]
- A clear structure allows us to explore the internal possibilities of something. [131]
- The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not. [131]

# 13 Share Your Insight [132]

- Since writing is nothing more than the revision of a rough draft, which is nothing more than turning a series of notes into a continuous text, which are written on a day-to-day basis, connected and indexed in the slip-box, there is no need to worry about finding a topic to write about. Just look into your slip-box and see where clusters have been built up. [132]
- Now you can spread out these notes on your desktop or use the outliner of the Zettelkasten, outline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will make questions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in the argument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work. [132]

## 13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip-box-Storming [133]

- While we want to find topics that are important, interesting and can be dealt with using the material we have available, the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant. [133]
- It makes things worse that we tend to like our first ideas the best and are very reluctant to let go of them, irrespective of their actual relevance (Strack and Mussweiler 1997). [134]
- We don’t need to worry about the question of what to write about because we have answered the question already – many times on a daily basis. Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not. Every time we make a permanent note, we also made a decision about the aspects of a text we regarded as relevant for our longer-term thinking and relevant for the development of our ideas. [134]
- As soon as the slip-box has grown a bit, we can replace our thoughts on what is interesting and what we think is relevant with a pragmatic look into the slip-box, where we can plainly see what truly proved to be interesting and where we found material to work with. [135]

## 13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up [136]

- Starting with what we have also comes with another, unexpected advantage: We become more open to new ideas. [136]
- Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new. [136]

## 13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests [137]

- When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve, 2009). [137]
- The risk of losing interest in what we do is high when we decide upfront on a long-term project without much clue about what to expect. We can mitigate this risk considerably by applying a flexible organisation scheme that allows us to change course whenever necessary. [137]

## 13.4 Finishing and Review [139]

- A key point: Structure the text and keep it flexible. [139]
- The key is to structure the draft visibly. [139]
- The problem in this stage is almost exactly the opposite of the “blank screen.” Instead of not knowing how to fill the pages, we have so much at hand that we have to curb our impulse to mention everything at the same time. [139]
- Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. [140]
- The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls “verbund.” This is a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomes the resource for another, which again produces by-products that can be used in other processes and so on, until a network of production lines becomes so efficiently intertwined that there is no chance of an isolated factory competing with it anymore. [140]
- Remember: Luhmann’s answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. “When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.” [141]

## 13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning [141]

- The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal. [142]
- The other lesson is not that we can’t learn from our experiences, but that we can only learn from our experiences if feedback follows shortly afterwards – and maybe more than once in a while. [143]
- If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon. That means that the most important step is to get started. Rituals help, too (Currey 2013). [144]
- But the biggest difference lies in the task you are facing to start with. It is much easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as “writing a note,” “collect what is interesting in this paper” or “turning this series of notes into a paragraph” than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like “keep working on that overdue paper.” [144]

## 13.6 The Actual Writing [144]

- If there is one piece of advice that is worth giving, it is to keep in mind that the first draft is only the first draft. [144]
- One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument – “kill your darlings.”[42] This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later. [145]

# 14 Make It a Habit [145]

- The most reliable predictor of our behaviour in the immediate future is – surprise, surprise – the intention to do it. [145]
- There is one exception, though: we most certainly act according to our intention if we happen to intend to do exactly what we used to do before. [146]
- The trick is not to try to break with old habits and also not to use willpower to force oneself to do something else, but to strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones. [146]
- The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. [146]
- If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box. [146]
- The more pressure we feel, the more we tend to stick to our old routines – even when these routines caused the problems and the stress in the first place. This is known as the tunnel effect (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013). But Mullainathan and Shafir, who examined this phenomenon thoroughly, also found a way out of it: Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple. [150]
- And that is the very good news at the end. The slip-box is as simple as it gets. Read with a pen in your hand, take smart notes and make connections between them. Ideas will come by themselves and your writing will develop from there. There is no need to start from scratch. Keep doing what you would do anyway: Read, think, write. Just take smart notes along the way. [152]
