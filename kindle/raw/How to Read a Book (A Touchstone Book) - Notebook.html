But knowledge is not as much a prerequisite to understanding as is commonly supposed. We do not have to know everything about something in order to understand it; too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding.

A piece of writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intended to the whole of it. The amount the reader “catches” will usually depend on the amount of activity he puts into the process, as well as upon the skill with which he executes the different mental acts involved.

Part Two: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 60
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The first rule of analytical reading can be expressed as follows: RULE 1. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 64
</div>
<div class="noteText">
We have already discussed a rough classification of books. The main distinction, we said, was between works of fiction, on the one hand, and works conveying knowledge, or expository works, on the other hand. Among expository works, we can further distinguish history from philosophy, and both from science and mathematics.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 66
</div>
<div class="noteText">
To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from knowing what is the case to knowing what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere. This can be summarized in the distinction between knowing that and knowing how. Theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 68
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Questions about the validity of something are theoretical, whereas to raise questions about the end of anything, the purpose it serves, is practical.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 69
</div>
<div class="noteText">
A practical book will soon betray its character by the frequent occurrence of such words as “should” and “ought,” “good” and “bad,” “ends” and “means.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 69
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In contrast, a theoretical book keeps saying “is,” not “should” or “ought.”

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 70

<div class="noteText">
The essence of history is narration. History is knowledge of particular events or things that not only existed in the past but also underwent a series of changes in the course of time.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 70
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Science is not concerned with the past as such. It treats of matters that can happen at any time or place. The scientist seeks laws or generalizations. He wants to find out how things happen for the most part or in every case, not, as the historian does, how some particular things happened at a given time and place in the past.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 71
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Philosophy is like science and unlike history in that it seeks general truths rather than an account of particular events, either in the near or distant past. But the philosopher does not ask the same questions as the scientist, nor does he employ the same kind of method to answer them.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 71
</div>
<div class="noteText">
If a theoretical book emphasizes things that lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is a scientific work. If not, it is philosophical.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 6. Pigeonholing a Book >  Page 72
</div>
<div class="noteText">
This does not mean that the philosopher is a pure thinker and the scientist merely an observer. Both have to observe and think, but they think about different sorts of observations. And however they may have arrived at the conclusions that they want to prove, they prove them in different ways, the scientist by pointing to the results of his special experiences, the philosopher by pointing to experiences that are common to all.

A proposition in a book is also a declaration. It is an expression of the author’s judgment about something. He affirms something he thinks to be true, or denies something he judges to be false. He asserts this or that to be a fact. A proposition of this sort is a declaration of knowledge, not intentions. The author may tell us his intentions at the beginning in a preface. In an expository book, he usually promises to instruct us about something. To find out whether he keeps those promises, we must look for his propositions.

But unless we are exclusively interested in the author’s personality, we should not be satisfied with knowing what his opinions are. His propositions are nothing but expressions of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons. If it is the book and the subject with which it deals that we are interested in, and not just the author, we want to know not merely what his propositions are, but also why he thinks we should be persuaded to accept them.

There are only two differences between finding the terms that words express and the propositions that sentences express. One is that you employ a larger context in the latter case. You bring all the surrounding sentences to bear on the sentence in question, just as you used the surrounding words to interpret a particular word.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 9. Determining an Author’s Message >  Page 124

Because of all this, we suggest another formulation of RULE 7, as follows: FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE ITS IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT.

what we have just said applies to the great majority of disagreements. They can be resolved by the removal of misunderstanding or of ignorance. Both cures are usually possible, though often difficult. Hence the person who, at any stage of a conversation, disagrees, should at least hope to reach agreement in the end. He should be as much prepared to have his own mind changed as seek to change the mind of another. He should always keep before him the possibility that he misunderstands or that he is ignorant on some point. No one who looks upon disagreement as an occasion for teaching another should forget that it is also an occasion for being taught.

If we really know something, in this sense, we must believe that we can convince others of what we know. Opinion, in the sense in which we have been employing the word, is unsupported judgment.

I. THE FIRST STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR FINDING WHAT A BOOK IS ABOUT 1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. 2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. 3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. 4. Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve. II. THE SECOND STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR INTERPRETING A BOOK’S CONTENTS 5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words. 6. Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences. 7. Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences. 8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve. III. THE THIRD STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR CRITICIZING A BOOK AS A COMMUNICATION OF KNOWLEDGE A. General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette 9. Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”) 10. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously. 11. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make. B. Special Criteria for Points of Criticism 12. Show wherein the author is uninformed. 13. Show wherein the author is misinformed. 14. Show wherein the author is illogical. 15. Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete. Note: Of these last four, the first three are criteria for disagreement. Failing in all of these, you must agree, at least in part, although you may suspend judgment on the whole, in the light of the last point.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 189
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The most important thing to remember about any practical book is that it can never solve the practical problems with which it is concerned. A theoretical book can solve its own problems. But a practical problem can only be solved by action itself.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 189

Practical books can, however, state more or less general rules that apply to a lot of particular situations of the same sort.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 189
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In other words, the reader himself must add something to the book to make it applicable in practice. He must add his knowledge of the particular situation and his judgment of how the rule applies to the case.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 190

<div class="noteText">
Practical books thus fall into two main groups. Some, like this one, or a cookbook, or a driver’s manual, are primarily presentations of rules.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 190
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The other kind of practical book is primarily concerned with the principles that generate rules.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 191
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In the other kind of practical books, the kind dealing mainly with the principles underlying rules, the major propositions and arguments will, of course, look exactly like those in a purely theoretical book.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 191
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Since the ultimate problems to be solved are practical— problems of action, in fields where men can do better or worse— an intelligent reader of such books about “practical principles” always reads between the lines or in the margins. He tries to see the rules that may not be expressed but that can, nevertheless, be derived from the principles. He goes further. He tries to figure out how the rules should be applied in practice.

<div class="noteText">
This brief discussion gives you a clue to the two major questions you must ask yourself in reading any sort of practical book. The first is: What are the author’s objectives? The second is: What means for achieving them is he proposing?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 194

The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the recognition of it for what it is. Only hidden and undetected oratory is really insidious.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 13. How to Read Practical Books >  Page 196
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Agreement with a practical book, however, does imply action on your part. If you are convinced or persuaded by the author that the ends he proposes are worthy, and if you are further convinced or persuaded that the means he recommends are likely to achieve those ends, then it is hard to see how you can refuse to act in the way the author wishes you to.

The reasons you give will, of course, have some critical relevance to the book itself, but in their first expression they are more likely to be about you— your preferences and prejudices— than about the book.

You must pass from saying what you like or dislike and why, to saying what is good or bad about the book and why.

when summaries of an author’s argument are presented, they must be presented in that language and not the author’s.

I. SURVEYING THE FIELD PREPARATORY TO SYNTOPICAL READING 1. Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books. 2. Inspect all of the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which are germane to your subject, and also to acquire a clearer idea of the subject. Note: These two steps are not, strictly speaking, chronologically distinct; that is, the two steps have an effect on each other, with the second, in particular, serving to modify the first. II. SYNTOPICAL READING OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY AMASSED IN STAGE I 1. Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage I in order to find the most relevant passages. 2. Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not. 3. Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not. 4. Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the authors’ views on matters that may not have been their primary concern. 5. Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated. Note: Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to insure this is always to accompany an interpretation of an author’s views on an issue with an actual quotation from his text.
