No planning is involved, just momentary joining to get a little job done. No surprise that scientists call this parallel play. But let’s see what is positive here.

In Level 3, children pursue their loosely defined common interests. But at least they are aware that there are “other” interests. They show a level of self- control (well sometimes at least) in that they don’t bash each other’s sand creations. Back in 1932, Parten called this associative play. You know you are seeing Level 3 when children appear more interested in one another than in the toys they are playing with.

LEVEL 4: BUILDING IT TOGETHER
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1145
</div>
<div class="noteText">
there are some universal characteristics that underlie these collaborations:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1145
</div>
<div class="noteText">
First, these pairs all had a clear goal:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1148
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Second, trust between the collaborators is necessary.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1151
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Finally, the input of each member must be valued and there must be a sense of joint responsibility for the product that emerges. This also involves having respect for one another and the self- control to let each person speak his or her mind.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1156
</div>
<div class="noteText">
At Level 4, we see what Parten called collaborative play. 27 They plan together, define rules, and assign roles to each other.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1178
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In the best Level 4 style, communities (in business, in science, in engineering, and many others) solve problems together. Organizations that collaborate at Level 4 rarely have management offer solutions from the top down; instead, solutions percolate from the bottom up as groups work together to find answers.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1213
</div>
<div class="noteText">
How can parents support their children’s development of Level 4 collaboration? Parents can look at their kids’ schools to see if joint projects are encouraged or if kids are always working alone (desks in rows or in circles?). If collaboration is encouraged, it means that kids understand there is a common goal and can explain it to you when you ask and that the input of each group member is valued. After- school programs should be encouraging collaboration too because kids are often starved for interacting with their peers by the time they arrive at aftercare.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1219
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Once we’ve established that we can work together, we do so by setting up strong lines of communication that allow us to build a common vocabulary and hear one another’s narratives.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1237
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The first step toward creating more sophisticated collaboration is by identifying opportunities for turn taking and sharing. Then by scaffolding our child’s behavior (“ It would be so nice to let Alvin have the next turn”) and reflecting on what they did, we reward positive social behavior: “Wow, you were such a good sharer. Thanks for letting Alvin put that piece in the puzzle.” There are an infinite number of teachable moments that present themselves for encouraging children to work with others rather than going it alone.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1264
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Now none of this precludes us from having downtime or from being independent. It just means that just as we seek moments to grow rugged individualism, we must also seek moments to grow our social skills.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 1267
</div>
<div class="noteText">
However, these “soft skills” take practice, too, and there are plenty of opportunities to move our children from being the independent soul to one who also embraces the chance to build something as a part of a team.
