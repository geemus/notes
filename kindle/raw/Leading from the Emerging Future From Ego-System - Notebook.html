Thus, in an externality- unaware financial system like the one we have today, money flows the wrong way: Those who are innovative, step into new ideas, or even work intentionally with lower returns in order to create societal benefits pay the highest prices, while those who may already have more than they really need pay the lowest prices.

The eight disconnects that we listed above represent a decoupling of two worlds: a decoupling of the structure of societal reality from the structure of economic thought. We could also say that they’re a decoupling of the structures of eco- system reality from the structures of ego- system awareness.

What is missing from how this story unfolded is a moment of reflective disruption in which all players would have come together, looked in the mirror, and realized what they were doing to themselves.

The blind spot of our time is that we take mainstream economic thought for granted, as if it were a natural law. But in reality, all so- called economic laws begin to melt and morph into something else the moment you begin to change the most important variable: the quality of awareness of the participants in a system.

The journey from ego- system to eco- system awareness, or from “me” to “we,” has three dimensions: (1) better relating to others; (2) better relating to the whole system; and (3) better relating to oneself. These three dimensions require participants to explore the edges of the system and the self.

Presencing is a blended word combining sensing (feeling the future possibility) and presence (the state of being in the present moment). It means sensing and actualizing one’s highest future possibility— acting from the presence of what is wanting to emerge.

Principles of Presencing

With an open mind, we can suspend old habits of thought. With an open heart, we can empathize, or see a situation through the eyes of someone else. With an open will, we can let go and let the new come.

Going through that gate means encountering the two root questions of our journey: “Who is my Self?” and “What is my Work?” The capital- S Self is our highest future possibility. The capital- W Work is our sense of purpose or calling.

the moment we commit ourselves to going on this journey, we start to encounter our three principal enemies: the voice of doubt and judgment (VoJ: shutting down the open mind), the voice of cynicism (VoC: shutting down the open heart), and the voice of fear (VoF: shutting down the open will).

absencing throws us into a trajectory of denial (not seeing what is going on), de- sensing (lacking empathy with the other), absencing (losing the connection to one’s higher Self), delusion (being guided by illusions), and destruction (destroying others and ourselves).

As discussed in the introduction, these issue areas share common characteristics. Among them are that they (1) embody systemic structures that are designed not to learn; (2) are unaware of externalities; (3) facilitate money flowing the wrong way; and (4) allow special- interest groups to rig the system to the disadvantage of the whole.

The positive accomplishment of a state- driven society, which we call Society 1.0, is its stability. The central power creates structure and order and calms the random violence that preceded it.

We call this new capacity ABC— awareness- based collective action— because it arises from places that facilitate the capacity of the system to see itself, to sense what wants to emerge, and to explore the future by doing (prototyping).

What do you do when you are part of a system whose vital components operate in separate silos? Answer: You connect them. You shift the locus of leadership from the center to the periphery— that is, from one place to many places. You connect these places in ways that facilitate sense- making in more distributed, direct, and dialogic ways.

stages of economic development and its underlying logic. The purpose of the 1.0 company is control over the entire value chain. The logic revolves around economies of scope; the focus is on vertical integration (for example, the old IBM). The purpose of the 2.0 company is profit. The logic revolves around economies of scale, and the focus is on horizontal integration (for example, Intel and Microsoft). The purpose of the 3.0 company is eco- system domination. The logic revolves around network economies. Examples are Apple, Facebook, and Google. The purpose of the 4.0 company is eco- system stewardship. The logic revolves around economies of presencing— that is, around sensing and actualizing emerging futures.

1. Openness: Leadership shifts from inside an organization to the surrounding sphere. 2. Transparency: Information must be transparent, not secret. 3. Sharing: Ownership of goods must be accessible and intelligently shared. 4. Intention: Organizing revolves around common intention, not structures. 5. Holding space: Co- creative communities require high- quality core groups and holding spaces. 6. Conversation: Shift from levels 1 and 2 (toxic, transactional) to levels 3 and 4 (dialogic, co- creative). 7. Awareness: Shift the primary mode of operating from ego- system to eco- system awareness. 8. Commons: Identify, protect, and cultivate the commons as base of the whole eco- system. 9. Playfulness: Create a culture that values playfulness, entrepreneur- ship, and co- creation. 10. Diversity and symbiosis: These are the twin principles that allow eco- systems to thrive.

8 Leading from the Emerging Future: Now

<div class="noteText">
At the outset of this book we posed three questions: 1. In the face of disruption, how do we lead from the emerging future? 2. What evolutionary economic framework can guide our journey forward? 3. What strategies can help us to function as vehicles for shifting the whole? In exploring these questions, we laid out three big ideas.

The first is that there are two fundamentally different modes of learning: learning from the past and learning from the emerging future.

The second big idea concerns the Matrix of Economic Evolution (table 3). The matrix suggests that the evolution of economic structures follows the evolution of human consciousness— or, to be more precise, that they are highly interdependent.
