# Managing Oneself (Harvard Business Review Classics) by Peter Ferdinand Drucker

## WHAT ARE MY STRENGTHS? (2)

- The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. (3)
- Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie—and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that deprives you of the full benefits of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And finally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform. (5)
- Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. (5)
  - First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. (5)
  - Second, work on improving your strengths. (5)
  - Third, discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it. (6)
- It is equally essential to remedy your bad habits—the things you do or fail to do that inhibit your effectiveness and performance. (7)
- feedback will also reveal when the problem is a lack of manners. (8)
- If analysis shows that someone’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners. (8)
- Comparing your expectations with your results also indicates what not to do. (9)
- One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. (9)
- Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent person into a star performer. (10)

## HOW DO I PERFORM? (10)

- Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by working in ways that they best perform. (11)
- A few common personality traits usually determine how a person performs. (11)
- Am I a reader or a listener? (11)
  - Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa. (15)
- How do I learn? (15)
  - Of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, understanding how you learn is the easiest to acquire. (18)
  - When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know the answer. (18)
  - But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer yes. (18)
  - And yet, acting on this knowledge is the key to performance; or rather, not acting on this knowledge condemns one to nonperformance. (18)
- Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? (19)
- Do I produce results as a decision maker or as an adviser? (20)
  - This is a reason, by the way, that the number two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. (20)
- Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environment? (21)
- Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? (21)

## WHAT ARE MY VALUES? (22)

- That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? (23)
- To work in an organization whose value system is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. (23)
- Whether a business should be run for short-term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. (26)
- A person’s strengths and the way that person performs rarely conflict; the two are complementary. But there is sometimes a conflict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not fit with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof (29)
- Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. (30)

## WHERE DO I BELONG? (30)

- But most people, especially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, however, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. (31)
- Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be structured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should expect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am.” (32)
- Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. (32)

## WHAT SHOULD I CONTRIBUTE? (33)

- Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three distinct elements: What does the situation require? Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? (34)
- So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half (36)
- the results should be hard to achieve—they should require “stretching,” to use the current buzzword. But also, they should be within reach. (36)
- the results should be meaningful. They should make a difference. (37)
- results should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable. (37)
- From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. (37)

## RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELATIONSHIPS (37)

- Managing yourself requires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. (38)
- The first is to accept the fact that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are. (38)
  - To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the values of your coworkers. (38)
  - Bosses are neither a title on the organization chart nor a “function.” They are individuals and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to find out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. (39)
  - The same holds true for all your coworkers. (40)
- The second part of relationship responsibility is taking responsibility for communication. (40)
  - Even people who understand the importance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufficiently with their associates. (43)
  - Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be expected to deliver,” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” (43)
  - And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” (44)
  - In fact, knowledge workers should request this of everyone with whom they work, whether as subordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. (44)
- Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. (44)

## THE SECOND HALF OF YOUR LIFE (45)

- There are three ways to develop a second career. (47)
- The first is actually to start one. (47)
  - Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: (47)
  - But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: (47)
- The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. (48)
  - But in addition, they create a parallel job, usually in a nonprofit organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. (48)
- Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. (49)
  - In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activity, usually a nonprofit. (49)
- There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. (50)
- There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experiencing a serious setback in his or her life or work. (52)
- such times, a second major interest—not just a hobby—may make all the difference. (53)
- In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. (53)
- In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive officer. (56)
- Every existing society, even the most individualistic one, takes two things for granted, if only subconsciously: that organizations outlive workers, and that most people stay put. (56)
- But today the opposite is true. Knowledge workers outlive organizations, and they are mobile. The need to manage oneself is therefore creating a revolution in human affairs. (56)
