Speaking of which, ownership is a key distinction between Inner and Outer communities. In an Inner community the member feels a shared sense of responsibility and ownership in the project (hence wanting to be treated as a team member). In an Outer community members feel ownership of their app/ product but not of the platform they are building it on. Think carefully about this relationship with ownership and how it affects your community.

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 139

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 149

I suggest you follow my Four Rules for Measuring Effectively.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 156
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Rule 1: Test Critical Dimensions
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 156
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In a community there are seven primary critical dimensions that I see in most cases (not in any priority order):
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 156
</div>
<div class="noteText">
1. Growth. How many people are joining your community? How is the growth changing over different time periods?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 156
</div>
<div class="noteText">
2. Retention. Of those people who join the community, how many are sticking around and participating?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 157
</div>
<div class="noteText">
3. Community ↔ Community Engagement. How are people collaborating together? Are they engaging and working together?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 157
</div>
<div class="noteText">
4. Company ↔ Community Engagement. How effectively are your staff engaging with the community?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 157
</div>
<div class="noteText">
5. Delivery. Is the community delivering results within that audience persona? For example, are Support personas answering questions, are Developers producing code, and are Content Creators producing useful content? Is the community delivering value in your campaigns and initiatives?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 157
</div>
<div class="noteText">
6. Attendance. How well attended are your in- person events, online webinars, campaigns, and other initiatives?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 157
</div>
<div class="noteText">
7. Efficiency. How efficient are your various processes such as your onboarding, collaboration processes, conflict resolution, and other elements?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 158
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Rule 2: Measure Both Action and Validation
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 158
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The problem here was that the forum measured only the action of posting something. What it didn’t measure was the validation of that thing: whether the action is any good or not.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 159
</div>
<div class="noteText">
As a general rule, tracking the action is a great way to measure engagement and delivery. Tracking the validation is a great way to measure the quality of that engagement. Focus on tracking both where you can.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 159
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Rule 3: A Matter of “Yes” or “No”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 159
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When you ask the question “Did we accomplish this,” it should be answerable with a clear “yes” or “no,” and not a “maybe.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 160

<div class="noteText">
Rule 4: Limit What You Measure
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 161
</div>
<div class="noteText">
If you have five Big Rocks and you are tracking two to three critical dimensions in each, those are the things you need to measure.

Here’s the key point to remember: maturity models show you the framework of what to measure, but you need to fill in the details yourself.

Here’s how it works. Along the bottom axis you can see the phases from our Community Participation Framework back in chapter 5. It includes the Casual, Regular, and Core segments, but it also includes Onboarding, as this is a critical component of assessing success. For each segment we define what success should look like. This is measured using a few different dimensions.

<div class="noteHeading">

First you incubate new skills. You build an environment with the right mix of resources, education, strategy, and execution that (a) brings in new skills, (b) trains people in them, and (c) supports them as they apply those skills.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 171

We then focus on intention. You take the lessons learned in the incubation phase and become intentional about them. You produce organizational Standards of Practice, train people in them, and ask people to refine and evolve them. This generates your internal playbook for how to do this work well based on your growing experience.

There are three approaches to mentoring, all which can add incredible value.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 203
</div>
<div class="noteText">
1. Peer- Based Review.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 204
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Peer review is one of the most powerful ways of scaling out how your members provide actionable feedback to other members.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 204
</div>
<div class="noteText">
because this happens out in the open, everyone can benefit from seeing the feedback, even if they are simply an observer, thus building a history of how the project was built.

<div class="noteText">
2. Coaching:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 205
</div>
<div class="noteText">
I usually recommend this in handpicked scenarios. When I have done this before, at any one time I would identify three to five people who I thought showed notable potential in the community.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 205
</div>
<div class="noteText">
I then identify members who I know can provide high- quality coaching (preferably with prior experience teaching/ training) and ask them if they would be open to mentoring those members.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 205

The tricky thing with coaching is that there are always significantly more people who need coaching than mentors available.

3. Training:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 206

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 206

In a nutshell: when we map the right rewards to the right incentives, they can generate desirable human behavior, which in turn generates value.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 212

Every incentive has three fundamental ingredients
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 214
</div>
<div class="noteText">
1. The Goal: First, what is the desired behavior you want to incentivize?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 214
</div>
<div class="noteText">
2. The Reward. Go back to your audience personas and look at the Motivations section. What kind of rewards and recognition motivates them?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 215
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When designing your rewards, always start with intrinsic rewards first.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 215

<div class="noteText">
Intrinsic rewards build satisfaction and belonging.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 216

3. The Condition: The final piece of the puzzle is the condition. That is, what measurable criteria needs to be met to accomplish the reward?
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 216
</div>
<div class="noteText">
There are four considerations in deciding on your condition:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 217
</div>
<div class="noteText">
1. Be Measurable.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 217

</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 217

<div class="noteText">
2. Be Representative. Does this condition represent the behavior you want to see?

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 217

3. Be Varied in Difficulty.

Our fundamental goal is to plot a series of incentives that keep people transitioning forward, first to the on- ramp, then to Casual, on to Regular, and then to Core. Strategically, you should build your first set of incentives at the transition points between these phases,
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 220
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Stated incentives are clearly communicated opportunities for community members to participate in. They are published and have clear criteria and rewards.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 220

Submarine incentives are the sneaky cousin to stated incentives. They are preprogrammed ways in which we can detect great community participation and then validate and reward it in a human, personal way.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 223
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Submarine incentives are one tool for dealing with this problem. They are preprogrammed incentives and rewards that, when triggered, provide an opportunity for us to engage personally with a member. This allows us to scale up and still be personal.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">

When considering submarine incentives, there are a few important rules to follow:
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 225
</div>
<div class="noteText">
1. Make them fair.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 225
</div>
<div class="noteText">
2. Keep the recipe secret.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 225
</div>
<div class="noteText">
3. Mix extrinsic and intrinsic rewards.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 225
</div>
<div class="noteText">
4. Make them personal.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 226
</div>
<div class="noteText">
5. Build in access and engagement.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 226
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Use submarine incentives to trigger opportunities for access and influence.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 226

<div class="noteText">
6. Start small and build up.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 228
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Reputation is commonly a numerical representation of an individual member’s participation in your community.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 228
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Importantly, reputation should decay over time.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 229
</div>
<div class="noteText">
If you do calculate a reputation score, it can be a fantastically useful metric for (a) seeing the spread of the least to most active members, (b) spotting trends in activity, (c) determining how your users are divided across our Casual, Regular, and Core phases, and (d) providing a Condition (that we discussed earlier) for your incentives and rewards.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 229
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Think carefully if you should publish your member reputation scores. If you have a community that is designed to be competitive in nature (such as a game), it might make a lot of sense to publish it. If your community is more collaborative in nature (such as an Inner Collaborator community), you might not want to.

Out of this work, and studying gamification in other communities (e.g., multiplayer games, exercise groups, and others), I recommend you follow a key set of rules.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 233
</div>
<div class="noteText">
1. First, focus on onboarding and skills acquisition.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 233
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Don’t gamify based on repetition of activity (e.g., tenth post, one hundredth post, one thousandth post) as this can be easily abused.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 233
</div>
<div class="noteText">
2. As you design your gamification platform, discovery is critical.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 234
</div>
<div class="noteText">
3. Gamification needs a clear path forward. When you design a gamification system, it is easy to find dependencies. For example, if you want to gamify someone submitting an idea in a community for the first time, you may want to first gamify them registering an account.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 234
</div>
<div class="noteText">
4. As you do this work, set clear expectations. Provide simple, step- by- step instructions for what the member needs to do to accomplish the reward.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 234
</div>
<div class="noteText">
5. Be sure to protect against “gaming the system.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 234
</div>
<div class="noteText">
6. Throughout this, be careful of elevated egos.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 234
</div>
<div class="noteText">
You should always ensure that your messaging and engagement makes it clear that gamification is one way of participating, but there are many other ways in which people add value.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 235

<div class="noteText">
Incentives are a powerful way to keep your members interested, engaged, and rewarded. Importantly though, always keep the personal touch front and center as you do this work. Communities thrive on personal relationships.
