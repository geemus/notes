A meeting leader should take a minute to think and make an informed guess based on some key factors: the nature of the meeting’s goals, the people invited to the meeting (discussed in a later chapter), and an analysis of past meetings. The same leader can also, at times, ask others for input and thoughtfully use that feedback, which only serves to engender attendee buy-in to time limits once they have been established. After considering these variables, don’t be wary of scheduling meetings with odd lengths. For example, a forty-eight-minute meeting is just fine if that is the right fit. These odd times attract attention and curiosity and may even be a little fun.

The meeting leader should never be afraid, no matter the length of a meeting, to end a meeting early: (1) when it looks as if the meeting goals have been met (no need to drag it out), or (2) when the attendees seem to be just spinning their wheels and are not being productive. In the case of the latter, sometimes just stopping and regrouping at a later time or using a different communication medium (e.g., email) can be just what is needed to ultimately turn a losing effort into a winning one.

By adding employee input to the meeting agenda, you are increasing the chances of hitting topics of critical importance to all who are present. This all can be executed simply by sending an email three to five days before the meeting asking for topics to include on the agenda (I sometimes recommend having attendees include a reason why this agenda item should be included).

After identifying the potential topics and goals of the meeting (emerging both from self-reflection and from others’ input), as the meeting leader you need to carefully reflect on the importance of the goals and whether each is adding true value— value beyond opportunity costs (i.e., time that could be spent elsewhere). Drop content that does not make the cut. Also, drop content if the goal is only relevant to a small subset of attendees; in this case, it is best pursued in a different context.

Now that you have this information at hand, you can start making decisions leveraging the following rules of thumb. First, it might be the case in looking at your agenda items that certain items should be addressed in close proximity to one another. By doing so, your agenda will tell a better “story.” Second, if all else is generally equal, I like the idea of prioritizing employee-generated agenda items. This sends a strong message around voice, inclusion, and shared ownership. Third, although meetings should always start on time and all items on the agenda should be important, the very first part of the meeting can contain some “warm-up” types of items, thus serving as a little buffer if individuals are late and, more importantly, as a means to build momentum (e.g., sharing quick announcements, sharing quick updates from the last meeting).

Seven or fewer is the ideal group size for decision-making and problem-solving. Eight to twelve attendees is doable if the leader has outstanding facilitation skills.

<div class="noteText">
First and foremost, in examining your agenda and the goals listed, it might be the case that you could split the agenda items in a compelling manner, thus allowing you to hold two smaller and shorter meetings rather than one larger, more expansive meeting. This allows you to keep meeting sizes in check.

The second technique leverages a timed-agenda approach described in the last chapter. With this technique, the meeting boundary becomes porous— certain individuals arrive at certain times and leave at certain times. This is an ideal approach for being highly inclusive but without feeling the weight of too many attendees.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Chapter 6 The Bigger, the Badder >  Page 75

<div class="noteText">
A spin-off of this approach, which I prefer, is to order the agenda items such that the first items are relevant to the larger group of folks, but then after that item is completed, a group of attendees leaves and the remaining individuals continue on with the meeting.

<div class="noteHeading">

you want them to still feel some sense of voice, you can formally or informally survey these individuals in advance— they can provide input on a series of prompts that will be discussed in the meeting itself.

Detailed meeting notes are often taken (1) to help attendees remember what was actually said during the meeting, (2) to help attendees recognize that what they said was actually heard as it was documented, and, most importantly, (3) to promote post-meeting actions being taken by directly responsible individuals as recorded in the meeting. These notes, however, can also be used to promote feelings of inclusion among those not attending meetings.

Let me start at the end of the story: sometimes it would be incredibly helpful and productive if meeting attendees would just stop talking for an extended period of time. As crazy as it might sound on the surface, there are a host of techniques that cultivate silence to create dynamic, engaging, and rich meetings. Silence can be golden, especially for generating and evaluating ideas in meetings. In this chapter, we will review the case for silence as a panacea for many meeting ills.

The leader’s meeting mindset is a key predictor of meeting success. In Chapter 3, I explained the concept of a giver or servant leader; this mindset drives how the meeting leader facilitates the meeting. If you adopt this mindset, you will plan and lead your meetings with the understanding that it is your duty to make the meeting a good use of time and value for all.

The leader manages crucial meeting dynamics: engaging all attendees, asking the right questions, modeling active listening, drawing out input, playing traffic officer, and managing emergent conflict.

Silent reading can increase employees’ understanding and retention of the new idea and it can also save time by cutting out the presentation and decreasing pre-meeting preparation.

The Bottom Line
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Chapter 11 Putting It All Together >  Page 137
</div>
<div class="noteText">
First, meetings allow individual attendees to interpersonally connect with one another, which serves to build relationships, networks, and, most important, support.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Chapter 11 Putting It All Together >  Page 137
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Second, meetings can be an ideal venue to bring together ideas, thoughts, and opinions— things that should help each person perform his or her job in a better, more coordinated and cooperative manner.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Chapter 11 Putting It All Together >  Page 137

Third, meetings enable leaders and employees alike to create a shared understanding that promotes efficiency and teamwork.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Chapter 11 Putting It All Together >  Page 137
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Fourth, meetings build commitment to goals, initiatives, and broader aspirations that may not be explicitly stated in any individual job description. Employees can see they are part of something bigger than themselves.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Chapter 11 Putting It All Together >  Page 138

Finally, meetings bring individuals together as a coherent whole. As a result, this coherent whole can be more adaptive, resilient, and self-directing, especially in the face of crises.

Try, reflect, and learn. Not only will you see a direct improvement in your meetings, but the process will communicate to those around you that you are willing to experiment, to take reasonable risks, and to grow.
