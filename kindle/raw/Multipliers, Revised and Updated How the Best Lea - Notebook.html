ONE The Multiplier Effect

<div class="noteText">
The reason for the difference is that when people work with Multipliers, they hold nothing back. They offer the very best of their thinking, creativity, and ideas. They give more than their jobs require and volunteer their discretionary effort, energy, and resourcefulness. They actively search for more valuable ways to contribute. They hold themselves to the highest standards. They give 100 percent of their abilities to the work— and then some.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 368
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Our research confirmed that Multipliers not only access people’s current capability, they stretch it. They get more from people than they knew they had to give. People reported actually getting smarter around Multipliers.

“The resource allocation task of top management has received too much attention when compared to the task of resource leverage. . . . If top management devotes more effort to assessing the strategic feasibility of projects in its allocation role than it does to the task of multiplying resource effectiveness, its value- added will be modest indeed.”

<div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
Instead of achieving linear growth by adding new resources, leaders rooted in the logic of multiplication believe that you can more efficiently extract the capability of your people and watch growth skyrocket by multiplying the power of the resources you have.

The Diminisher’s view of intelligence is based on elitism and scarcity. Diminishers appear to believe that really intelligent people are a rare breed and that they are of that rare breed. From this assumption they conclude that they are so special, other people will never figure things out without them.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 472
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In addition to seeing intelligence as a scarce commodity, our research showed that Diminishers regard intelligence as something basic about a person that can’t change much; they believe it is static, not able to change over time or circumstance.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 485

<div class="noteText">
In addition, Multipliers see intelligence as continually developing.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 490
</div>
<div class="noteText">
They think like one manager we interviewed who takes stock of her team members by asking herself, “In what way is this person smart?” In answering this question, she finds colorful capabilities often hidden just below the surface. Instead of writing people off as not worth her time, she is able to ask, “What could be done to develop and grow these capabilities?” She then finds an assignment that both stretches the individual and furthers the interests of the organization.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 493
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Multipliers look at the complex opportunities and challenges swirling around them and think, There are smart people everywhere who will figure this out and get even smarter in the process. And they see that their job is to bring the right people together in an environment that liberates everyone’s best thinking— and then to get out of their way and let them do it!
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 517

<div class="noteText">
The Diminisher is an Empire Builder who acquires resources and then wastes them. The Multiplier is a Talent Magnet who utilizes and increases everyone’s genius.

Diminishers are Decision Makers who try to sell their decisions to others. Multipliers are Debate Makers who generate real buy- in.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 547

<div class="noteText">
The Diminisher is a Micromanager who jumps in and out. The Multiplier is an Investor who gives others ownership and full accountability.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 556
</div>
<div class="noteText">
They expect great things from their people and drive them to achieve extraordinary results. They are beyond results- driven; they are tough and exacting. Indeed, Multipliers make people feel smart and capable, but they don’t do it by being “feel- good” managers. They look into people and find capability, and they want to access all of it and utilize people to their fullest. They see a lot, so they expect a lot.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 578
</div>
<div class="noteText">
It’s not that these Multipliers shrink so that others can be big. It’s that they play in a way that invites others to play big, too.

Perhaps one of our biggest surprises was realizing how few Diminishers understood the restrictive impact they were having on others.

Empire Builders seek to surround themselves with A players. But, unlike Talent Magnets, they accumulate talent to appear smarter and more powerful.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 779

Empire Builders hoard resources and underutilize talent. Talent Magnets attract talented people and use them at their highest point of contribution.

A Talent Magnet knows that genius comes in many forms.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 839
</div>
<div class="noteText">
In their quest to assemble the finest talent, Talent Magnets are blind to organizational boundaries. They see multiple forms of intelligence everywhere. Talent Magnets live in a world without walls and without hierarchical or lateral restrictions. Instead, they see talent networks.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 846
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The idea is simple. Multipliers understand that people love to contribute their genius. If they put in the effort to figure out someone’s genius, they have opened a pathway for that person to contribute.

A native genius or talent is something that people do, not only exceptionally well, but absolutely naturally. They do it easily (without extra effort) and freely (without condition).

Once a Talent Magnet has uncovered the native genius of others, he or she looks for opportunities that demand that capability.

Empire Builders ensure that they, themselves, are the point of integration. You can often spot an Empire Builder because he or she either operates exclusively through one- on- one meetings or runs staff meetings as an official report- out from each fiefdom.

Robert operates as a peer to everyone he works with and is accessible to all. One of his managers said of him, “He is very good at disarming you. He is a commoner— one of us. Even if you work three levels below him, he still wants to know what you think.” As a result, people are more transparent around him. They don’t feel like they have to tell him what he wants to hear.

Tyrants create a tense environment that is full of stress and anxiety. Liberators like Robert, on the other hand, create an intense environment that requires concentration, diligence, and energy. It is an environment where people are encouraged to think for themselves and also where people experience a deep obligation to do their best work.

Liberators also give people space to make mistakes. They create an environment of learning, but they expect people to learn from the mistakes. Another fair trade: I give you permission to make mistakes; you have an obligation to learn from the mistakes and not repeat them.

In framing an issue, there are four parts to a well- crafted frame: ￼ THE QUESTION: What is the decision to be made? What are we choosing between? ￼ THE WHY: Why is this an important question to answer? Why does the decision warrant collective input and debate? What happens if it is not addressed? ￼ THE WHO: Who will be involved in making the decision? Who will give input? ￼ THE HOW: How will the final decision be made? Will it be made by majority rule? Consensus? Or will you (or someone else) make the final decision after others provide input and recommendations?

Multipliers may relish a great debate, but they pursue debate with a clear end: a sound decision. They ensure this in three ways. First, they reclarify the decision- making process.

As people watched these debates, they came to a better understanding of the issues. When decisions were reached, there were people at all levels of the organization ready to execute.
