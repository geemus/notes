# Thinking About the Future: Guidelines for Strategic Foresight

## 1. Framing

### 1.1 Adjust Attitudes

* Have positive expectations about the future.
* Know your biases.
* Recognize that self-delusion and wishful thinking are barriers to strategic foresight.
* Use whole brain processes.
* Embrace complexity in addition to linear thinking.
* Recognize that different changes occur at different rates and will have different impacts at different times.

### 1.2 Know the Audience

* Learn as much as possible about the organization.
* Find out what the organization is trying to get done and what's keeping it's people awake at night.
* Don't try to make clients into foresight professionals

### 1.3 Understand the Rationale and Purpose

* Explore the future to influence the present.
* Seek to improve the mental model of decision-makers.
* Balance exploration and exploitation.
* Evaluate whether the problem as presented is really the problem to be solved.

### 1.4 Set Objectives

* Define objectives in terms that can be measured.
  * Strategic Activities - aimed at helping the organization answer a known question or address a known issue.
  * Creative Activities - bring fresh thinking to organizations stuck in self-constructed "boxes."
  * Educational Activities - typically broken out, but really a means for improving strategic or creative objectives.
* Focus on outcomes, not outputs.
* Work in multiple time horizons.
* Weave "outside and then" with "inside and now"
  * Translation makes "outside and then" understandable so it can be used to improve the organizations existing policies/strategies/plans, it's "inside and now".
  * Transformation reshapes the organizations purpose/niche/identity using learning from "outside and then" to transform "inside and now"
  * Assessing capacity for transformation can be done with six questions from Beck and Cowan's Spiral Dynamics. If all six are not present, don't try transformation, yet.
    * Does the potential exist for people to think differently?
    * Do solutions exist for unresolved problems?
    * Is there sufficient dissonance about the present?
    * Is there insight about alternatives?
    * Are the barriers to transformation identified and addressable?
    * Is support available during transformation?

### 1.5 Select the Team

* Recognize that strategic foresight is a team sport.
* Make strategic foresight as immersive and interactive as possible.
* Include people who do not agree.
  * Disagreement can come from differences in information/knowledge and/or differences in fundamental assumptions/values. Both are important sources for new learnings.
  * Jim Collins guidelines for creating a "climate where the truth is heard" once objective is established and everyone agrees to work for it:
    * Lead with questions, not answers.
    * Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.
    * Conduct autopsies, without blame.
    * Build "red flag" mechanisms (ways for people to raise objections without penalty)

### 1.6 Create a Strategic Work Environment

* Create an environment conducive to open and uninhibited thinking.
* Encourage experiments and prototypes.
  * Gary Hamel suggests creating a "marketplace for ideas", essentially bringing venture capitalism inside the organization. ie managers could be given a small percentage of their budget to give to any in-house project of interest to them, anywhere in the org.

## 2. Scanning

### 2.1 Map the System

* Adopt a global perspective.
* Map the system under consideration.
* Take an integral view of the issue.
* Conduct a stakeholder analysis.

### 2.2 Study History

* Start by looking backwards.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Be wary of past success that leads to thinking in a rut.
  * Keep in mind that all performance follows "S-curve": slow, rapid, diminishing returns. When things slow, it's time to change things up.
  * Need to manage two aspects of culture: "How do we handle risk?" and "How do we handle failure?"

### 2.3 Scan the Environment

* Scan the environment for awareness of how the context is changing.
* Integrate the external and internal.
* Explore unfamiliar and "uninteresting" areas.
* Don't try to win with research, not all the data exists

### 2.4 Involve Colleagues and Outsiders

* Consult "remarkable people"
* Consult unusual sources, people, and places - including outliers, complainers, and troublemakers
* Design workshops so learning can be integrated in a group setting

## 3. Forecasting

### 3.1 Identify Drivers and Uncertainties

* Uncover the underlying drivers.
* Use a layered approach to get below the surface and see the different types and levels of change.
* Assess fundamental shifts that could impact business-as-usual.
* Look for colliding change trajectories.
* Look for turning points.
* Improve decision-making by reducing uncertainty.

### 3.2 Choose Forecasting Tool(s)

* Use the right approach and tool(s).
* Use at least one formal method.
* Adapt existing methods and models to the situation.
* Combine different techniques to envision a broader range of possible futures.

### 3.3 Diverge - Generate Ideas

* Provoke new lines of thinking with creative approaches and tools.
  * Strategic relatives archetype: learn from other industries.
  * Biostrategy archetype: learn from nature.
  * Science fiction archetype: learn from fiction.
  * Value analysis archetype: learn by concentraiting on desired outcome.
  * "Where there are two alternatives, choose the third". Chinese paradox pointing out there are always more alternatives than assumed.
* Go beyond brainstorming.
* Adapt tried-and-true approaches of creative people to new contexts
* Assume that what is known for certain... is false.
* Explore ideas that cause discomfort.
* Combine rigor with creativity.
* Incorporate analytical and emotional elements for compelling strategic conversations.
* Experience the future first-hand - make use of different sensory experiences.
* When blocked, put it aside and sleep.
* Avoid early convergence of ideas.

### 3.4 Converge - Prioritize Ideas

* Identify and prioritize areas of common ground.
* Balance "realism" with a critical approach.
* Approach trends with skepticism.

### 3.5 Form Alternatives

* Recognize that the baseline forecast is almost always wrong.
  * To uncover assumptions, assume the data is true, but imagine that the forecast is wrong. This may affirm assumptions, but making them explicit allows an examination of limits and weaknesses.
* Explore and craft alternative futures.
  * Forecasting is to prepare for change, but one can prepare without knowing exactly what will happen. Plausible scenarios help prepare for contingencies that may not have been thought of.
* Develop possible, probable, and preferable solutions.
* Emphasize plausible surprises.
  * People will often have a more diverse view than they are willing to volunteer. Consider asking directly something like: "What do you think might happen in the future that most people are not paying enough attention to?"
* Describe how the future will be different from the present.
  * Tell a story of both what the future is like, and how we got from our past to the future.
* Game the future - explore how the rules may change.
  * If the game is cooperative (such as governance), but some are playing competitively (as in politics), consider whether they can be convinced to cooperate or whether they can be ignored.
  * Conversely, competitve games often fundamentally have cooperative aspects, since they are rarely played alone.
  * Consider your goals and those of the other players, and how to know if goals have been achieved. From this who can be trusted and worked with? Who must be competed with? What are the rules? Which rules can be bent/broken? And finally, what strategies will be most effective?
* Check the resulting alternatives for quality and consistency
  * Alternatives are generally evaluated by desirability and probability, but should also be evaluated on consistency and quality.

## 4. Visioning

### 4.1 Identify Implications

* Use alternatives not as the answer, but to help frame the important questions.
  * Consider alternatives in terms of possibilities, formed as "what if?" questions addressing implications of the alternatives for key stakeholders.
  * Basic categories for implications are: society, industry, the organization, and the specific unit or team.
* Get to the second and third order implications.
  * Tool: Jerome Glenn's futures wheel.
* Think of longer-term and unintended consequences.
  * Tool: impossible pairs table
  * It's important to establish a monitoring system to watch for unexpected consequences over time to look for weak signals and allow reaction as early as possible.

### Challenge Assumptions

* Uncover and clarify assumptions.
  * First map system under consideration. Identify key stakeholders as well as forces directly and indirectly influencing the system.
  * After identifying players and forces, prioritize them according to their importance to the issue at hand.
  * Now identify assumptions about their behavior. One approach is to imagine being granted three questions for someone from the future, what would be asked?
  * After identifying assumptions, look for data/information that supports or weakens them.
  * As the activity proceeds and more is learned, revisit the list of assumptions to see if they continue to make sense and revise as needed.
* Challenge conventional wisdom
  * Get everyone involved to air their views on the future of the question at hand. Bringing out tacit assumptions invites scrutiny. Through the ensuing discussion, assumptions will be challenged.
  * Highlight asssumptions to further discussion and scrutiny. Bring in more informed views of the future of the topic of interest.
  * "Official" futures often focus on one or two key changes without regard for others. So collect a more comprehensive list of issues, trends, and driving forces important to the organizations future.
  * With additional issues, trends, and forces identified, help the group see how these forces and trends interrelate and shape each other.
* Assume nothing; question everything
  * Consider the forecast from as many different perspectives as possible.
  * Tool: Sohail Inayatullah's causal-layered analysis (helps identify embedded assumptions)
    * Deconstruction: Who is privileged by this informatio? Who gains from it at economic, social, and other levels? Who is silenced? What are the politics of its truth?
    * Genealogy: Which discourses have been victorious in constituting the present? How have they traveled through history? What have been the points at which the issue has become important or contentious?
    * Distance: Which scenarios make the present remarkable? Make it unfamiliar? Strange? Denaturalize it?
    * Alternative pasts and futures: Which interpretation of the past is valorized? What histories make the present problematic? Which vision of the future is used to maintain the present? Which would undo the unity of the present?
    * Reordering knowledge: How does the ordering of knowledge differ across civilization, gender, and episteme? What or who is "othered?" How does it denaturalize current orderings, making them peculiar instead of universal?
* Identify and tear down taboos ghosting the organization.
  * Be wary of relying on executives for information. They typically see themselves as having answers rather than knowing the right questions to ask.
  * Tackling taboos is difficult, few activities attempt it. One way to indirectly approach is to expose the organization to odd situations and strange questions posed by outsiders.
* Validate assumptions by cross-checking them
  * Uncover and clarify assumptions (see 4.2.1), identify the organizations critical assumptiosn about the future.
  * Gather and interview an interdisciplinary group of at least ten experts and non-experts.
  * Let every expert attribute an expectational probability to every answer and forecast.
  * Analyze the average and spread of expectational probabilities. The spread (standard deviation) is an indicator of reliability. Discuss answers with spreads of two and more with experts.
  * Remember to value the work of mavericks.

## 4.3 Think Visionary

* Develop a strategic vision.
  * Senge suggests five starting points for visioning (ideally shifting toward co-creating):
    * Telling: Boss decrees vision and everyone else follows
    * Selling: Boss knows vision, but needs to get organization to buy in
    * Testing: Boss has idea(s) about vision and wants to know organization's reaction before proceeding
    * Consulting: Boss is putting together vision and wants input from organization
    * Co-Creating: Boss and member of the organization build vision together through a collaborative process
* Put the strategic vision in a time continuum
  * Analyze basic beliefs of the present: mission, business idea, and operating environment.
  * Formulate a preferred direction of development. Can have dimensions, such as spatial, quantitative, and qualitative.
  * After defining direction, choose a specific year to compare progress toward the vision.
* Set strategic goals as stretch goals
  * Collins and Porras suggest four crieteria for BHAG (big hairy audacious goals) or stretch goals:
    * Set with understanding, not bravado.
    * Have a long timeframe - ten to thirty years.
    * Be clear, compelling, and easy to grasp.
    * Directly reflect the organization's core values and core purpose.
* You get what you think - leverage the positive
  * Tool: Appreciative Inquiry (even in the worst crisis there is positive to build upon)
    * Premium placed on language used.
    * Frame as "solution finding" rather than "problem solving".
    * Cooperrider four steps to appreciative inquiry:
      * Discovery: explore organizational system for positive change potential
      * Dreaming: build upon potential to create clear, results-oriented vision
      * Designing: translate higher purpose into organization design to leverage potential in pursuit of vision
      * Destiny: institutionalize the dream and design in the organization
* Remember Dator's Law: Any useful statement about the future should appear to be ridiculous
  * Emphasizes haveng the presence of mind to consider even the most off-the-wall solutions and search for the krenel of a useful idea within them.
* Ask the "what if" questions
* Sense and enable the emerging future

## 5. Planning

### 5.1 Think Strategically

* Enable emergence
  * Like innovation, relies on modular (rather than hierarchical) organization and high levels of interaction among business units
  * To attain synergistic effects, strategy and organization structure must evolve together.
  * Two actions to help achieve emergence:
    * Identify building blocks of the organization.
    * Map out and understand rules that the building blocks use to interact, collaborate, and communicate.
  * By having a modular organization, understanding connections, and encouraging lots of simple interactions, emergent strategies are more likely to occur.
* Make the sociocultural context central
  * Considering different sociocultural contexts can help the organization respond to wider range of needs - be they demographic, sociological, ethnographic, physiological, psychological, etc
* Crafting strategy is about stimulating strategic conversation.
  * Kees van der Heijden suggests steps to improve strategic conversation:
    * Surface mental models through interviews.
    * Connect and integrate these views to "scaffold" conversation.
    * Conversation should be facilitated, not chaired, and group dynamics optimized.
    * Try to avoid normative thinking (what individuals want to happen) and instead focus on what might happen.
  * Organizations that are capable of learning are capable of changing their mental models in response to a changing environment.
* Know what to change and what not to change
  * External environment changes may mean that a strategy that worked and seems to be working is becoming increasingly obsolete.
  * Try to see and help others see that a preoccuptation with "what will change" may lead to futures that nobody will want.
  * Ask "What has been conserved that gives this organization its unique present?" and thus "What should we conserve so that our history continues into the future?"
  * Emphasize the "how": by what means, and what are the obstacles and opportunities?
  * Focusing on what not to change is empowering. The future is unknowable and teams/individuals can feel impotent to affect it.
* Spot areas of strategic choice by identifying critical branching points
  * Fitness entails searching an enormous landscape (or possibility space) to identify and respond to branching points quickly enough to vaid extinction
  * To identify critical branching points, one approach is buliding a schematic of the evolving fitness environment
  * Mapping pathways and branching points suggests not only what the organization should do, but also what to watch

### 5.2 Develop Strategic Options

* Base strategic recommendations on the organization's distinctive attributes
  * Imitating other's best practices is notoriously difficult
  * Once a unique competency is built, it can be leveraged across different products and markets
* Evaluate proposed strategy along multiple dimensions
  * Although there may be multiple criteria, keep each as simple as possible.
  * Avoid quibbling over numbers or trying t oattain precision where simple "high, medium, or low" may suffice.
  * When evaluating against criteria, it may be helpful to include outsiders to provide more objective perspectives.
* Include the "no-go", "most plausible", and "preferred" when recommending options
  * Tool: Issues Paper (no more than two pages, with further details in attachments)
    * Issue: succinctly describe the issue (2-3 lines max)
    * Background: pertinent history on past and present circumstances. ie stakeholders, goals and objectives, previous actions, lessosn learned, etc. (bullets)
    * Options: 3-4 scenarios that seem plausible and possible. Analyze strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of each.
    * Recommendation: preferred option for responsible action
    * Recommendation Rationale: utilize six "W Questions"
* Have contingency plans for surprises
  * Identify possible surprising events.
  * Go beyond isolated events to identiy possible surprising developments and alternative futures.
  * Understand vulnerabilities (parts of the strategy that cannot change quickly).
  * For substantial threats, develop preventative and eventual strategies.

## 6. Acting

* One of the traps of foresight is to do it only once, failing to leverage learning and capabilities developed during earlier projects.

### 6.1 Communicate Results

* Design results for communicability
* Tailor the message to the thinking styles of the audience
  * Start by analyzing the analysis teams thinking style (see 1.1.2)
  * Ideally use a formal assesment tool, but practically utilize an approximation from paying attention to style issues in interviews, executive speeches, and organization documents.
  * Emerging best practice is to combine style assessment with Spiral Dynamics.
* Immerse stakeholders and decision-makers in the alternatives to increase buy-in
  * Organizations, and especially senior execs, do not enjoy being suprised or put on the spot. Ask them for input in advance to give them a stake in the activity and eliminate the element of surprise.
  * Strive for balance between involvement, which helps with buy-in, and manitaining the integrity of the activity and analysis team.
  * Analyst needs to be both tough and diplomatic.
* Be provocative
  * When seeking to make the organization think, or get out of a rut, provoking and offending can work very well.
  * A tried-and-true formula is to first shock or frighten about the current situation, possibly even suggestiing it will go out of business if it doesn't change.
  * Provoking should be done on a regular basis, whereas offending should be used sparingly and cautiously. If offending is chosen carefully and leavened with humor, people will laugh and enjoy and the offense will be short-lived.
* Modularize outcomes - keep the good and deal with the bad
  * When root causes are understood it becomes clear that what actually failed or suceeded were discrete elements of the process.
  * When assessing:
    * Identify and assess modules in the larger activity.
    * Interview decision-makers and active participants representing each module.
    * focus on modules that appear to contain issues, and build deeper understanding of what actually happened.
  * Analysis of interview results can be sorted into "good" and "bad" modules, and communicated to the organization, thus the entire activity need not be deemed a failure. Conversely, even successful activies will have dysfunctional or bad elements that can be learned from.
* Bulid awareness of change through experience, insight, and reframing

### 6.2 Create an Action Agenda

* Create a sense of urgency.
  * John Kotter suggests successful change efforts begin by communication either crisis, potential crisis, or great opportunity. The majority of management (75%+) needs to be convince that the organization can no longer operate as it has.
* Reinforce what the organization is already doing and build from there.
  * Most organizations have an almost automatic evaluation of change based in it's underlying values. Identifying those values makes such judgements explicit and therefore more concious and defensible. This also allows for pointing out other, sometimes competing, values that are not served by a change.
    * Begin by assessing what people already "know" about the future.
    * Identify changes the organization is not yet, or not fully, aware of.
    * Challenge the assumptions that underlie the organization's expectations.
  * Introducing the future is a matter of persuasion: of the analyst's competence, reality of change, and the need to do something about it now.
  * The analyst's job is to serve the organization, and this requires a baseline of empathy and humility.
* Aim the activity at helping to make better decisions.
  * Heifetz and Linsky destinguish between adaptive challenges, which require new learning, and technical challenges, for which the know-how already exists.
  * Four potential choices from GBN (from safest to riskiest):
    * Robust strategy: look for elements common to all options and focus on commonalities.
    * Hedge-your-bets strategy: give equal weight to all foru options, assuming all are equally viable and dividing action equally across them.
    * Core-satellite strategy: emphasize one option as most likely and pay most attention to it, but also pay lesser attention to other options, just in case.
    * Bet-the-farm strategy: selects just one option as the best and invests all its energy in pursuing that option.
* Make decisions without all the desired data.
  * A good way to decided when to stop gathering data is to ask how much it would cost to acquire the next "important" bit of information.
* Create milestones along the path to the preferred future, and celebrate small successes along the way.
  * Define realistic, doable milestones.
  * Ask those involved in implementation to look for indicators the plan is working, however small these might be.
  * Reward change agents - those who are helping to make the plan a reality.
  * Finally keey an eye out for naysayers and persuade them: the project is in fact moving ahead or their attitude is counterprudctive to the goals of the organization.
  * Evidence suggests that it requires up to seven years to effect a meaningful change in organizational culture.
* Recommend investing in at least one unlikely idea
  * This singals to the organization that considering and preparing for alternative futures is important enough to merit investment.
  * To facilitate succesful recommendation of unlikely ideas:
    * Make the need for at least one unlikely idea should be actively promoted in the design of the foresight activity.
    * Find one or more relevant unlikely ideas (not all unlikely ideas qualify for further analysis)
    * Work with the organization to select from among these ideas.
    * Invest sufficient time and effort developing the idea in order to make it credible. Furthermore, the potential consequences of the idea need to be explored and developed.

### 6.3 Create an Intelligence System

* Create an intelligence system aligned by strategic foresight and linked to the planning process.
  * Organizations large enough for formal planning deserve a system for providing relevant and actionable information to the planning process and it's actors.
  * Analysts should identify the key intelligence consumers, and determine how these consumers prefer to receive/digest information used for making decisions.
  * Analysts should then examine the formal planning process. At what point in the annual process is intelligence most useful?
  * Having identified needs, means for fulfilling them must also be identified.
  * Whatever the situation, an explicit system or schedule for developing intelligence should be established.
* Establish an early warning system to detect weak signals.
  * Identify the most important fields of observation.
  * Determine the pivotal questions about the future.
  * Determine pivotal questions about strategic opportunities.
  * Determine sensors.
  * Distribute questions about the future and strategy to team members, asking them to focus on just one.
  * Pick appropriate sources.
  * Much more efficient when sensors network with experts, in effect recruiting second-tier sensors outside the organization.
  * When formalized and streamlined, this can substantially increase the efficiency and benefits of corporate attention and intelligence.
* Look for sources of turbulence in the system.
  * Expanding scanning to include potential sources of turbulence or disruption is always appropriate, but is particularly improntant for more mature organizations.
* Look for indicators that suggest a crisis may be pending
  * Most system variables operate in range around some relativley stable equilibrium point. When the range increases (turbulence or volatility) or the equilibrium point shifts, the system can approach some boundary beyond which it moves it a completely different structure and equilibrium point.
  * Beware, therefore, of far-from-equilibrium conditions. They may indicate crisis is more likely.
* Choose indicators that are easy to understand and collect.
  * The best indicators are so easy to understand and collect that it is obvious what is occuring as soon as the data appears. Otherwise the activity may be judged superfluous and will not - and should not - be continued.
  * Good raw material for leading indicators can be found in asking: How will the organization know when one or another alternative is actually happening? or What would happen first, second, and third were this alternative to actually unfold.
  * Two types of leading indicators:
    * Events: discrete occurences, the stuff of headlines and news items.
    * Variables: continues quantities that vary over time, the stuff of trends and long-term changes.
  * After identifying events and variables, identify where information about them will come from.
  * Finally establish a regular monitoring program with defined responsibilities, such as who is responsible for monitoring each event or variable, the source of info for each, how info will be stored, and to whom the info will be reported.

### 6.4 Institutionalize Strategic Thinking

* Choose, design and make explicit a conceptual framework.
  * Start by articulating the planning framework as it currently exists.
  * Identify the number and type of management meetings that occur and help determine where the locus of decision-making resides for various issues.
  * Once the existing process is delineated, the next step is to compare with the literature and make appropriate recommendations for change.
  * Research different planning frameworks, such as those of Collins and Porras or Kaplan and Norton.
  * Determine how closely the organization's current approach aligns with established frameworks.
  * When organizations fali to make important processes such as planning explicit, decision-makers and staff will have a variety of interpretations of what is important and what needs to be done.
  * The planning process is a tool for better understanding, not a set of forms to be filled out or a list of boxes to be checked. If it feels like the latter, reassess the conceptual framework.
* Develop Future Cadence
  * Future cadence is a balanced, rhythmic flow to studying the future.
  * Beyond the individual, persuading the organization to pay attention to the future on a regular basis will help them build a culture more attuned to change.
* Repeat strategic foresight activities on a regular basis.
  * Like any skill, thinking about the future is something one has to learn, both individually and in group settings.
  * Repitition teaches the analyst to recognize earlier in the process which variables and trends are to be watched or worked out.
  * The value of a strategic claim is time-bound.
* Develop training programs to institutionalize strategic foresight.
  * A common mistake is to seek to educate first, then do project work.
  * Prepare for training requests in advance. Have the program developed, or at least outlined, in order to be ready when the opportunity arises.
  * Focus on teaching the organization when to use strategic foresight and how to apply it, and to teach the underlying principles in ways that can be useful in daily practice.
  * When developing the program, illustrate the ideas with real-life examples from the within the organization whenever possible, to establish credibility.
  * The training program should follow standard best practices for designing learning experiences, such as employing multiple learning styles.
* Reinforce that learning is the best approach for organizations in complex and unpredictable environments.
  * Activities should incorporate opportunities for learning, such as interviews, workshops, and frequent feedback/review sessions.
  * Analyst should aim for iterative relationship with the organization, sharing information back and forth, thus stimulating interest in learning from the activity as well as the activity itself.
  * Senge describes five disciplines of organizational learning in the Dance of Change:
    * Personal mastery
    * Mental models
    * Shared vision
    * Team learning
    * Systems thinking
* Shift attitudes toward receptiveness to change.
  * A simple starting point and approach is to gain agreement that it is important to the organization to improve its receptivity to the new.
  * Next, research and understand the key areas where the organization is concerned with the new.
  * Armed with this knowledge, create a few workshops specifically highlighting the meaning of the program and methods to get some change - focus on behavior and selected content elements.
  * Be sure to connect behavior-oriented push to a programmatic approcah to foresight. Make a concerted effort to show the value.

- 1.3.4 EVALUATE WHETHER THE PROBLEM AS PRESENTED IS REALLY THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED (54)
- 1.4 SET OBJECTIVES (56)
- 1.4.1 DEFINE OBJECTIVES IN TERMS THAT CAN BE MEASURED (56)
- Strategic activities—First, a strategic activity may be aimed at helping the organization answer a known question or address a known issue. (57)
- Creative activities—These entail bringing fresh thinking to organizations stuck in their self-constructed “boxes.” (57)
- Educational activities—Educational activities typically are broken out separately—but they are really a means for improving either the strategic objectives or the creative objectives. (57)
- 1.4.2 FOCUS ON OUTCOMES, NOT OUTPUTS (59)
- 1.4.3 WORK IN MULTIPLE TIME HORIZONS (62)
- 1.4.4 WEAVE “OUTSIDE AND THEN” WITH “INSIDE AND NOW” (64)
- Strategic foresight mediates two types of relationships, which might be termed translation and transformation. (65)
- Translation involves translating “outside and then” so that it can be used to improve the organization’s existing policies, strategies, and plans—its “inside and now.” (65)
- Transformation involves transforming the identity of the organization by reshaping its purpose, niche, or identity, using what’s learned from “outside and then” to transform “inside and now.” (65)
- The simplest way to assess the capacity for transformation is to ask the six questions set out by Beck and Cowan in Spiral Dynamics (1996): Does the potential exist for people to think differently? Do solutions exist for unresolved problems? Is there sufficient dissonance about the present? Is there insight about alternatives? Are the barriers to transformation identified and addressable? Is support available during transformation? If all six are not present, then don’t try transformation. (66)
- 1.5 SELECT THE TEAM (68)
- 1.5.1 RECOGNIZE THAT STRATEGIC FORESIGHT IS A TEAM SPORT (68)
- 1.5.2 MAKE STRATEGIC FORESIGHT AS IMMERSIVE AND INTERACTIVE AS POSSIBLE (70)
- 1.5.3 INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT AGREE (73)
- Disagreements arise from two sources—differences in information and knowledge and differences over fundamental assumptions or values. Both are important sources of new learning. (73)
- Jim Collins (2001:73–80) suggests four guidelines for creating “a climate where the truth is heard” once the objective is established and everyone agrees to work for it: Lead with questions, not answers. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion. Conduct autopsies, without blame. Build “red flag” mechanisms (i.e., ways for people to raise objections without penalty). (74)
- 1.6 CREATE A STRATEGIC WORK ENVIRONMENT (76)
- 1.6.1 CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO OPEN AND UNINHIBITED THINKING (76)
- 1.6.2 ENCOURAGE EXPERIMENTS AND PROTOTYPES (78)
- Strategy expert Gary Hamel (2003) suggests creating a “marketplace for ideas” within the organization—essentially, bringing the concept of venture capitalism inside. For example, managers could be given the opportunity to spend a small percentage of their budgets each year on any in-house project of interest to them, anywhere in the organization. (79)
- 2.0 SCANNING (84)
- 2.1 MAP THE SYSTEM (87)

- 3.4.2 BALANCE “REALISM” WITH A CRITICAL APPROACH (187)
- 3.4.3 APPROACH TRENDS WITH SKEPTICISM (190)
- 3.5 FORM ALTERNATIVES (193)
- 3.5.1 RECOGNIZE THAT THE BASELINE FORECAST IS ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG (193)
- The best method for uncovering assumptions is to accept the data as is—assume it is true—but to imagine that the forecast is wrong. (193)
- Thinking about how the forecast could be wrong even when the data is correct is the process of revealing those assumptions. (194)
- In fact, most of the time one will affirm that the assumption is reasonable. But making them explicit allows an examination of their limits and weaknesses. (194)
- 3.5.2 EXPLORE AND CRAFT ALTERNATIVE FUTURES (196)
- The purpose of forecasting is to be prepared for change. One can be well-prepared without knowing exactly what will happen. (198)
- The analyst thus presents a set of plausible alternative futures (scenarios) to decision-makers so they can be prepared for contingencies they may not have thought of. (198)
- 3.5.3 DEVELOP POSSIBLE, PLAUSIBLE, PROBABLE, AND PREFERABLE SOLUTIONS (199)
- 3.5.4 EMPHASIZE PLAUSIBLE SURPRISES (201)
- Most people have a more diverse view of the future than they usually talk about, because our culture discourages people from sharing forecasts that are not likely. When asked, however, people readily reveal interesting and surprising futures. One question to elicit this information might be, “What do you think might happen in the future that most people are not paying enough attention to?” (203)
- 3.5.5 DESCRIBE HOW THE FUTURE WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT (204)
- To help people describe the future themselves, after reviewing all the forces shaping the future ask them to imagine being Rip Van Winkle or discovering a time machine. They look around, see the landscape, the buildings, the people. What are these people doing? How are they different from the people of today? Imagine talking to them. What are they concerned about? What are they proud of? What problems have they solved, what problems have they created since our own time? Have them tell a story of how they got from their past to the future. (205)
- 3.5.6 WORK BACKWARDS TO DISTINGUISH HOW AN EXTREME SCENARIO COULD UNFOLD (207)
- 3.5.7 GAME THE FUTURE—EXPLORE HOW THE RULES MIGHT CHANGE (210)
- If the game is fundamentally cooperative (such as governance), but some people are playing it competitively (as in politics), the question is whether they can be convinced to cooperate or whether they can be ignored. (211)
- On the other hand, fundamentally competitive games also have their cooperative aspects, since individuals rarely play alone. (211)
- In sum, identifying the game aspect of these situations highlights requirements for achieving the goal: What is the goal? When will it be known that it has been achieved? What are the other players’ goals? Therefore, who can be trusted and worked with? Who must be competed with? What are the rules of the game? Which rules might be broken or bent to achieve the goals? Given that context, what strategies will most effectively achieve the goals? (212)
- 3.5.8 CHECK THE RESULTING ALTERNATIVES FOR QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY (213)
- Alternative futures are traditionally evaluated by two principal criteria: desirability and probability. This guideline suggests two additional criteria: consistency and quality, on the grounds that these are also fundamental to credible alternatives. (213)
- 3.5.9 SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE FUTURES WITH EMPIRICAL DATA (216)
- 4.0 VISIONING (220)
- 4.1 IDENTIFY IMPLICATIONS (223)
- 4.1.1 USE ALTERNATIVES NOT AS THE ANSWER, BUT TO HELP FRAME THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS (223)
- The alternatives need to be explored in terms of possibilities, formed as “what if?” questions. The questions should address implications of the alternatives for the key stakeholders identified earlier in the activity. Some basic categories are implications for (1) society, (2) the industry, (3) the organization, and (4) the specific unit or team within the organization. (223)
- 4.1.2 GET TO THE SECOND- AND THIRD-ORDER IMPLICATIONS (226)
- While implications can simply be thought about one at a time, the traditional method for identifying second- and higher-order implications is the futures wheel, developed by Jerome Glenn in 1971 (Glenn 1972). The method is described in detail in the AC/UNU Millennium Project’s Futures Research Methodology (Glenn and Gordon, 2003). (226)
- 4.1.3 THINK OF LONGER-TERM AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES (228)
- several tools are available for exploring longer-term consequences, such as the impossible pairs table (Finland Futures Academy, 2004). (229)
- Perhaps most important, though, is to establish an effective monitoring system that watches for unexpected consequences over time. Longer-term and unintended consequences, unfortunately, tend to emerge when and where they are not expected. A monitoring process is needed to constantly look for weak signals and enable the organization to react as early as possible. (229)
- 4.2 CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS (232)
- 4.2.1 UNCOVER AND CLARIFY ASSUMPTIONS (232)
- Uncovering hidden assumptions is essential to first-rate foresight work. Hidden assumptions often lie at the root of strategic foresight gone awry; that is, plans fail because an unstated assumption turns out to be incorrect. Even more insidiously, an analyst or other member of the foresight team will unconsciously gravitate to evidence that supports a hidden assumption, or ignore evidence that contradicts it. (232)
- First, map the system under consideration. This includes identifying first the key stakeholders, then the forces directly and indirectly influencing the system. (233)
- After the players and forces are identified, prioritize them according to their importance to the issue at hand. (233)
- Now identify assumptions about the behavior of the key players and forces. One way to do this is to imagine being granted three questions of someone who knows what the future will be, with each answer costing $100,000. What questions would the organization ask about how its future will look ten years from now? Once the assumptions are identified, look for data and information that supports or weakens them. (233)
- As the activity proceeds and more is learned about the issue involved, revisit this list of assumptions and see if they continue to make sense, revising where necessary. (233)
- 4.2.2 CHALLENGE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM (235)
- A core role for analysts who help organizations focus on change is to examine and challenge the official future. In strategic discussions this means discovering and discussing a group’s assumptions about the future. (235)
- First, get everyone involved to air their views on the future of the question at hand. Bringing out tacit assumptions immediately invites scrutiny of them. Through the ensuing discussion, colleagues will begin to challenge each other’s assumptions as well as their own. (236)
- Second, subject these assumptions to further discussion and scrutiny. Bring in more informed views of the future on the topics of interest to the group. (236)
- Third, one of the basic failings of an official future is that it usually makes much of one or two key changes without regard to others. So the next step is to collect a more comprehensive list of issues, trends, and driving forces that are important to the organization’s future. (236)
- Finally, after widening the thinking by looking at additional issues, trends, and forces, the analyst plays a particularly important role by helping the group see how these forces and trends interrelate and shape each other. (236)
- 4.2.3 ASSUME NOTHING; QUESTION EVERYTHING (238)
- Finally, the forecast to be evaluated should be considered from as many different perspectives as possible. A particularly useful approach for this is causal-layered analysis, developed by Sohail Inayatullah (1998) based on the foundational work of Richard Slaughter. (238)
- Five tools he suggests are: (238)
- Deconstruction—Who is privileged by this information? Who gains from it at the economic, social, and other levels? Who is silenced? What are the politics of its truth? (239)
- Genealogy—Which discourses have been victorious in constituting the present? How have they traveled through history? What have been the points at which the issue has become important or contentious? (239)
- Distance—Which scenarios make the present remarkable? Make it unfamiliar? Strange? Denaturalize it? (239)
- Alternative pasts and futures—Which interpretation of the past is valorized? What histories make the present problematic? Which vision of the future is used to maintain the present? Which would undo the unity of the present? (239)
- Reordering knowledge—How does the ordering of knowledge differ across civilization, gender, and episteme? What or who is “othered?” How does it denaturalize current orderings, making them peculiar instead of universal? (239)
- While Inayatullah’s questions are cast at a high level, the discipline of thinking them through can help identify hidden assumptions. It challenges the analyst and the organization to be aware of deeply embedded assumptions about how they view the world, and recognizes that there are other ways to do so. (239)
- 4.2.4 IDENTIFY AND TEAR DOWN TABOOS GHOSTING THE ORGANIZATION (241)
- Be wary of relying solely on top executives for information about what is going on in the organization. Executives typically see themselves as having answers, rather than knowing the right questions to ask. (241)
- Tackling a company’s taboos is, by definition, extremely difficult. Few activities even attempt it. One way to come at it indirectly is to expose the organization to odd situations and strange questions posed by outsiders. (242)
- 4.2.5 VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS BY CROSS-CHECKING THEM (243)
- First, as explained in Guideline 4.2.1: Uncover and clarify assumptions, identify the organization’s critical assumptions about the future. (244)
- Second, gather and interview an interdisciplinary group of at least ten experts and non-experts. (244)
- Third, let every expert attribute an expectational probability to every answer and forecast. (244)
- Finally, analyze the average and spread of the expectational probabilities. (244)
- The spread (standard deviation) is an indicator of reliability. Discuss answers with spreads of two and more with the experts. (244)
- Remember to value the work of mavericks. (244)
- 4.3 THINK VISIONARY (247)
- 4.3.1 DEVELOP A STRATEGIC VISION (247)
- Senge suggests there are five potential starting points for developing a vision. Organizations tend to be at one of these five points. His advice is to gradually shift the organization towards the most desirable of the five points: co-creating. The five stages are: (247)
- Telling—The boss decrees the vision and everyone else follows it. (247)
- Selling—The boss knows the vision, but needs to get the organization to buy in. (247)
- Testing—The boss has an idea or ideas about the vision and wants to know the organization’s reaction before proceeding. (247)
- Consulting—The boss is putting together a vision and wants input from the organization. (248)
- Co-creating—The boss and the members of the organization build the vision together through a collaborative process. (248)
- 4.3.2 PUT THE STRATEGIC VISION IN A TIME CONTINUUM (249)
- Start by analyzing the basic beliefs of the present: mission, business idea, operating environment. (250)
- The next step is to formulate a preferred direction of development for the organization. This preferred direction can have several dimensions, such as spatial, quantitative, and qualitative. (250)
- After defining the direction of development, the organization can choose specific years (2010, 2020…) for expressing its status relative to the preferred course of development—i.e., its progress towards the vision. (250)
- 4.3.3 SET STRATEGIC GOALS AS STRETCH GOALS (252)
- Collins and Porras (1994) suggest four criteria for setting a good BHAG or stretch goal. These goals should: Be set with understanding, not bravado Have a long timeframe—ten to thirty years Be clear, compelling, and easy to grasp Directly reflect the organization’s core values and core purpose (252)
- 4.3.4 YOU GET WHAT YOU THINK—LEVERAGE THE POSITIVE (254)
- This guideline borrows from the appreciative inquiry approach in suggesting that even in the worst organizational crisis, there is much positive to build upon. (254)
- It puts a premium on the language used, suggesting this has a big influence on the mindset and tone of the activity. (254)
- To begin with, rather than framing the visioning process as “problem solving,” consider it “solution finding.” (255)
- Cooperrider (2005) outlines four steps to appreciative inquiry. (255)
- The first, discovery, involves exploring the organizational system for its positive change potential. (255)
- The second and third steps are dreaming and designing. (255)
- Dreaming builds on the positive-change potential uncovered in discovery to create a clear, results-oriented vision. (255)
- Design then translates that higher purpose into an organizational design that leverages this positive potential in pursuit of the vision. (255)
- The last step, destiny, is about institutionalizing the dream and design in the organization. (255)
- 4.3.5 REMEMBER DATOR’S LAW: ANY USEFUL STATEMENT ABOUT THE FUTURE SHOULD APPEAR TO BE RIDICULOUS (257)
- This guideline emphasizes having the presence of mind to consider even the most off-the-wall solutions and search for the kernel of a useful idea within them. (257)
- 4.3.6 ASK THE “WHAT IF” QUESTIONS (259)
- 4.3.7 SENSE AND ENABLE THE EMERGING FUTURE (261)
- 5.0 PLANNING (266)
- 5.1 THINK STRATEGICALLY (269)
- 5.1.1 ENABLE EMERGENCE (269)
- Emergence depends on many of the same business practices that foster innovation, such as modular (rather than hierarchical) organization and a high level of interaction among business units. (269)
- To attain the synergistic effects of emergence, strategy and organizational structure must evolve together. (269)
- Analysts can take two actions to help an organization achieve emergence. (270)
- The first is to identify the building blocks of the organization. (270)
- The second action is to map out and understand the rules that the organizational building blocks use to interact, collaborate, and communicate. (270)
- By having a modular organization, understanding the connections between the pieces, and encouraging lots of simple interactions, emergent strategies are more likely to occur within a business or organization. (270)
- 5.1.2 MAKE THE SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT CENTRAL (272)
- Considering different sociocultural contexts can help the organization respond to a wider range of needs—be they demographic, sociological, ethnographic, physiological, psychological, etc. (272)
- 5.1.3 CRAFTING STRATEGY IS ABOUT STIMULATING STRATEGIC CONVERSATION (274)
- Kees van der Heijden (1996) suggests three steps for improving the strategic conversation. (275)
- First, the mental models of the organizations need to be surfaced through interviewing. (275)
- These views can then be “scaffolded” by connecting and integrating them. (275)
- In particular, the facilitator needs to know how to employ the scaffolding process. The conversation should be facilitated—not chaired—and group dynamics optimized. (276)
- It is also recommended to avoid normative thinking (what an individual wants to happen) and instead focus on what might happen. (276)
- De Geus adds, “[learning’s] essence was to change one’s internal structure to remain in harmony with a changed environment.” Organizations that are capable of learning are capable of changing their mental models in response to a changing environment. (277)
- 5.1.4 KNOW WHAT TO CHANGE AND WHAT NOT TO CHANGE (277)
- Changes in the external environment mean that a strategy that worked years ago, and seems to be working still, is becoming increasingly obsolete with each passing year. (278)
- While acknowledging that the environment is changing and the organization’s strategy needs to be revised, the analyst first needs to see—and to help others see—that a preoccupation with “what will change” could lead to futures that nobody will want. (278)
- The second step is to ask, “What has been conserved that gives this organization its unique present?” (279)
- Thus, the question for the organization is, “What should we conserve so that our history continues into the future?” (279)
- Next, emphasize the “how” of conservation: by what means, and what are the obstacles and the opportunities? (279)
- Focusing on what not to change is empowering. The future is unknowable and teams and individuals can feel impotent to affect it. (279)
- 5.1.5 SPOT AREAS OF STRATEGIC CHOICE BY IDENTIFYING CRITICAL BRANCHING POINTS (280)
- Seen through an ecological lens, fitness entails searching an enormous landscape (or possibility space) to identify and respond to branching points quickly enough to avoid extinction. (280)
- To identify critical branching points, one approach is to build a schematic of the evolving fitness environment. (281)
- Mapping pathways and branching points that may lie ahead will not only suggest what the organization should do, it will define the things to watch. (282)
- 5.2 DEVELOP STRATEGIC OPTIONS (284)
- 5.2.1 BASE STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ORGANIZATION’S DISTINCTIVE ATTRIBUTES (284)
- Imitating the best practices of others is notoriously difficult. (285)
- Moreover, once the unique competency is built, it can be leveraged across different products and markets. (285)
- 5.2.2 EVALUATE PROPOSED STRATEGY ALONG MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS (286)
- Although there are likely to be multiple criteria, each one should be as simple as possible. (287)
- Hours can be wasted quibbling over numbers or trying to attain precision, where a simple “high, medium, or low” may do. (287)
- As the strategy is evaluated according to the criteria, it may be helpful to have outsiders participate to provide a more objective view. (287)
- 5.2.3 INCLUDE THE “NO-GO,” THE “MOST PLAUSIBLE,” AND THE “PREFERRED” WHEN RECOMMENDING OPTIONS (289)
- The Issues Paper format is designed for easy skimming, usually no more than two pages long and with further detail included in attachments. (289)
- Issue: Succinctly describe the issue (two or three lines maximum). (289)
- Background: Provide pertinent history on the past and present circumstances relative to the issue (e.g., stakeholders, goals and objectives, previous actions, lessons learned, and other relevant considerations). This should be in point form with bullets. (289)
- Options: Describe three or four options (scenarios) that seem plausible and possible. Analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of each of the options. (289)
- Recommendation: Describe the preferred option for responsible action (290)
- Recommendation Rationale: Utilize the six “W Questions.” (290)
- 5.2.4 HAVE CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR SURPRISES (291)
- The first step in developing contingency plans is to identify possible surprising events. (292)
- Second, go beyond isolated events to identify possible surprising developments and alternative futures. (292)
- Third, understand the vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are the parts of the strategy that cannot change quickly. (292)
- Lastly, for substantial threats, develop preventive and eventual strategies. (292)
- 6.0 ACTING (297)
- One of the traps of foresight is to do it only once, failing to leverage the learning and capabilities developed during earlier projects. (297)
- 6.1 COMMUNICATE RESULTS (299)
- 6.1.1 DESIGN RESULTS FOR COMMUNICABILITY (299)
- 6.1.2 TAILOR THE MESSAGE TO THE THINKING STYLES OF THE AUDIENCE (302)
- The analysis team should start by analyzing its own thinking style (see Guideline 1.1.2: Know your biases (302)
- It would be ideal to be able to assess the organization’s thinking styles using a formal assessment tool, but this is rarely practical. More common is making a best approximation of the styles apparent. A lot can be learned by paying attention to style issues during interviews or updates, attending executive speeches, or analyzing organizational documents for clues. (303)
- An emerging best practice is to combine a style assessment with Spiral Dynamics, an assessment tool that gets at thinking “content.” (303)
- 6.1.3 IMMERSE STAKEHOLDERS AND DECISION-MAKERS IN THE ALTERNATIVES TO INCREASE BUY-IN (305)
- Organizations, and especially senior executives, do not enjoy being surprised or put on the spot. Asking for their input beforehand gives them a stake in the activity and eliminates the element of surprise. (305)
- the rule of thumb is to strive for a balance between involvement, which helps with buy-in, and maintaining the integrity of the activity and the analysis team. (305)
- The analyst needs to be both tough and diplomatic. (306)
- 6.1.4 BE PROVOCATIVE (307)
- When the mandate is to make the organization think, or get it out of a rut, provoking and offending can work very well. (307)
- A tried-and-true formula is to first shock or frighten the organization about its current situation, even suggesting that it will go out of business if it doesn’t change. (308)
- Provoking should be done on a regular basis. By contrast, offending should be used sparingly and cautiously. If offending remarks are chosen carefully and leavened with humor, people will laugh and actually enjoy them, and the offense will be short-lived. (308)
- 6.1.5 MODULARIZE OUTCOMES—KEEP THE GOOD AND DEAL WITH THE BAD (310)
- When the root causes of a failure, or a success, are understood, it becomes clear that what actually failed or succeeded were discrete elements of the process. (310)
- When assessing an activity, the first step is to identify and assess modules in the larger activity. (310)
- Next, interview the decision-makers and other active participants representing each of the modules. (310)
- Next focus on the modules that appear to contain the issues, and build a deeper understanding of what actually happened. (310)
- Analysis of the interview results can be sorted into the “good” and “bad” modules, and communicated to the organization. Thus, the entire activity does not to be deemed a failure. Conversely, even successful activities will have their dysfunctional or “bad” elements that can provide opportunities for learning. (311)
- A better approach, of course, is to avoid getting into the situation in the first place through greater understanding of the market fundamentals of and organizational readiness. (311)
- 6.1.6 BUILD AWARENESS OF CHANGE THROUGH EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT, AND REFRAMING (312)
- 6.2 CREATE AN ACTION AGENDA (316)
- 6.2.1 CREATE A SENSE OF URGENCY (316)
- According to John Kotter (1995), successful change efforts begin with a leader communicating a sense of either crisis, potential crisis, or great opportunity. (316)
- The majority of those in management—Kotter suggests 75%—need to be convinced that the organization can no longer operate as it has. (316)
- 6.2.2 REINFORCE WHAT THE ORGANIZATION IS ALREADY DOING AND BUILD FROM THERE (318)
- Most organizations have an almost automatic evaluation of whether a particular change is good or bad for it. Such evaluations, however, are based on underlying values—the root of evaluation. Identifying those values makes the basis of such judgments explicit and therefore more conscious and defensible. At the same time, the analyst can also point out other, sometimes competing, values that are not served by that change. (319)
- Begin by assessing what people in the organization already “know” about the future. (319)
- Identify changes the organization is not yet, or not fully, aware of. (319)
- Next, challenge the assumptions that underlie the organization’s expectations. (320)
- Introducing an organization to the future is a matter of persuasion: not only of the analyst’s competence, but also of the reality of change and the need to do something about it now. (320)
- The analyst’s job is to serve the organization, and this requires a baseline of empathy and humility. (321)
- 6.2.3 AIM THE ACTIVITY AT HELPING TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS (322)
- Heifetz and Linsky (2002) make the important distinction between adaptive challenges and technical challenges. Adaptive challenges require new learning in order to be addressed, while technical challenges are those for which the necessary know-how already exists. (322)
- The former scenario-planning firm Global Business Network developed a useful framework for organizing options. Assuming there are four potential choices facing the team and clients, the options range as follows, from safest to riskiest: A robust strategy looks for elements common to all four options and focuses on these commonalities. A hedge-your-bets strategy gives equal weight to all four options; that is, it assumes all four are equally viable and divides the action equally across them. A core-satellite strategy emphasizes one option as the most likely and pays the most attention to it, but also pays lesser attention to the other options just in case. A bet-the-farm strategy selects one option as the best and invests all its energy in pursing that option. (322)
- 6.2.4 MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT ALL THE DESIRED DATA (324)
- A rule of thumb in making the decision about when to stop gathering information is to ask how much it would cost to acquire the next “important” bit of information. (325)
- 6.2.5 CREATE MILESTONES ALONG THE PATH TO THE PREFERRED FUTURE, AND CELEBRATE SMALL SUCCESSES ALONG THE WAY (327)
- First, define the milestones. Be sure they are realistic and doable. Next, ask those involved in the implementation to be on the lookout for indicators that the plan is working effectively, however small these might be. Be sure to reward the change agents—those who are helping to make the plan a reality. Also be ready to make mid-course adjustments. If it becomes clear that a milestone is not going to be met, adjust the timeline well before it comes due. Finally, keep an eye out for naysayers. Where possible, meet with them to persuade them that: (a) the project is in fact moving ahead; or (b) their attitude is counterproductive to the goals of the organization. (327)
- There is evidence that it requires up to seven years to effect a meaningful change in organizational culture. (328)
- 6.2.6 RECOMMEND INVESTING IN AT LEAST ONE UNLIKELY IDEA (329)
- This signals to the organization that considering and preparing for alternative futures is important enough to merit investment. (329)
- Three steps will facilitate successful recommendation of unlikely ideas. First, the need for at least one unlikely idea should be actively promoted by making this explicit in the design of the foresight activity. Second, it is important to find one or more relevant unlikely ideas (not all unlikely ideas qualify for further analysis). After compiling this short list of unlikely ideas, the organization needs to make a selection. Third, since the analyst is dealing with an unlikely idea, sufficient time and effort must be spent developing it in order to make it credible. Furthermore, the potential consequences of the idea need to be explored and developed. (330)
- 6.3 CREATE AN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM (332)
- 6.3.1 CREATE AN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM ALIGNED BY STRATEGIC FORESIGHT AND LINKED TO THE PLANNING PROCESS (332)
- Organizations large enough to require a formal planning process deserve to have an appropriately modeled intelligence system for providing relevant and actionable information to the planning process and its actors. (332)
- Analysts should first identify the key intelligence consumers. (332)
- Analysts should determine how these consumers prefer to receive and digest information used for making decisions. (332)
- Analysts should then examine the organization’s formal planning process. (333)
- At what points in the annual process is intelligence most useful? (333)
- Once these needs are identified, the means for fulfilling them must be identified. (333)
- Whatever the situation, an explicit system or schedule for developing intelligence should be established. (333)
- 6.3.2 ESTABLISH AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM TO DETECT WEAK SIGNALS (334)
- First, identify the most important fields of observation. (335)
- Second, determine the pivotal questions about the future. (335)
- Third, determine pivotal questions about strategic opportunities. (335)
- Fourth, determine your sensors. (335)
- Distribute questions about the and about strategy to team members, asking them to focus on just one. (335)
- Finally, pick appropriate sources. (336)
- It is much more efficient when sensors network with experts, in effect recruiting them as second-tier sensors outside the organization. (336)
- When formalized and streamlined, it can substantially increase the efficiency and the benefits of corporate attention and intelligence. (337)
- 6.3.3 LOOK FOR SOURCES OF TURBULENCE IN THE SYSTEM (337)
- Expanding scanning to include potential sources of turbulence or disruption is always appropriate, but is particularly important for more mature organizations. (339)
- 6.3.4 LOOK FOR INDICATORS THAT SUGGEST A CRISIS MAY BE PENDING (341)
- Most system variables operate in range around some relatively stable equilibrium point. When the range increases (turbulence or volatility) or the equilibrium point shifts, the system can approach some boundary beyond which it moves to a completely different structure and equilibrium point. (341)
- Beware, therefore, of far-from-equilibrium conditions. They may indicate a crisis is more likely. (341)
- 6.3.5 CHOOSE INDICATORS THAT ARE EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND COLLECT (344)
- In fact, the best monitoring program uses indicators that are obvious, or at least so easy to understand and collect that it is obvious what is occurring as soon as the data appears. Otherwise the activity might be judged superfluous and will not—and should not—be continued. (344)
- The first question is, “How will the organization know when one or another alternative is actually happening?” In other words, “What would happen first, second, and third were this alternative to actually unfold?” The answers are the raw material for leading indicators. (344)
- Leading indicators come in two types: events and variables. (345)
- Events are discrete occurrences, the stuff of headlines and news items. (345)
- Variables, on the other hand, are continuous quantities that vary over time, the stuff of trends and long-term changes. (345)
- The next step after identifying the events and variables is to identify where the information about the events and variables will come from. (345)
- The final step is to establish a regular monitoring program with defined responsibilities, such as who is responsible for monitoring each event or variable; the source of the information for each; how the information will be stored; and to whom will the information be reported? (346)
- 6.4 INSTITUTIONALIZE STRATEGIC THINKING (348)
- 6.4.1 CHOOSE, DESIGN AND MAKE EXPLICIT A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK (348)
- Begin by articulating the planning framework as it currently exists. (348)
- Identify the number and type of management meetings that occur and help determine where the locus of decision-making resides for various issues. (348)
- Once the existing process is delineated, the next step for an articulated planning process is to compare it with the literature and make appropriate recommendations for change. (348)
- The second step is to conduct research. The point is to identify and become familiar with different planning frameworks, such as those of Collins and Porras (2002) and Kaplan and Norton (2000). (349)
- The third step is to determine how closely the organization’s current approach aligns with established frameworks. (349)
- When organizations fail to make important processes such as planning explicit, decision-makers and staff will have a variety of interpretations of what is important and what needs to be done. (349)
- The planning process is a tool for better understanding, not a set of forms to be filled out or a list of boxes to be checked. If it starts to feel like the latter, reassess the conceptual framework. (350)
- 6.4.2 DEVELOP FUTURE CADENCE (351)
- Future cadence refers to a balanced, rhythmic flow in studying the future. (351)
- Beyond the individual, persuading organizations to pay attention to the future on a regular basis will help them build a culture that is more attuned to change. (351)
- 6.4.3 REPEAT STRATEGIC FORESIGHT ACTIVITIES ON A REGULAR BASIS (353)
- There are three important reasons why foresight activities need to be repeated. (354)
- First, like any skill, thinking about the future is something one has to learn, both individually and in group settings. (354)
- Second, repetition teaches the analyst to recognize earlier in the process which variables and trends are to be watched or worked out. (354)
- Third, the value of a strategic claim is time-bound. (355)
- 6.4.4 DEVELOP TRAINING PROGRAMS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE STRATEGIC FORESIGHT (356)
- A common mistake is to seek to educate first, then do project work. (357)
- Prepare for such requests in advance. Have the program developed, or at least outlined, in order to be ready when the opportunity arises. (357)
- the recommendation of this guideline is to focus the training program on teaching the organization when to use strategic foresight and how to apply it, and to teach the underlying principles in ways that can be useful in daily practice. (357)
- When developing the program, illustrate the ideas with real-life examples from work with the organization, wherever possible. This establishes credibility. (357)
- The training program itself should follow standard best practices for designing learning experiences, such as employing multiple learning styles. (358)
- 6.4.5 REINFORCE THAT LEARNING IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR ORGANIZATIONS IN COMPLEX AND UNPREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENTS (359)
- The design of an activity should incorporate opportunities for learning, such as interviews, workshops, and frequent feedback and review sessions. (359)
- The analyst should aim for an iterative relationship with the organization, continually sharing information back and forth, thus stimulating interest in the learning from the activity as well as in the activity itself. (359)
- Senge et al. describe five disciplines of organizational learning in the Dance of Change (1991, 32). (360)
- The first, personal mastery, (360)
- The second, mental models, (360)
- The third discipline, shared vision, (360)
- The fourth discipline, team learning, (360)
- In the fifth, systems thinking, (360)
- 6.4.6 SHIFT ATTITUDES TOWARDS RECEPTIVENESS TO CHANGE (362)
- A simple starting point and approach is to gain agreement that it is important to the organization to improve its receptivity to the new. (363)
- Next, research and understand the key areas where the organization is concerned with the new. (363)
- Armed with this knowledge, create a few workshops specifically about highlighting the meaning of the program and the methods to get to some change—focusing on the behavior and the selected content elements. (363)
- Be sure to connect the behavior-oriented push to a programmatic approach to foresight. Make a concerted effort to show the value. (363)
