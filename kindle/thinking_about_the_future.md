# Thinking About the Future: Guidelines for Strategic Foresight

## 1. Framing

### 1.1 Adjust Attitudes

* Have positive expectations about the future.
* Know your biases.
* Recognize that self-delusion and wishful thinking are barriers to strategic foresight.
* Use whole brain processes.
* Embrace complexity in addition to linear thinking.
* Recognize that different changes occur at different rates and will have different impacts at different times.

### 1.2 Know the Audience

* Learn as much as possible about the organization.
* Find out what the organization is trying to get done and what's keeping it's people awake at night.
* Don't try to make clients into foresight professionals

### 1.3 Understand the Rationale and Purpose

* Explore the future to influence the present.
* Seek to improve the mental model of decision-makers.
* Balance exploration and exploitation.
* Evaluate whether the problem as presented is really the problem to be solved.

### 1.4 Set Objectives

* Define objectives in terms that can be measured.
  * Strategic Activities - aimed at helping the organization answer a known question or address a known issue.
  * Creative Activities - bring fresh thinking to organizations stuck in self-constructed "boxes."
  * Educational Activities - typically broken out, but really a means for improving strategic or creative objectives.
* Focus on outcomes, not outputs.
* Work in multiple time horizons.
* Weave "outside and then" with "inside and now"
  * Translation makes "outside and then" understandable so it can be used to improve the organizations existing policies/strategies/plans, it's "inside and now".
  * Transformation reshapes the organizations purpose/niche/identity using learning from "outside and then" to transform "inside and now"
  * Assessing capacity for transformation can be done with six questions from Beck and Cowan's Spiral Dynamics. If all six are not present, don't try transformation, yet.
    * Does the potential exist for people to think differently?
    * Do solutions exist for unresolved problems?
    * Is there sufficient dissonance about the present?
    * Is there insight about alternatives?
    * Are the barriers to transformation identified and addressable?
    * Is support available during transformation?

### 1.5 Select the Team

* Recognize that strategic foresight is a team sport.
* Make strategic foresight as immersive and interactive as possible.
* Include people who do not agree.
  * Disagreement can come from differences in information/knowledge and/or differences in fundamental assumptions/values. Both are important sources for new learnings.
  * Jim Collins guidelines for creating a "climate where the truth is heard" once objective is established and everyone agrees to work for it:
    * Lead with questions, not answers.
    * Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.
    * Conduct autopsies, without blame.
    * Build "red flag" mechanisms (ways for people to raise objections without penalty)

### 1.6 Create a Strategic Work Environment

* Create an environment conducive to open and uninhibited thinking.
* Encourage experiments and prototypes.
  * Gary Hamel suggests creating a "marketplace for ideas", essentially bringing venture capitalism inside the organization. ie managers could be given a small percentage of their budget to give to any in-house project of interest to them, anywhere in the org.

## 2. Scanning

### 2.1 Map the System

* Adopt a global perspective.
* Map the system under consideration.
* Take an integral view of the issue.
* Conduct a stakeholder analysis.

### 2.2 Study History

* Start by looking backwards.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Be wary of past success that leads to thinking in a rut.
  * Keep in mind that all performance follows "S-curve": slow, rapid, diminishing returns. When things slow, it's time to change things up.
  * Need to manage two aspects of culture: "How do we handle risk?" and "How do we handle failure?"

### 2.3 Scan the Environment

* Scan the environment for awareness of how the context is changing.
* Integrate the external and internal.
* Explore unfamiliar and "uninteresting" areas.
* Don't try to win with research, not all the data exists

### 2.4 Involve Colleagues and Outsiders

* Consult "remarkable people"
* Consult unusual sources, people, and places - including outliers, complainers, and troublemakers
* Design workshops so learning can be integrated in a group setting

## 3. Forecasting

### 3.1 Identify Drivers and Uncertainties

* Uncover the underlying drivers.
* Use a layered approach to get below the surface and see the different types and levels of change.
* Assess fundamental shifts that could impact business-as-usual.
* Look for colliding change trajectories.
* Look for turning points.
* Improve decision-making by reducing uncertainty.

### 3.2 Choose Forecasting Tool(s)

* Use the right approach and tool(s).
* Use at least one formal method.
* Adapt existing methods and models to the situation.
* Combine different techniques to envision a broader range of possible futures.

### 3.3 Diverge - Generate Ideas

* Provoke new lines of thinking with creative approaches and tools.
  * Strategic relatives archetype: learn from other industries.
  * Biostrategy archetype: learn from nature.
  * Science fiction archetype: learn from fiction.
  * Value analysis archetype: learn by concentraiting on desired outcome.
  * "Where there are two alternatives, choose the third". Chinese paradox pointing out there are always more alternatives than assumed.
* Go beyond brainstorming.
* Adapt tried-and-true approaches of creative people to new contexts
* Assume that what is known for certain... is false.
* Explore ideas that cause discomfort.
* Combine rigor with creativity.
* Incorporate analytical and emotional elements for compelling strategic conversations.
* Experience the future first-hand - make use of different sensory experiences.
* When blocked, put it aside and sleep.
* Avoid early convergence of ideas.

### 3.4 Converge - Prioritize Ideas

* Identify and prioritize areas of common ground.
* Balance "realism" with a critical approach.
* Approach trends with skepticism.

### 3.5 Form Alternatives

* Recognize that the baseline forecast is almost always wrong.
  * To uncover assumptions, assume the data is true, but imagine that the forecast is wrong. This may affirm assumptions, but making them explicit allows an examination of limits and weaknesses.
* Explore and craft alternative futures.
  * Forecasting is to prepare for change, but one can prepare without knowing exactly what will happen. Plausible scenarios help prepare for contingencies that may not have been thought of.
* Develop possible, probable, and preferable solutions.
* Emphasize plausible surprises.
  * People will often have a more diverse view than they are willing to volunteer. Consider asking directly something like: "What do you think might happen in the future that most people are not paying enough attention to?"
* Describe how the future will be different from the present.
  * Tell a story of both what the future is like, and how we got from our past to the future.
* Game the future - explore how the rules may change.
  * If the game is cooperative (such as governance), but some are playing competitively (as in politics), consider whether they can be convinced to cooperate or whether they can be ignored.
  * Conversely, competitve games often fundamentally have cooperative aspects, since they are rarely played alone.
  * Consider your goals and those of the other players, and how to know if goals have been achieved. From this who can be trusted and worked with? Who must be competed with? What are the rules? Which rules can be bent/broken? And finally, what strategies will be most effective?
* Check the resulting alternatives for quality and consistency
  * Alternatives are generally evaluated by desirability and probability, but should also be evaluated on consistency and quality.

## 4. Visioning

### 4.1 Identify Implications

* Use alternatives not as the answer, but to help frame the important questions.
  * Consider alternatives in terms of possibilities, formed as "what if?" questions addressing implications of the alternatives for key stakeholders.
  * Basic categories for implications are: society, industry, the organization, and the specific unit or team.
* Get to the second and third order implications.
  * Tool: Jerome Glenn's futures wheel.
* Think of longer-term and unintended consequences.
  * Tool: impossible pairs table
  * It's important to establish a monitoring system to watch for unexpected consequences over time to look for weak signals and allow reaction as early as possible.

### Challenge Assumptions

* Uncover and clarify assumptions.
  * First map system under consideration. Identify key stakeholders as well as forces directly and indirectly influencing the system.
  * After identifying players and forces, prioritize them according to their importance to the issue at hand.
  * Now identify assumptions about their behavior. One approach is to imagine being granted three questions for someone from the future, what would be asked?
  * After identifying assumptions, look for data/information that supports or weakens them.
  * As the activity proceeds and more is learned, revisit the list of assumptions to see if they continue to make sense and revise as needed.
* Challenge conventional wisdom
  * Get everyone involved to air their views on the future of the question at hand. Bringing out tacit assumptions invites scrutiny. Through the ensuing discussion, assumptions will be challenged.
  * Highlight asssumptions to further discussion and scrutiny. Bring in more informed views of the future of the topic of interest.
  * "Official" futures often focus on one or two key changes without regard for others. So collect a more comprehensive list of issues, trends, and driving forces important to the organizations future.
  * With additional issues, trends, and forces identified, help the group see how these forces and trends interrelate and shape each other.
* Assume nothing; question everything
  * Consider the forecast from as many different perspectives as possible.
  * Tool: Sohail Inayatullah's causal-layered analysis (helps identify embedded assumptions)
    * Deconstruction: Who is privileged by this informatio? Who gains from it at economic, social, and other levels? Who is silenced? What are the politics of its truth?
    * Genealogy: Which discourses have been victorious in constituting the present? How have they traveled through history? What have been the points at which the issue has become important or contentious?
    * Distance: Which scenarios make the present remarkable? Make it unfamiliar? Strange? Denaturalize it?
    * Alternative pasts and futures: Which interpretation of the past is valorized? What histories make the present problematic? Which vision of the future is used to maintain the present? Which would undo the unity of the present?
    * Reordering knowledge: How does the ordering of knowledge differ across civilization, gender, and episteme? What or who is "othered?" How does it denaturalize current orderings, making them peculiar instead of universal?
* Identify and tear down taboos ghosting the organization.
  * Be wary of relying on executives for information. They typically see themselves as having answers rather than knowing the right questions to ask.
  * Tackling taboos is difficult, few activities attempt it. One way to indirectly approach is to expose the organization to odd situations and strange questions posed by outsiders.
* Validate assumptions by cross-checking them
  * Uncover and clarify assumptions (see 4.2.1), identify the organizations critical assumptiosn about the future.
  * Gather and interview an interdisciplinary group of at least ten experts and non-experts.
  * Let every expert attribute an expectational probability to every answer and forecast.
  * Analyze the average and spread of expectational probabilities. The spread (standard deviation) is an indicator of reliability. Discuss answers with spreads of two and more with experts.
  * Remember to value the work of mavericks.

## 4.3 Think Visionary

* Develop a strategic vision.
  * Senge suggests five starting points for visioning (ideally shifting toward co-creating):
    * Telling: Boss decrees vision and everyone else follows
    * Selling: Boss knows vision, but needs to get organization to buy in
    * Testing: Boss has idea(s) about vision and wants to know organization's reaction before proceeding
    * Consulting: Boss is putting together vision and wants input from organization
    * Co-Creating: Boss and member of the organization build vision together through a collaborative process
* Put the strategic vision in a time continuum
  * Analyze basic beliefs of the present: mission, business idea, and operating environment.
  * Formulate a preferred direction of development. Can have dimensions, such as spatial, quantitative, and qualitative.
  * After defining direction, choose a specific year to compare progress toward the vision.
* Set strategic goals as stretch goals
  * Collins and Porras suggest four crieteria for BHAG (big hairy audacious goals) or stretch goals:
    * Set with understanding, not bravado.
    * Have a long timeframe - ten to thirty years.
    * Be clear, compelling, and easy to grasp.
    * Directly reflect the organization's core values and core purpose.
* You get what you think - leverage the positive
  * Tool: Appreciative Inquiry (even in the worst crisis there is positive to build upon)
    * Premium placed on language used.
    * Frame as "solution finding" rather than "problem solving".
    * Cooperrider four steps to appreciative inquiry:
      * Discovery: explore organizational system for positive change potential
      * Dreaming: build upon potential to create clear, results-oriented vision
      * Designing: translate higher purpose into organization design to leverage potential in pursuit of vision
      * Destiny: institutionalize the dream and design in the organization
* Remember Dator's Law: Any useful statement about the future should appear to be ridiculous
  * Emphasizes haveng the presence of mind to consider even the most off-the-wall solutions and search for the krenel of a useful idea within them.
* Ask the "what if" questions
* Sense and enable the emerging future

## 5. Planning

### 5.1 Think Strategically

* Enable emergence
  * Like innovation, relies on modular (rather than hierarchical) organization and high levels of interaction among business units
  * To attain synergistic effects, strategy and organization structure must evolve together.
  * Two actions to help achieve emergence:
    * Identify building blocks of the organization.
    * Map out and understand rules that the building blocks use to interact, collaborate, and communicate.
  * By having a modular organization, understanding connections, and encouraging lots of simple interactions, emergent strategies are more likely to occur.
* Make the sociocultural context central
  * Considering different sociocultural contexts can help the organization respond to wider range of needs - be they demographic, sociological, ethnographic, physiological, psychological, etc
* Crafting strategy is about stimulating strategic conversation.
  * Kees van der Heijden suggests steps to improve strategic conversation:
    * Surface mental models through interviews.
    * Connect and integrate these views to "scaffold" conversation.
    * Conversation should be facilitated, not chaired, and group dynamics optimized.
    * Try to avoid normative thinking (what individuals want to happen) and instead focus on what might happen.
  * Organizations that are capable of learning are capable of changing their mental models in response to a changing environment.
* Know what to change and what not to change
  * External environment changes may mean that a strategy that worked and seems to be working is becoming increasingly obsolete.
  * Try to see and help others see that a preoccuptation with "what will change" may lead to futures that nobody will want.
  * Ask "What has been conserved that gives this organization its unique present?" and thus "What should we conserve so that our history continues into the future?"
  * Emphasize the "how": by what means, and what are the obstacles and opportunities?
  * Focusing on what not to change is empowering. The future is unknowable and teams/individuals can feel impotent to affect it.
* Spot areas of strategic choice by identifying critical branching points
  * Fitness entails searching an enormous landscape (or possibility space) to identify and respond to branching points quickly enough to vaid extinction
  * To identify critical branching points, one approach is buliding a schematic of the evolving fitness environment
  * Mapping pathways and branching points suggests not only what the organization should do, but also what to watch

### 5.2 Develop Strategic Options

* Base strategic recommendations on the organization's distinctive attributes
  * Imitating other's best practices is notoriously difficult
  * Once a unique competency is built, it can be leveraged across different products and markets
* Evaluate proposed strategy along multiple dimensions
  * Although there may be multiple criteria, keep each as simple as possible.
  * Avoid quibbling over numbers or trying t oattain precision where simple "high, medium, or low" may suffice.
  * When evaluating against criteria, it may be helpful to include outsiders to provide more objective perspectives.
* Include the "no-go", "most plausible", and "preferred" when recommending options
  * Tool: Issues Paper (no more than two pages, with further details in attachments)
    * Issue: succinctly describe the issue (2-3 lines max)
    * Background: pertinent history on past and present circumstances. ie stakeholders, goals and objectives, previous actions, lessosn learned, etc. (bullets)
    * Options: 3-4 scenarios that seem plausible and possible. Analyze strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of each.
    * Recommendation: preferred option for responsible action
    * Recommendation Rationale: utilize six "W Questions"
* Have contingency plans for surprises
  * Identify possible surprising events.
  * Go beyond isolated events to identiy possible surprising developments and alternative futures.
  * Understand vulnerabilities (parts of the strategy that cannot change quickly).
  * For substantial threats, develop preventative and eventual strategies.

## 6. Acting

* One of the traps of foresight is to do it only once, failing to leverage learning and capabilities developed during earlier projects.

### 6.1 Communicate Results

* Design results for communicability
* Tailor the message to the thinking styles of the audience
  * Start by analyzing the analysis teams thinking style (see 1.1.2)
  * Ideally use a formal assesment tool, but practically utilize an approximation from paying attention to style issues in interviews, executive speeches, and organization documents.
  * Emerging best practice is to combine style assessment with Spiral Dynamics.
* Immerse stakeholders and decision-makers in the alternatives to increase buy-in
  * Organizations, and especially senior execs, do not enjoy being suprised or put on the spot. Ask them for input in advance to give them a stake in the activity and eliminate the element of surprise.
  * Strive for balance between involvement, which helps with buy-in, and manitaining the integrity of the activity and analysis team.
  * Analyst needs to be both tough and diplomatic.
* Be provocative
  * When seeking to make the organization think, or get out of a rut, provoking and offending can work very well.
  * A tried-and-true formula is to first shock or frighten about the current situation, possibly even suggestiing it will go out of business if it doesn't change.
  * Provoking should be done on a regular basis, whereas offending should be used sparingly and cautiously. If offending is chosen carefully and leavened with humor, people will laugh and enjoy and the offense will be short-lived.
* Modularize outcomes - keep the good and deal with the bad
  * When root causes are understood it becomes clear that what actually failed or suceeded were discrete elements of the process.
  * When assessing:
    * Identify and assess modules in the larger activity.
    * Interview decision-makers and active participants representing each module.
    * focus on modules that appear to contain issues, and build deeper understanding of what actually happened.
  * Analysis of interview results can be sorted into "good" and "bad" modules, and communicated to the organization, thus the entire activity need not be deemed a failure. Conversely, even successful activies will have dysfunctional or bad elements that can be learned from.
* Bulid awareness of change through experience, insight, and reframing

### 6.2 Create an Action Agenda

* Create a sense of urgency.
  * John Kotter suggests successful change efforts begin by communication either crisis, potential crisis, or great opportunity. The majority of management (75%+) needs to be convince that the organization can no longer operate as it has.
* Reinforce what the organization is already doing and build from there.
  * Most organizations have an almost automatic evaluation of change based in it's underlying values. Identifying those values makes such judgements explicit and therefore more concious and defensible. This also allows for pointing out other, sometimes competing, values that are not served by a change.
    * Begin by assessing what people already "know" about the future.
    * Identify changes the organization is not yet, or not fully, aware of.
    * Challenge the assumptions that underlie the organization's expectations.
  * Introducing the future is a matter of persuasion: of the analyst's competence, reality of change, and the need to do something about it now.
  * The analyst's job is to serve the organization, and this requires a baseline of empathy and humility.
* Aim the activity at helping to make better decisions.
  * Heifetz and Linsky destinguish between adaptive challenges, which require new learning, and technical challenges, for which the know-how already exists.
  * Four potential choices from GBN (from safest to riskiest):
    * Robust strategy: look for elements common to all options and focus on commonalities.
    * Hedge-your-bets strategy: give equal weight to all foru options, assuming all are equally viable and dividing action equally across them.
    * Core-satellite strategy: emphasize one option as most likely and pay most attention to it, but also pay lesser attention to other options, just in case.
    * Bet-the-farm strategy: selects just one option as the best and invests all its energy in pursuing that option.
* Make decisions without all the desired data.
  * A good way to decided when to stop gathering data is to ask how much it would cost to acquire the next "important" bit of information.
* Create milestones along the path to the preferred future, and celebrate small successes along the way.
  * Define realistic, doable milestones.
  * Ask those involved in implementation to look for indicators the plan is working, however small these might be.
  * Reward change agents - those who are helping to make the plan a reality.
  * Finally keey an eye out for naysayers and persuade them: the project is in fact moving ahead or their attitude is counterprudctive to the goals of the organization.
  * Evidence suggests that it requires up to seven years to effect a meaningful change in organizational culture.
* Recommend investing in at least one unlikely idea
  * This singals to the organization that considering and preparing for alternative futures is important enough to merit investment.
  * To facilitate succesful recommendation of unlikely ideas:
    * Make the need for at least one unlikely idea should be actively promoted in the design of the foresight activity.
    * Find one or more relevant unlikely ideas (not all unlikely ideas qualify for further analysis)
    * Work with the organization to select from among these ideas.
    * Invest sufficient time and effort developing the idea in order to make it credible. Furthermore, the potential consequences of the idea need to be explored and developed.

### 6.3 Create an Intelligence System

* Create an intelligence system aligned by strategic foresight and linked to the planning process.
  * Organizations large enough for formal planning deserve a system for providing relevant and actionable information to the planning process and it's actors.
  * Analysts should identify the key intelligence consumers, and determine how these consumers prefer to receive/digest information used for making decisions.
  * Analysts should then examine the formal planning process. At what point in the annual process is intelligence most useful?
  * Having identified needs, means for fulfilling them must also be identified.
  * Whatever the situation, an explicit system or schedule for developing intelligence should be established.
* Establish an early warning system to detect weak signals.
  * Identify the most important fields of observation.
  * Determine the pivotal questions about the future.
  * Determine pivotal questions about strategic opportunities.
  * Determine sensors.
  * Distribute questions about the future and strategy to team members, asking them to focus on just one.
  * Pick appropriate sources.
  * Much more efficient when sensors network with experts, in effect recruiting second-tier sensors outside the organization.
  * When formalized and streamlined, this can substantially increase the efficiency and benefits of corporate attention and intelligence.
* Look for sources of turbulence in the system.
  * Expanding scanning to include potential sources of turbulence or disruption is always appropriate, but is particularly improntant for more mature organizations.
* Look for indicators that suggest a crisis may be pending
  * Most system variables operate in range around some relativley stable equilibrium point. When the range increases (turbulence or volatility) or the equilibrium point shifts, the system can approach some boundary beyond which it moves it a completely different structure and equilibrium point.
  * Beware, therefore, of far-from-equilibrium conditions. They may indicate crisis is more likely.
* Choose indicators that are easy to understand and collect.
  * The best indicators are so easy to understand and collect that it is obvious what is occuring as soon as the data appears. Otherwise the activity may be judged superfluous and will not - and should not - be continued.
  * Good raw material for leading indicators can be found in asking: How will the organization know when one or another alternative is actually happening? or What would happen first, second, and third were this alternative to actually unfold.
  * Two types of leading indicators:
    * Events: discrete occurences, the stuff of headlines and news items.
    * Variables: continues quantities that vary over time, the stuff of trends and long-term changes.
  * After identifying events and variables, identify where information about them will come from.
  * Finally establish a regular monitoring program with defined responsibilities, such as who is responsible for monitoring each event or variable, the source of info for each, how info will be stored, and to whom the info will be reported.

### 6.4 Institutionalize Strategic Thinking

* Choose, design and make explicit a conceptual framework.
  * Start by articulating the planning framework as it currently exists.
  * Identify the number and type of management meetings that occur and help determine where the locus of decision-making resides for various issues.
  * Once the existing process is delineated, the next step is to compare with the literature and make appropriate recommendations for change.
  * Research different planning frameworks, such as those of Collins and Porras or Kaplan and Norton.
  * Determine how closely the organization's current approach aligns with established frameworks.
  * When organizations fali to make important processes such as planning explicit, decision-makers and staff will have a variety of interpretations of what is important and what needs to be done.
  * The planning process is a tool for better understanding, not a set of forms to be filled out or a list of boxes to be checked. If it feels like the latter, reassess the conceptual framework.
* Develop Future Cadence
  * Future cadence is a balanced, rhythmic flow to studying the future.
  * Beyond the individual, persuading the organization to pay attention to the future on a regular basis will help them build a culture more attuned to change.
* Repeat strategic foresight activities on a regular basis.
  * Like any skill, thinking about the future is something one has to learn, both individually and in group settings.
  * Repitition teaches the analyst to recognize earlier in the process which variables and trends are to be watched or worked out.
  * The value of a strategic claim is time-bound.
* Develop training programs to institutionalize strategic foresight.
  * A common mistake is to seek to educate first, then do project work.
  * Prepare for training requests in advance. Have the program developed, or at least outlined, in order to be ready when the opportunity arises.
  * Focus on teaching the organization when to use strategic foresight and how to apply it, and to teach the underlying principles in ways that can be useful in daily practice.
  * When developing the program, illustrate the ideas with real-life examples from the within the organization whenever possible, to establish credibility.
  * The training program should follow standard best practices for designing learning experiences, such as employing multiple learning styles.
* Reinforce that learning is the best approach for organizations in complex and unpredictable environments.
  * Activities should incorporate opportunities for learning, such as interviews, workshops, and frequent feedback/review sessions.
  * Analyst should aim for iterative relationship with the organization, sharing information back and forth, thus stimulating interest in learning from the activity as well as the activity itself.
  * Senge describes five disciplines of organizational learning in the Dance of Change:
    * Personal mastery
    * Mental models
    * Shared vision
    * Team learning
    * Systems thinking
* Shift attitudes toward receptiveness to change.
  * A simple starting point and approach is to gain agreement that it is important to the organization to improve its receptivity to the new.
  * Next, research and understand the key areas where the organization is concerned with the new.
  * Armed with this knowledge, create a few workshops specifically highlighting the meaning of the program and methods to get some change - focus on behavior and selected content elements.
  * Be sure to connect behavior-oriented push to a programmatic approcah to foresight. Make a concerted effort to show the value.
