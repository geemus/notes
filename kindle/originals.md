# Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World

* Successful originals begin by questioning defaults and then balance risk portfolios.
* Instead of accepting defaults, you take initiative to seek out options that might be better. When you encounter something you don't like, you fix it. Having taking initiative to improve things, you have little reason to go elsewhere as you have created the job you want.
* People are motivated to rationalize the status quo, even if it is against their interests. "People who suffer the most from a given state of affairs are paradoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or change it." - Jost and colleagues.
* Start with curiosity. Why does the default exist? Recognizing that most have social origins (they were created by people) gives us the courage to contemplate how they can be changed.
* Creative kids are least likely to become teacher's pets.
* Valueing achievement highly can crowd out originality, as you come to dread failure.
* Advocating for new systems often requires demolishing old ways, and we may hold back for fear of rocking the boat.
* Originality doesn't require extreme risk taking, originals are far more ordinary than we realize.
* Manage a risk portfolio. When we embrace danger in one domain, we offset overall risk by exercising caution in another. Having more security in one realm gives us freedom in another.
* Googlers who were randomly assigned to think of their jobs as malleable were happier and more performant. Having considered how their jobs could be modified, they took actiosn to improve them. By deviating from defaults they also qualified themselves for roles that were a better fit. Many realized their limits were of their own making.
* Originals aren't different than the rest of us. They have the same fears and doubts. What sets them apart is that they take action anyway, knowing that they would regret failing less than they would regret not trying.

## Recognizing Original Ideas

* Overconfidence may be particularly difficult to overcome in creative domains. New ideas are by definition unique, so previous feedback may not apply.
* To maximize odds of creating something truly great, create a large number of ideas. More prolific people are more original and have the most original output during their most prolific periods.
* The best way to get better at judging ideas is to gather feedback.
* Managers tend to be too risk averse, focusing on costs of bad ideas rather than benefits of good ones, leading to many false negatives.
* The more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world (Erik Dane research).
* Focus groups tend to be set up in a way that makes the same mistakes as managers (Justin Berg research).
* Fellow creators (colleagues) tend to be the best evaluators and givers of feedback.
* Spending just six minutes developing original ideas made people more open to novelty.
* Those with moderate expertise in a particular domain are most open to radically creative ideas.
* We can gain breadth by widening our cultural repertoire.
* Our intuitions are only accurate in domains where we have a lot of experience (Erik Dane research). Non-experts make sounder judgements through thorough analysis.
* The more successful people have been in the past, the worse they perform when entering a new environment. Overconfidence makes it less likely that critical feedback will be sought, even though the context is radically different.
* When assessing the prospects of a novel idea, it's all too easy to be seduced by the enthusiasm of the people behind it.
* If we want to improve idea selection, we shouldn't look at whether people have been successful. We should look at how they've been successful.
* Instead of limiting idea generation/selection to managers, Warby Parker makes this process completely transparent in a shared document. Everyone in the company can read, comment, and discuss in a biweekly meeting.

## Speaking Truth to Power

* Leaders and managers appreciate iniative when offering to help, building networks, gathering knowledge, and seeking feedback. But speaking up with suggestions can get penalized.
* Need to teas apart two dimensions of social heriarchy: power (exercising control and authority over others) and status (being respected and admired).
* By gaining respect we can also gain what psychologist Edwin Hollander called idiosyncracy credits - latitude to deviate from expectations. These accrue through respect, not rank, and are based on contributions.
* When pitching a novel idea or speaking up with a suggestion for a change, your audience is likely to be skeptical. There are at least four reasons to adopt Griscom's strategy of accentuating the flaws of your idea:
  * Leading with weaknesses disarms the audience. Marketing professors Marian Friestad and Peter Wright find that when we feel that someone is trying to persuade us, we raise our mental shields.
  * It makes you look smart, in that you have done your homework and anticipated problems that would be spotted. People think amateurs can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.
  * Being up front about downsides makes you appear more trustworthy.
  * It leaves the audience with a more favorable assessment of the idea, due to a bias in how we process information. Namely as psychologist Norbert Schwarz has shown, the easier it is to think of something, the more common and important we assume it is (we use ease of retrieval as a signal). By acknowledging serious problems, it makes it harder to think of new problems/critiques.
* If we want people to accept original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat. Professor John Kotter found that change agents typically undercommunicated their visions by a factor of ten.
* Psychologist Robert Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it. Again this may relate to ease of processing. Liking appears to increase as people are exposed to an idea between ten and twenty times, with additional exposure still useful with more complex ideas. Exposures are more effective when short and mixed with other ideas to maintain curiosity. It's also best to introduce delay between presentation and evaluation to let things sink in.
* It's impossible for us to imagine what it's like to listen for the first time because we are already too familiar with our ideas.
* Buliding on economist Albert Hirshman's writings, there are four ways to handle a dissatisfying situation: exit, voice, persistence, and neglect.
* Only when you believe your actions matter and care deeply will you consider speaking up.
* Our sense of commitment and control at work depends more on our direct boss than anyone else.
* As much as agreeable people may love us, they often hate conflict even more. The desire to please others and preserve harmony makes them prone to backing down instead of sticking up for us.
* When we decide to speak up, choosing our audience matters as much as how we deliver the message.
* When managers have a track record of challenging the status quo, they tend to be more open to new ideas and less threatened by contributions of others.
* It may be more effective to voice ideas upward and downward, and spend less time attempting to make suggestions to middle managers. Relates to sociologist George Homon note that middle-status conservatism reflects the anxiety experienced by one who aspires to a social station but fears disenfranchisement.
* Extensive research shows that when women speak up on behalf of others, they avoid backlash, because they're being communal.

## Timing, Strategic Procrastination, and the First-Mover Disadvantage

* Putting off a task buys you time to engage in divergent thinking, rather than foreclosing on one particular idea. (via Shin)
* People have better memory for incomplete than complete tasks. Once finished we stop thinking about it, but when interrupted and left undone, it stays active in our mind. (via Bluma Zeigarnik)
* Procrastinating also keeps us open to improvisation. When we plan in advance, we often stick to the structure we've created, closing the door to creative possibilities that  might spring into view.
* Great originals are great procrastinators, but they don't skip planning altogether. They procrastinate strategically, making gradual progress by testing and refining different possibilities.
* The first-mover advantage is truly in particular industries but is not supported by the research in the general case. First-mover advantage tends to prevail when patented technology is involved, or when there are strong network effects. (via Lisa Bolton)
* Being original doesn't require being first, just being different and better.
* First, when originals rush to be pioneers, they're prone to overstep. When a market is more defined, settlers enter and can focus on superior quality instead of deliberating what to offer in the first place.
* Second, people who choose to be late movers may be better suited to succeed as they balance their risk portfolios and wait for the right opportunity before entering.
* Third, along with being less recklessly ambitious, settlers can improve upon competitors' tech to make products better.
* Fourth, pioneers tend to get stuck in their early offerings, settlers can observe market changes and shifting consumer tastes and adjust.
* As Max Planck observed, "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die."
* When a market is uncertain, unknown, or underdeveloped, benig a pioneer has pronounced disadvantages.
* Just as procrastinating can give task flexibility, delaying market entry can open us to learning and adaptability, and reduce risks asseciated with originality.
* Two styles of innovation. Conceptual innovators are sprinters, formulating big ideas and setting out to execute them. Experimental innovaters are marathoners, solving problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go. (via Galenson)
* To sustain originality as we age and accumulate expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach. We can make fewer plans in advance and test out tentative ideas and solutions. With enough patience we may stumble upon something novel and useful.

## Creating and Maintaining Coalitions

* Even though they share a fundamental objective, radical groups often disparage more mainstream groups as imposters and sellouts, a concept known as horizontal hostility (via Judith White).
* In seeking alliances with groups that share our values, we overlook the importance of sharing our strategic tactics. Even if they care about different causes, groups find affinity when they use the same methods of engagement.
* Simon Sink argues if we want to inspire, we should start with why. If we communicate the vision behind our ideas, and purpose guiding our products, people will flock to us. When you are communicating something that challenges the status quo, though, you have to be careful about how you communicate your why.
* To succeed, originals often must become tempered radicals (via Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully). Shifting from why to how can help people become less radical.
* By opening with moderate asks instead of radical ones, what Robert Cialdini calls the foot-in-the-door technique, you can gain allies.
* Coalitions often fall apart when people refuse to moderate their radicalism.
* Movements need to draw in more casual participants if they are to succeed.
* Insiders and outsiders have distinct ideas about who represents a coalition (via Blake Ashforth and Peter Reingen). For insiders, the key representitive is whomever is most central and connected. For outsiders, the key representative is the person with the most extreme views.
* Enemies make better allies than frenemies. We need to tease apart how positive and how negative a relationship is. Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative relationships (via Bert Uchino). Intuition suggests we should sever bad relationships and salvage ambivalent ones, but evidence suggests the opposite: cut out frenemies and attempt to convert enemies.
* Experiments suggest that we're often more sensitive to gains and losses in esteem than the level of esteem itself (via Elliot Aronson).
* If we convert enemies, avoiding cognitive dissonance will motivate them to maint a positive relationship.
* Our former adversaries are often the most effective a persuading others to join. They can marshall better arguments because they understand the doubts and misgivings, making them a more credible source.
* Our starting point in generating ideas shapes the path, constraining what we imagine.
* To come up with something original, we need to begin from a more unfamiliar place. But more novel starting points don't necessarily make them palatable and practical to our audiences. The most promising ideas begin with novelty then add familiarity, capitalizing on the mere exposure effect.
* Conflicts between two groups are often caused and intensified by conflicts within the group (via Herbert Kelman). To build coalitions you need doves in each group to sit down, listen to each other's perspectives, identify common goals/methods, and engage in join problem solving.

## How Siblings, Parents, and Mentors Nurture Originality

* When we use the logic of consequences, we can always find reasons not to take risks. The logic of appropriateness frees us up. We think less about outcomes and more about what somene like us ought to do. This tendency can be influenced by birth order, with firstborns tending toward more risk aversion and defending the status quo, while laterborns are inclined to challenge the status quo.
* Niche picking may help explain why laterborn may actively seek to be different.
* Firstborns grow up in a world of adults, whereas the more siblings you have, the more time you spend learning from other children. When older siblings serve as surrogate parents and role models, you don't face as many rules or punishments, while still enjoying the security of their protection. You also end up taking risks earlier by following the lead of other children, instead of the carefully considered choices of adults.
* Parenting behaviors can nurture rebellion at any position in birth order, even if they are more common with younger children.
* Parents of highly creative children had an average of less than one rule and tended to emphasize moral values, rather than specific rules (via Teresa Amabile).
* When many rules are enforced, but with clear rationale for their importance, teenagers are substantially less likely to break them, because they internalize them.
* Reasoning does create paradox: leading both to more rule following and more rebelliousness. By explaining moral principles, parents encourage voluntary compliance with rules that align with values and questioning of rules that don't. Good explanations enable the development of a code of ethics which coincides with social expectations; when they don't square up, children can rely on the internal compass of values rather than the external compass of rules.
* A kind of explanation that works especially well in enforcing discipline is explaining why behaviors are inappropriate, often with reference to their consequences for others (via the Oliners). Highlighting consequences for others directs attention to the distress of those who may be harmed, fueling empathy. It also helps children understand the role their own actions play in causing harm, resulting in guilt. The dual moral emotions of empathy and guilt activate the desire to right wrongs of the past and behave better in the future. Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too.
* When our character is praised, we internalize it as part of our identities. Instead of engaging in isolated moral acts, we start to develop a unified self-concet as a moral person.
* Affirming character appears to have the strongest effect in the critical periods when children are beginning to formulate strong identities. In one study, for example, praising character boosted moral actions of 8-year-olds, but not 5-year-olds or 10-year-olds.
* In another study children 3-6 were 22-29% more likely to clean up when asked to be helpers instead of to help. These appeals to character are effective for adults as well, suggesting we should embrace nouns thoughtfully, ie "Don't Be a Drunk Driver" instead of "Don't Drink and Drive." (via Christopher Bryan)
* When we shift emphasis from behavior to character, people evaluate choices differently. Instead of asking whether a behavior will achieve particular results they want, they will take action because it is the right thing to do.
* We can give children more freedom if we explain consequences of their actions on others and emphasize how right moral choices demonstrate good character.
* The paradox of encouraging children to develop strong values is that parents effectively limit their own influence.
* As children grow up, they often don't aim high enough. Having a role model can elevate their aspirations.
* If we want to encourage originality, we can raise our children's aspirations by introducing them to different kinds of role models.
* Finding mentors is not always easy, but we can also use stories of great originals throughout history or even fictional characters.
* Studies show that when children's stories emphasize original achievements, the next generation innovates more.
* By encountering images of originality in history and fiction, the logic of consequence fades. We no longer worry as much about what will happen if we fail.
* Regardless of birth order, having compelling role models for originality expands our awareness of niches that we had never considered.

## The Myths of Strong Cultures, Cults, and Devil's Advocates

* Groupthink - the tendency to seek consensus instead of fostering dissent. The enemy of originality; people feel pressured to conform to the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought.
* Professional blueprint emphasizes hiring based on skills, star blueprint emphasizes hiring based on future potential, and commitment blueprint focuses on hiring based on those matching company values and norms. Professional/Star gave employees autonomy and challenging tasks, whereas commitment worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees and to the organization. Skills and stars are fleeting; commitment lasts. Althought fruitful at first, commitment tends to falter over time.
* Organizations tend to become more homogeneous over time as they attract, select, socialize, and retain similar people, effectively weeding out diversity in thoughts and values. (via Benjamin Schneider)
* As markets become more dynamic, big companies with strong cultures struggle to recognize the need for change and are more likely to resist insights from those who think differently. As a result, they don't learn and adapt, and don't have better or more reliable financial results than their competitors.
* Minority viewpoints are important, not because they tend to prevail but because they stimulate divergent attention and thought. As a result, even when they are wrong they contribute to the detection of novel solutions and decisions that, on balance, are qualitatively better. (via Charlan Nemeth)
* Evidence suggests that social bonds don't drive groupthink; overconfidence and reputational concerns do.
* Bridgewater promotes expressing original ideas. Employees are expected to voice concerns and critiques directly to each other. They are evaluated on whether they speak up, and can be fired for failing to challeng the status quo.
* If you want a strung colture, it's paramount to make diversity one of your core values.
* In hiring, instead of similarity to gauge cultural fit, Bridgewater assesses cultural contribution.
* The goal is an idea meritocracy, where the best ideas win. To get the best ideas on the table in the first place, you need radical transparency.
* Devil's advocate is often ineffective because confirmation bias leads to being more persuaded by affirmation and discounting others. To overcome a majority preference, groups need to consider more articles against than in support of. (via Charlan Nemeth)
* It's better to unearth a devil's advocate than assign one. When designated they just play a role, often not arguing forcefully or consistently enough, and often not being taken seriously. The secret is sincerity, which is hard to fake. They need to believe what they are representing, and the group needs to believe that they believe. Even devil's advocates who did believe were doubted if others knew they were assigned the role. Whereas people doubt assigned dissenters, genuine dissenters challenge people to doubt themselves. Compared to assigned dissenters, authentic dissenters don't make group members substantially angered and they're actually liked slightly more.
* The norm is to have "strong opinions, weakly held" as per futurist Paul Saffo.
* If employees are in sync about making sure that everyone speaks up, they don't need to worry as much about groupthink.
* Cultures that focus too heavily on solutions become cultures of advocacy, dampening inquiry. If you are expected to have an answer ready, you'll arrive with diagnosis complete, missing out on the chance to incorporate other perspectives. When members have different information, inquiry needs to preced advocacy. You need to raise problems before pursuing solutions. (via Hofmann)
* To ensure authentic dissent, Bock created the "Canaries", a group of trusted engineers with diverse viewpoints with a reputation for both being sensitive to adverse conditions and for speaking their minds. They are part advisory board, part focus group, and have become an invaluable safeguard to make sure Googlers' voices are heard.
* Getting problems noted is half the battle, the other is listening to the right opinions about how to solve them. Bridgewater does this by gathering credible people to diagnose, share reasoning, and explore causes and possible solutions.
* At Bridgewater every employee has a believability score on a range of dimensions. When you are about to interact you can see their track record on seventy-seven different dimenions of values, skills, and abilities in the areas of higher-level thinking, practical thinking, maintaining high standards, determination, open-mindedness yet assertiveness, organization and reliability.
* In presenting your views, your are expected to consider your own believability by telling your audience how confident you are. If you have doubts and you're not known as believable in the domain, you shouldn't have opinions in the first place; you're supposed to ask questions so you can learn. If you are expressing a fierce conviction, you should be forthright--but know your colleaguse will probe the quality of your reasoning. Even then, you're supposed to be assertive and open-minded at the same time.
* Even if your organization doesn't currently embrace critical upward feedback, holding an open season on leaders might be an effective way to begin changing the culture. By role modeling receptivity, employees across the company may become more willing to challenge leaders and one another.
* One can collect anonymous feedback, focus on constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, and email the full verbatim set to those who participated. Then follow up by summarizing what you felt were key suggestions, solicit feedback on interpretation, and propose changes to address the issues.
* Employees can also be encouraged to challenge others (including senior leaders) by being encouraged from early in training to question the principles.
* By the time employees are up to speek, they are already beginning to see the world the way the company does. The early period is a perfect time for employees to pay attention to opportunities to improve the culture. One possibility for this is to hold entry interviews.
* No one has a right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up about it.
* One of the main purposes for values is to help people between conflicting options, so they should be prioritized. (via Shalom Schwartz)
* Bridgewater uses discussion and debate to seek consensus, but they might be better served by randomized, controlled experiments. The quality of evidence there is the gold standard, whereas opinion of respected authorities is the least rigorous evidence.
* "Shapers" are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. They act in the face of risk, because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their feel of failing. The greatest shapers don't stop at introducing originality to the world. They create cultures that onleash originality in others.

## Managing Anxiety, Apathy, Ambivalence, and Anger
