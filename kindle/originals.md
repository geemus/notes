# Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World

* Successful originals begin by questioning defaults and then balance risk portfolios.
* Instead of accepting defaults, you take initiative to seek out options that might be better. When you encounter something you don't like, you fix it. Having taking initiative to improve things, you have little reason to go elsewhere as you have created the job you want.
* People are motivated to rationalize the status quo, even if it is against their interests. "People who suffer the most from a given state of affairs are paradoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or change it." - Jost and colleagues.
* Start with curiosity. Why does the default exist? Recognizing that most have social origins (they were created by people) gives us the courage to contemplate how they can be changed.
* Creative kids are least likely to become teacher's pets.
* Valueing achievement highly can crowd out originality, as you come to dread failure.
* Advocating for new systems often requires demolishing old ways, and we may hold back for fear of rocking the boat.
* Originality doesn't require extreme risk taking, originals are far more ordinary than we realize.
* Manage a risk portfolio. When we embrace danger in one domain, we offset overall risk by exercising caution in another. Having more security in one realm gives us freedom in another.
* Googlers who were randomly assigned to think of their jobs as malleable were happier and more performant. Having considered how their jobs could be modified, they took actiosn to improve them. By deviating from defaults they also qualified themselves for roles that were a better fit. Many realized their limits were of their own making.
* Originals aren't different than the rest of us. They have the same fears and doubts. What sets them apart is that they take action anyway, knowing that they would regret failing less than they would regret not trying.

## Recognizing Original Ideas

* Overconfidence may be particularly difficult to overcome in creative domains. New ideas are by definition unique, so previous feedback may not apply.
* To maximize odds of creating something truly great, create a large number of ideas. More prolific people are more original and have the most original output during their most prolific periods.
* The best way to get better at judging ideas is to gather feedback.
* Managers tend to be too risk averse, focusing on costs of bad ideas rather than benefits of good ones, leading to many false negatives.
* The more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world (Erik Dane research).
* Focus groups tend to be set up in a way that makes the same mistakes as managers (Justin Berg research).
* Fellow creators (colleagues) tend to be the best evaluators and givers of feedback.
* Spending just six minutes developing original ideas made people more open to novelty.
* Those with moderate expertise in a particular domain are most open to radically creative ideas.
* We can gain breadth by widening our cultural repertoire.
* Our intuitions are only accurate in domains where we have a lot of experience (Erik Dane research). Non-experts make sounder judgements through thorough analysis.
* The more successful people have been in the past, the worse they perform when entering a new environment. Overconfidence makes it less likely that critical feedback will be sought, even though the context is radically different.
* When assessing the prospects of a novel idea, it's all too easy to be seduced by the enthusiasm of the people behind it.
* If we want to improve idea selection, we shouldn't look at whether people have been successful. We should look at how they've been successful.
* Instead of limiting idea generation/selection to managers, Warby Parker makes this process completely transparent in a shared document. Everyone in the company can read, comment, and discuss in a biweekly meeting.

## Speaking Truth to Power

* Leaders and managers appreciate iniative when offering to help, building networks, gathering knowledge, and seeking feedback. But speaking up with suggestions can get penalized.
* Need to teas apart two dimensions of social heriarchy: power (exercising control and authority over others) and status (being respected and admired).
* By gaining respect we can also gain what psychologist Edwin Hollander called idiosyncracy credits - latitude to deviate from expectations. These accrue through respect, not rank, and are based on contributions.
* When pitching a novel idea or speaking up with a suggestion for a change, your audience is likely to be skeptical. There are at least four reasons to adopt Griscom's strategy of accentuating the flaws of your idea:
  * Leading with weaknesses disarms the audience. Marketing professors Marian Friestad and Peter Wright find that when we feel that someone is trying to persuade us, we raise our mental shields.
  * It makes you look smart, in that you have done your homework and anticipated problems that would be spotted. People think amateurs can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.
  * Being up front about downsides makes you appear more trustworthy.
  * It leaves the audience with a more favorable assessment of the idea, due to a bias in how we process information. Namely as psychologist Norbert Schwarz has shown, the easier it is to think of something, the more common and important we assume it is (we use ease of retrieval as a signal). By acknowledging serious problems, it makes it harder to think of new problems/critiques.
* If we want people to accept original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat. Professor John Kotter found that change agents typically undercommunicated their visions by a factor of ten.
* Psychologist Robert Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it. Again this may relate to ease of processing. Liking appears to increase as people are exposed to an idea between ten and twenty times, with additional exposure still useful with more complex ideas. Exposures are more effective when short and mixed with other ideas to maintain curiosity. It's also best to introduce delay between presentation and evaluation to let things sink in.
* It's impossible for us to imagine what it's like to listen for the first time because we are already too familiar with our ideas.
* Buliding on economist Albert Hirshman's writings, there are four ways to handle a dissatisfying situation: exit, voice, persistence, and neglect.
* Only when you believe your actions matter and care deeply will you consider speaking up.
* Our sense of commitment and control at work depends more on our direct boss than anyone else.
* As much as agreeable people may love us, they often hate conflict even more. The desire to please others and preserve harmony makes them prone to backing down instead of sticking up for us.
* When we decide to speak up, choosing our audience matters as much as how we deliver the message.
* When managers have a track record of challenging the status quo, they tend to be more open to new ideas and less threatened by contributions of others.
* It may be more effective to voice ideas upward and downward, and spend less time attempting to make suggestions to middle managers. Relates to sociologist George Homon note that middle-status conservatism reflects the anxiety experienced by one who aspires to a social station but fears disenfranchisement.
* Extensive research shows that when women speak up on behalf of others, they avoid backlash, because they're being communal.

## Timing, Strategic Procrastination, and the First-Mover Disadvantage

* Putting off a task buys you time to engage in divergent thinking, rather than foreclosing on one particular idea. (via Shin)
* People have better memory for incomplete than complete tasks. Once finished we stop thinking about it, but when interrupted and left undone, it stays active in our mind. (via Bluma Zeigarnik)
* Procrastinating also keeps us open to improvisation. When we plan in advance, we often stick to the structure we've created, closing the door to creative possibilities that  might spring into view.
* Great originals are great procrastinators, but they don't skip planning altogether. They procrastinate strategically, making gradual progress by testing and refining different possibilities.
* The first-mover advantage is truly in particular industries but is not supported by the research in the general case. First-mover advantage tends to prevail when patented technology is involved, or when there are strong network effects. (via Lisa Bolton)
* Being original doesn't require being first, just being different and better.
* First, when originals rush to be pioneers, they're prone to overstep. When a market is more defined, settlers enter and can focus on superior quality instead of deliberating what to offer in the first place.
* Second, people who choose to be late movers may be better suited to succeed as they balance their risk portfolios and wait for the right opportunity before entering.
* Third, along with being less recklessly ambitious, settlers can improve upon competitors' tech to make products better.
* Fourth, pioneers tend to get stuck in their early offerings, settlers can observe market changes and shifting consumer tastes and adjust.
* As Max Planck observed, "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die."
* When a market is uncertain, unknown, or underdeveloped, benig a pioneer has pronounced disadvantages.
* Just as procrastinating can give task flexibility, delaying market entry can open us to learning and adaptability, and reduce risks asseciated with originality.
* Two styles of innovation. Conceptual innovators are sprinters, formulating big ideas and setting out to execute them. Experimental innovaters are marathoners, solving problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go. (via Galenson)
* To sustain originality as we age and accumulate expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach. We can make fewer plans in advance and test out tentative ideas and solutions. With enough patience we may stumble upon something novel and useful.

## Creating and Maintaining Coalitions

* Even though they share a fundamental objective, radical groups often disparage more mainstream groups as imposters and sellouts, a concept known as horizontal hostility (via Judith White).
* In seeking alliances with groups that share our values, we overlook the importance of sharing our strategic tactics. Even if they care about different causes, groups find affinity when they use the same methods of engagement.
* Simon Sink argues if we want to inspire, we should start with why. If we communicate the vision behind our ideas, and purpose guiding our products, people will flock to us. When you are communicating something that challenges the status quo, though, you have to be careful about how you communicate your why.
* To succeed, originals often must become tempered radicals (via Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully). Shifting from why to how can help people become less radical.
* By opening with moderate asks instead of radical ones, what Robert Cialdini calls the foot-in-the-door technique, you can gain allies.
* Coalitions often fall apart when people refuse to moderate their radicalism.
* Movements need to draw in more casual participants if they are to succeed.
* Insiders and outsiders have distinct ideas about who represents a coalition (via Blake Ashforth and Peter Reingen). For insiders, the key representitive is whomever is most central and connected. For outsiders, the key representative is the person with the most extreme views.
* Enemies make better allies than frenemies. We need to tease apart how positive and how negative a relationship is. Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative relationships (via Bert Uchino). Intuition suggests we should sever bad relationships and salvage ambivalent ones, but evidence suggests the opposite: cut out frenemies and attempt to convert enemies.
* Experiments suggest that we're often more sensitive to gains and losses in esteem than the level of esteem itself (via Elliot Aronson).
* If we convert enemies, avoiding cognitive dissonance will motivate them to maint a positive relationship.
* Our former adversaries are often the most effective a persuading others to join. They can marshall better arguments because they understand the doubts and misgivings, making them a more credible source.
* Our starting point in generating ideas shapes the path, constraining what we imagine.
* To come up with something original, we need to begin from a more unfamiliar place. But more novel starting points don't necessarily make them palatable and practical to our audiences. The most promising ideas begin with novelty then add familiarity, capitalizing on the mere exposure effect.
* Conflicts between two groups are often caused and intensified by conflicts within the group (via Herbert Kelman). To build coalitions you need doves in each group to sit down, listen to each other's perspectives, identify common goals/methods, and engage in join problem solving.
