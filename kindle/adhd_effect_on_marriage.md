## Rebuilding Your Relationship in Six Steps

### Cultivating Empathy for Your Spouse

* ADHD people often feel:
  * Different - brain is often racing, which can be hard for others to understand or relate to.
  * Overwhelmed - keeping daily life under control takes more work than others realize.
  * Subordinate - others may spend a good deal of time correcting them or running the show.
  * Shamed - often hidden with bluster or retreat.
  * Unloved and unwanted - consistent reminders from others that they should "change" reinforces this.
  * Afraid to fail again, unsure if hard work will lead to good outcomes.
  * Longing to be accepted - in spite of imperfections
  * Relieved - when treatment helps and they can start taking control of their lives again.
* ADHD people may avoid treatment because it could be difficult or they might fail.
* Top things which lead to partners feeling unloved:
  * Failing to remember what the other has said.
  * Talking without thinking.
  * Zoning out of conversatiosn.
  * Having trouble dealing with frustration.
  * Having trouble starting a task.
  * Underestimating time needed to complete a task.
  * Leaving a mess.
  * Failing to finish household projects.
* ADHD different ways of thinking, creativity, energy, and joy can be appealing in their own right.
* Talk with your ADHD spouse and learn to understand what it feels like and how you might proceed in ways that communicate your love and needs in more satisfying ways.

  * Scared - may fear that distractedness my lead to harm for children or oneself, and/or that life will continue along current difficult path
  * Exhausted and depleted - carrying too many responsibilities, and no effort seems to fix the relationship.
  * Frustrated - may feel like the same issues keep coming back over and over.
  * Hopeless and sad - dreams put aside and grief over difficult of daily life.
* One of the reasons non-ADHD partners suffer is that they have very little control over what is happening to them.

### Addressing Obstacle Emotions

* Fear of Failure can Paralyze, try to make sure that you acknowledge failure as part of the experimentation needed to move forward.
* Inevitability of Anger in ADHD Relationships - if we assume responsibility for other's feelings/reactions, reliquish responsibility for our owngrowth andquality of life, or behave as if having a relationship is more important than having a self. Try to focus not on whathas come before, but what you can do together today and tomorrow.

  * Take a firm, but loving stand.
  * ADHD spouse needs to learn to clarify and express needs, including the need to bevalued and respected by one's spouse.
  * Don't let triggers send you back to the bad old days.

### Treatment Options

* Three specific parts to treatment: physical changes, behavioral changes, and developing strategies for interaction.

    * Insist on direction, structure and guidlines for the couple.
    * Don't stay with a therapist who repeatedly beats up on one partner, or whom you don't like.
    * Be wary of counselors eager to pass judgement or undermine.

### Improving Communication

* Learning conversation provides structure to give insight into ideas or needs.
  * One partner speaks a bit, roughly a pragraph.
  * Other partner repeats what they they they heard.
  * If they are right, it is their turn to speak. Otherwise, the first partner elaborates and then they try to mirror again. Repeat until they get it right.
  * When you have covered the topic, reverse roles.
* Tips for learning conversations.
  * Keep statements short and direct.
  * Don't just parrot back, think about statements enough to verbalize them in a new way.
  * Try to reflect subtleties, you are looking for depth of understanding, not superficial rephrasing of your words.
  * Don't interrupt the speaker.
  * Don't rebut until understanding has been established.
  * Respect your partner's right to hold an opinion, even if you don't agree.
  * The goal is to share your thinking, not defend a position.
  * It may help the ADHD spouse to write quick notes about discussions to remind them later.
* Importance of Validation
  * Learning conversations can give you a-ha moments about your spouse's life.
  * When conflict arises you can de-escalate, match, or escalate. Invalidating ideas is a surefire way to escalate.
  * Validation is about expressing you understand your partner's logic, evin if you don't agree, and that each of you has the right to old an opinion.
* Core Concerns that underlie many emotions and negotiations:
  * Appreciation - Whether or not your thoughts, feelings, and actions are acknowledged as having merit
  * Affiliation - are you an adversary or colleague
  * Autonomy - freedom to make your own decisions
  * Status - whether your relative standing is treated as inferior to others
  * Role - whether or not your current role and its activities are personally fulfilling
* In the midst of argument it can be hard to keep track of all of these. Focus on appreciation.
* When negotiating, focus on autonomy, or who is responsible for deciding what. Consider ACBD - Always Consult Before Deciding.
* Tips for Creating a Safe Communication Environment
  * Say no to all nagging and bullying
  * Reinforce positives
  * Reinforce connections by scheduling time together where the only goal is to pay attention to each other.
  * Put strengthening your connection first, getting things done second.
  * Respect need for space without giving up underlying connections.
  * Organize conversations so that you have specific times when hard topics will be discussed.
  * Set aside time just to have fun and connect.
  * Set priorities and determine when a topic is important enough to pursue right away.
  * Make it okay to not "solve" all problems.
  * Say thank you.
* Tips for Avoiding Triggering Shame and Fear in Conversations
  * Isolate difficult conversations.
  * Be aware.
  * In addition to ADHD/distraction, there may be gender issues at work.
  * Listen. Many women like to "talk things out" at least some times.
  * Resist problem solving
* Convesation issues related to ADHD symptoms
  * Blurting things out
  * Conversations that go everywhere
  * Love of arguing or inability to argue
  * Extreme defensiveness
  * Poor Memory of Agreements or Incidents
* Tips for Improving Communication
  * Think relationship, not marriage.
  * Protect your unique identities.
  * Practice validation.
  * Be wary of ongoing imbalances of conversational control.
  * Remember to take share and fear of failure nito account.
  * Don't assume you know your partner's motivations or assumptions.

  * Practice negotiating using the five core concerns
  * Manage impulsiveness and distraction, as these two ADHD traits frequently intrude on satisfying communication.
  * Use lots of learning conversations.
  * Strive to create a safe environment for airing opinions and ideas.
  * Listen. The response is as important as the initial salvo.

### Setting Boundaries and Finding Your Own Voice

* Forcing yourself or your habits on a spouse without consent ignores personal boundaries, which can unfortunately become the norm in an ADHD-affected relationship.
* Stop trying to change your spouse, and focus on what you can change and control by setting your own personal boundaries.
* Well defined boundaries allow you to put smaller issues in perspective and let go in many instances.
* Boundaries: elucidate morals or priorities, let others understand expectations, and allow for adaptations in how you interact with others.
* Ask: Where do you want to be in the future?
* Take care to separate real boundaries from wish list items, and make sure they are ideas within your control.

### Reigniting Romance and Having Fun

* Just spending time together doesn't impact how members feel. Doing new and exciting things together has a quick, direct, positive impact on mutual feelings.
* Anything both challenging and unusual for the couple improved feelings.
* Some studies suggest celebrating other's successes is more powerful in improving relationships than showing support for those in trouble.
* Tips:
  * Allow yourselves to be silly.
  * Use the opportunity to explore new things together.
  * Take up a spouse's favorite sport.
  * Travel.
  * Stay active.
  * Exercise and activity will put everyone in a better mood, and may help ADHD spouse focus.
  * Try something really creative together.
  * Take the opportunity to make new friends.
  * Get a babysitter - often!
  * Remember to laugh.
  * Revel in spontaneity.
  * Remind each other of your fun times together.
  * Keep sex life varied to help ADHD partner remain interested.
  * Distraction doesn't mean lack of attraction.
  * Find ways to show each other you care.
* If the ADHD spouse focuses on only one thing to improve the relationship once symptoms are under better control, focus on paying attention to your spouse.
* Romantic love is an ongoing series of gifts given simply because you want to give, focus on:
  * Connection - anything that builds friendship and has opportunity for fun back and forth, as well as activities that improve knowledge of positive attributes
  * Rejuvenation - trips, massages, exercises, creative immersion, and working for a cause can all rejuvenate.
  * Being heard - sometimes its important to do what your partner is wild about, even if you aren't.
  * Feeling beloved - the most romantic thing you can do is make someone feel loved and important in your life.
* Trust takes time.
* Don't try to fix the past, validate and accept it for the benefit it provides today.
* Noone is perfect, but we can consistently try to nurture a happy life together.

### Don't Try Harder, Try Differently

* Critical Points:
  * Get treatment.
  * Remember you are not the same.

# The ADHD Effect on Marriage: Understand and Rebuild Your Relationship in Six Steps by Melissa Orlov and Edward M. Hallowell
- Dr. John Ratey, an expert on how the brain functions, suggests that ADHD is the result of dysregulation of the reward system (primarily dopamine) in the brain. In short, the brain of a person with ADHD does not move dopamine and other chemicals in the attention areas of the brain in the same way that the brain of someone without ADHD does. (10)
- Drs. Russell Barkley, Kevin Murphy, and Mariellen Fischer have studied how to appropriately translate the current child-centered criteria for diagnosing ADHD to adults. (11)
- They have concluded that four criteria can diagnose the inattentive side of adult ADHD with 95 percent accuracy or better. (11)
- Fails to pay close attention to details Has difficulty organizing tasks Loses things necessary for tasks Is easily distracted (11)
- On the hyperactivity side of ADHD, they suggest that adult patients can be diagnosed accurately about 90 percent of the time with these criteria: (12)
- Feels restless Has difficulty engaging in leisure quietly Talks excessively Has difficulty awaiting turn (12)
- Dr. John Ratey, a leading expert in both ADHD and the brain, suggests that ADHD can be thought of as a reward-deficiency syndrome created from a deficit of specific pleasure neurotransmitters (most importantly dopamine, but also serotonin and endorphins) that are used to indicate reward in the attention centers of the brain. He notes that without these chemical indicators of reward, people with ADHD have trouble completing tasks that reward only after a long period, such as doing well in college to obtain a better job. (13)
- For a longer discussion about whether to take medication, as well as an overview of alternative treatment options, I suggest that you consult Hallowell and Ratey’s Delivered from Distraction. (14)
- Dr. Ned Hallowell compares living with ADHD to driving in the rain with bad windshield wipers at about 90 miles per hour. Every once in a while, things are very clear, but most of the time you’re not completely sure what’s coming at you—and it’s coming fast! (19)
- The ADHD brain has few filters on it; often, everything enters at once, and in a big jumble. (19)
- Living with ADHD is somewhat like having a race-car brain that lacks good brakes. Impulse control is a huge issue; people with ADHD often have minds that go fast and have trouble stopping when they need to. (21)
- The joke is that there are really only two time zones for a person with ADHD: “now” and “not now”! A person with ADHD is very present focused. (22)
- Though not true in all cases, people with ADHD often have trouble planning ahead. Planning means organizing a number of different options into a workable game plan and anticipating what will happen in various scenarios. (24)
- One of the major differences between how people with and without ADHD lead their lives has to do with how they experience time. This is more than just a symptom or two. People with ADHD are notoriously late because they can lose track of time, and they are often terrible judges of how long it will take them to complete a task. (24)
- When I hear or read a string of related ideas, my brain immediately “filters” them into a hierarchy. (26)
- The ADHD brain receives information quite differently. Instead of being hierarchical, I like to think of it as “flat.” Everything, important or not, initially receives about the same amount of attention. (26)
- It is unfortunate that one of the recurring experiences for individuals with ADHD is personal criticism or comments about how they just did something stupid. (27)
- Unfinished projects (distraction), poor decision making (impulsivity or too much information to process), memory problems, and more mean that people with ADHD often fail to do things as quickly as or in the same way that those without ADHD do them. (27)
- Pattern 1 Painful Misinterpretations of ADHD Symptoms and Motives (31)
- One of the most common misinterpretations is feeling as if an ADHD spouse doesn’t love his partner anymore because he isn’t paying attention to her. (31)
- One of the defining symptoms of ADHD is distraction. (32)
- Although his wife was at that very moment wallowing in despair over his treatment of her, he perceived things to be fine between them. This isn’t because he is dense; it’s just that after a lifetime of having people mad at or disappointed with him, Dan weathers periods of anger and criticism by mostly ignoring them. And, because people with ADHD don’t receive and process information in a hierarchical way, Maria’s suffering enters his mind at about the same level as everything else he perceives— (32)
- Tips Avoiding Misinterpretations of ADHD Symptoms and Motives (33)
- Assume you don’t know your spouse’s motives. If something makes you feel bad, ask questions so you can better understand the underlying motives. (33)
- Put measurements in place to differentiate between actions and words. (33)
- Consider weekly “learning conversations” (explained in detail in Step 4) to address issues that simply won’t go away. Make it a point to discuss your motives and differences in approach that might be getting in the way of finding common ground. (33)
- Learn to laugh when you miscommunicate, rather than see it as a sign that you’ll never figure it out. (33)
- Pattern 2 The Destructive Symptom-Response-Response Cycle (34)
- The destruction comes from a full pattern, though—one that includes the symptoms, the response to these symptoms, and then the response to that response. (34)
- Tips Avoiding Symptom-Response-Response (35)
- Always consider the symptom and the response. (35)
- Don’t let the presence of negative responses turn into an excuse not to manage ADHD symptoms. (35)
- Learn which responses produce positive outcomes. (35)
- Pattern 3 The Hyperfocus Courtship (35)
- It is quite typical that a person with ADHD is so involved in and excited by courtship that he becomes hyperfocused on his partner. (35)
- He wasn’t a different person—he was still sweet, thoughtful (when he thought of me, which wasn’t often), smart…he just wasn’t paying any attention. (38)
- Accept that ADHD is a factor, then push it aside by consciously and unabashedly making time for romance a top priority. (38)
- Tips Dealing with Hyperfocus Courtship Shock (39)
- Remember that it’s not personal. (39)
- Improve connections. Feeling ignored is still painful. Address the issue head-on by establishing ways to improve your connections and intimacy. (39)
- Allow yourself to mourn for the pain the ADHD hyperfocus shock has caused you both. (39)
- Pattern 4 The Parent–Child Dynamic (40)
- The most common and most destructive of all of the patterns I will describe is the parent–child dynamic, where one spouse is almost always responsible and the other rarely is. (40)
- Taking care of kids is so time intensive that it puts extra emphasis and importance on staying organized and “getting things done” and can exacerbate parent–child pattern issues. (41)
- Tips Avoiding the Parent–Child Dynamic for the Non-ADHD Spouse (48)
- Take control of your own actions, and stop all verbal abuse immediately. (48)
- Don’t nag! (48)
- Keep searching for alternatives. Use family meetings to organize and discuss your issues with less distraction; consult with a marriage therapist; schedule dates to connect. (48)
- Recognize that you can never successfully “parent” a spouse, even though it’s possible to successfully help a child with ADHD. (48)
- Remember that parenting a spouse kills the romance and warm feelings critical to a successful marriage. (48)
- Applaud all forward progress. (48)
- Research shows that encouragement, support, and recognition of success are far more effective than offering “help” when your goal is to inspire continued success. (48)
- Understand that offers of “help” can be misconstrued in adult parent–child relationships. They may say, “You’re not competent enough to do this alone.” Try to offer partnership: that is, participate in creating solutions that work for you both rather than “fix” something your spouse isn’t doing right. (49)
- Develop verbal cues. Arrange with your spouse a method for pointing out and talking about parent–child interactions as they happen, so you can start to identify them. (49)
- Keep your marriage at the top of your list. (49)
- Consider hiring professional help. (49)
- Tips Avoiding the Parent–Child Dynamic for the ADHD Spouse (49)
- If you are being parented, it means that ADHD symptoms are getting in the way of your relationship, whether you are aware of it or not. (50)
- Talk with your doctor about improving treatment. You may wish to change medication dosage or timing, undertake a regular exercise routine, add fish oil, do brain training, or adopt behavioral changes through cognitive behavioral therapy, ADHD coaching, or another approach. (50)
- Start with something symbolic. Take full ownership of a project or task that is meaningful to your non-ADHD spouse. (50)
- Determine what you are not good at and establish a plan for getting it done by someone else. (50)
- Start a regular exercise program (50)
- (Note: The focus benefit of exercise lasts for a few hours, so thinking about when you exercise can help you use this tool to its best advantage.) (50)
- Agree to verbal cues to point out parent–child interactions as they happen. (51)
- Pattern 5 The Chore Wars (51)
- Treatment helps people with ADHD focus and makes it easier to create reminder systems, initiate new tasks, and stay with something even if it is boring. (51)
- Non-ADHD spouses who find themselves in this situation often add to their problems by personally taking on too many of the chores that are cast aside early in their relationship. It’s generally more efficient to do this but it hurts the relationship in the long run. (54)
- Tips Getting Around the Chore Wars (55)
- Constant nagging is a warning indicator that ADHD is hurting your marriage—a lot. (55)
- Quit nagging, cold turkey. (55)
- Measure the extent of your problem using the Chore Score Worksheet in the Worksheets and Tools section at the back of this book. (55)
- Think treatment. At the heart of most chore wars is at least one ADHD symptom. It might be distraction, inability to initiate, inability to complete tasks, or something else. Figure out which one (or more) it is, and treat it. (55)
- Get on the same page when it comes to who does what and when. (55)
- Don’t overcompensate for a spouse’s untreated ADHD. (55)
- Think in terms of “well enough.” Most chores don’t have to be done to perfection; “well enough” will do. (56)
- Pattern 6 The Blame Game (56)
- With parent–child dynamics in place and/or chore wars exhausting them, both spouses become mired in resentment and anger. (56)
- She blames him for their misery. He blames her for ruining their relationship with her anger or coldness. (57)
- I personally think the word blame should be banned in the realm of marriage. (57)
- What’s the best way out of the blame game? To decide to stop playing it. (58)
- Tips Getting Out of the Blame Game (59)
- Look inward. (59)
- Openly accepting your own responsibility and accepting the validity of the other spouse’s complaints (even if you don’t understand their underpinnings) can quickly take some of the pressure off. (59)
- Don’t equate good intentions with good outcomes. Actions are important, and if one spouse says either’s actions are inadequate, they likely are, regardless of the intent. (59)
- Differentiate each spouse from his or her symptoms. (59)
- When you do this you make room for yourselves to “attack” the problem together without attacking an individual and putting that person on the defensive. (59)
- Work with a counselor who knows ADHD. (59)
- Pattern 7 Walking on Eggshells, Anger Spurts, and Rude Behavior (60)
- These tantrums, spurts of anger, and rude behaviors often accompany ADHD and have to do with lack of impulse control. (60)
- It’s less obvious, but no less true, that the anger a non-ADHD spouse expresses is also often a symptom of having ADHD in your relationship. (60)
- Pattern 8 Pursuit and Escape (60)
- To address this spiral, this husband could acknowledge that his ADHD symptoms are causing problems for his wife, and treat them effectively in order to change the pattern. (63)
- him change his behaviors around the home. He’s “in control” here because he’s the one with the symptoms, no matter how hard she tries. (63)
- She could take some of the “pursuer” pressure off her spouse by choosing to assist him in a very few well-defined areas that are particularly important to her own well-being. (63)
- Tips Dealing with Pursuit and Escape (64)
- Aggressive pursuit, even when offered as “help,” can paralyze an ADHD partner, who may well see it as one of a long series of comments on his or her competence. (64)
- Pursuit often signals desperation. (64)
- Pattern 9 Nag Now, Pay Later (64)
- Nagging puts your entire relationship at risk by changing the proportion of positive interactions to negative interactions heavily in favor of the negative. (65)
- The most important reason not to nag is that it’s completely and totally ineffective over the long term. (65)
- Tips Stop Nagging (66)
- Just say “no.” Nagging is a choice. (66)
- Agree to specific language to point out nagging as it happens. (66)
- Treat the underlying ADHD symptoms (66)
- Pattern 10 Losing Faith in Your Spouse and Yourself (66)
- Tips Not Losing Faith (70)
- Blame the ADHD symptoms, not yourself. (70)
- Think about who you want to be in your life. Many of the choices we make day to day are just that—choices. (70)
- Get support. (70)
- Pattern 11 Your Sexual Relationship Breaks Down (71)
- Tips Handling It When Sex Becomes a Problem (72)
- Don’t force it. (72)
- Build intimacy in other ways. (72)
- Schedule intimate time. (72)
- Consider medication or exercise. (72)
- Get counseling for pornography or sex addictions. (72)
- Pattern 12 Believing ADHD Doesn’t Matter (73)
- There’s no downside to seeing what a well thought out treatment might do for your relationship, but there is a potentially huge upside. (73)
- If you have ADHD, I guarantee that you underestimate the impact your ADHD has on your non-ADHD spouse. (82)
- Yes, she may be more efficient, but that is not the only dimension of a relationship; in fact, I would argue that in the long run it is a relatively unimportant dimension of a relationship, except when you are both working and have small children relying on you. (82)
- a person with ADHD often experiences the following feelings: (84)
- Different. The brain is often racing, and people with ADHD experience the world in a way that others don’t easily understand or relate to. (84)
- Overwhelmed, secretly or overtly. Keeping daily life under control takes much more work than others realize. (84)
- Subordinate to their spouses. Their partners spend a good deal of time correcting them or running the show. (84)
- Shamed. They often hide a large amount of shame, sometimes compensating with bluster or retreat. (84)
- Unloved and unwanted. Consistent reminders from spouses, bosses, and others that they should “change” reinforce that they are unloved as they are. (84)
- Afraid to fail again. (85)
- Longing to be accepted. One of the strongest emotional desires of those with ADHD is to be loved as they are, in spite of imperfections. (85)
- Relieved. When treatment helps and they can start to take control of their lives again, few want to “go back.” (85)
- Hidden shame and fear of failure plague most who have suffered long periods of undiagnosed ADHD. (86)
- Imagine the stress of living your life knowing that you could never be confident that hard work would result in a good outcome! (89)
- The logical choice, if you are used to being successful when you attempt something difficult, would be to address the symptoms and change your future for the better. But in the untreated ADHD life, one “logical” choice might be to not try and therefore not risk failure. (89)
- One common non-ADHD partner theme is “If my partner would just change….” Yet a change in habits is most likely to happen when a person feels loved and safe within a relationship, just the opposite of the message that much of the daily communication between you sends. (91)
- Top Marital Issues That Both Partners Agree Lead to Feeling Unloved10 Failing to remember what the other has said Talking without thinking Zoning out of conversations Having trouble dealing with frustration Having trouble getting started on a task Underestimating time needed to complete a task Leaving a mess Failing to finish household projects (91)
- I would argue that ADHD was a big part of why we found our spouses attractive in the first place. A non-hierarchical ADHD brain can see things in new ways, which can in turn inspire creativity and entrepreneurship. The energy, spontaneity and joy with which many who have ADHD live their lives can be contagious. (93)
- The ADHD ability to move beyond adversity can also be a real gift. (94)
- Talk with your ADHD spouse. Ask him or her what ADHD feels like. You may well be surprised to learn about hidden shame or anxieties, feeling overwhelmed, or the embarrassment of being constantly criticized. Your conversations about these things might help you to proceed in a way that communicates your love and your needs in a way that’s more satisfying to you both. (99)
- The impact of ADHD symptoms is new to the non-ADHD spouse, which means that he or she associates these difficult new experiences with you as a person, since they started when you entered his or her life. (101)
- the non-ADHD spouse often experiences the following feelings: (101)
- Lonely. The ADHD spouse is too distracted to pay attention. (101)
- Unwanted or unloved. The lack of attention is interpreted as lack of interest rather than distraction. (101)
- Angry and emotionally blocked. (102)
- Incredibly stressed out. Non-ADHD spouses often carry the vast proportion of the family responsibilities and can never let their guard down. (102)
- Ignored and offended. To a non-ADHD spouse, it doesn’t make sense that the ADHD spouse doesn’t act on the non-ADHD partner’s experience and advice more often when it’s “clear” what needs to be done. (102)
- Scared. The non-ADHD spouse tends to fear for the couple’s children, worrying that a distracted spouse will somehow hurt the kids; and for oneself, that life will continue along its current and difficult path. (102)
- Exhausted and depleted. The non-ADHD spouse carries too many responsibilities, and no amount of effort seems to fix the relationship. (102)
- Frustrated. A non-ADHD spouse might feel as if the same issues keep coming back over and over again (a sort of boomerang effect). (102)
- Hopeless and sad. Many dreams have been put aside, and a profound grief pervades the daily difficulties of life. (102)
- Thus the non-ADHD spouse can never relax. She learns to mistrust her spouse, because while his intentions are usually good, his untreated (or undertreated) ADHD gets in the way of his turning intention into action. (106)
- Always needing to be on alert, combined with being responsible for the majority of all of the chores and scutwork, results in exhaustion. (107)
- One of the reasons that non-ADHD partners suffer is that they have very little control over what is happening to them. (107)
- As frustration and anger build, non-ADHD spouses can start making less empathetic decisions, sometimes abdicating responsibility for helping a spouse in practical and easy ways while trying to push him in harder areas so he can “prove” his love. This serves the dual purpose of punishing him further and proving herself correct. (111)
- Effective treatment, used in the broadest sense of the word, can change the life of an ADHD spouse. It also radically changes the life of the non-ADHD partner. (116)
- You can know intellectually about your anger and know how different you are and still have trouble knowing what to do next. I’m going to ask you to step outside of yourselves—or perhaps dig deeper into yourselves, if you prefer to think of it this way—and ask that you BOTH step out of your current cycle. (117)
- Four particular emotions must be acknowledged early in the rebuilding process. I call them obstacle emotions, for if left unattended they block couples from being able to move in a positive direction. (118)
- Fear of Failure Can Paralyze (119)
- Often, in frustration, a non-ADHD partner points out every failure the ADHD spouse encounters and uses it as further proof of incompetence. A better way is to acknowledge failures as part of the experimentation needed to move forward. The former produces paralysis; the latter encourages experimentation. (119)
- The Inevitability of Anger in ADHD Relationships (119)
- Anger is inevitable when our lives consist of giving in and going along; when we assume responsibility for other people’s feelings and reactions; when we relinquish our primary responsibility to proceed with our own growth and ensure the quality of our own lives; when we behave as if having a relationship is more important than having a self. (120)
- What you have been doing is not working. You don’t need to try harder, you need to try differently. I’m going to suggest that you make a radical shift in your thinking and behavior. One good way to begin is to think in terms of creating a completely new relationship. Put the old relationship in a box and put it aside. Then, create a new relationship in which you and your spouse work together on “today” and “tomorrow.” (122)

- They revolve around the following principles: Respecting your individual needs and differences Taking responsibility for yourself, and only yourself Finding your own voice—that is, behaving in a way that is consistent with being the person you aspire to be and who is uniquely “you” Creating interactions and making choices that are “ADHD sensitive” (134)
- Tips Stepping Away from Anger (138)
- Be ready to mourn. (138)
- Differentiate feeling anger from venting. (139)
- Translate your anger into clear, nonblaming statements focused on underlying issues and validation. (139)
- Stop diagnosing your spouse’s ADHD. (140)
- Instead of focusing on “I think you have ADHD,” focus on the specific issues that you have in your relationship. (140)
- Take responsibility for your own anger and behavior, but don’t feel responsible for your partner’s. (141)
- Observe yourself carefully. (141)
- Declare autonomy without declaring war. (141)
- Take a firm but loving stand. (142)
- The ADHD spouse needs to learn how to clarify and express needs, including the need to be valued and respected by one’s spouse. (142)
- Don’t Let Triggers Send You Back to the Bad Old Days (143)
- refer you to Dr. Ned Hallowell and Dr. John Ratey’s Delivered from Distraction for an excellent overview of many of the options available to treat ADHD. (145)
- But the ADHD spouse needs to be aware that deciding not to treat ADHD is not a neutral act. By deciding not to address ADHD, a spouse decides that the status quo is fine. (147)
- In any marriage affected by ADHD, the non-ADHD spouse has very real issues that must be addressed for the marriage to break out of its negative patterns. (148)
- Optimal treatment for an adult with ADHD in a committed relationship has three specific parts, the first two of which are true for treating ADHD all of the time, and the third of which is specific to being in a successful relationship. (149)
- Leg 1: Making physical changes to your body. (149)
- Leg 2: Making behavioral (habit) changes. (149)
- Leg 3: Developing strategies to use when interacting with your spouse. (149)
- A non-ADHD spouse can contribute to ADHD treatment by keeping these things in mind: (153)
- Treatment of ADHD is the sole responsibility of the ADHD spouse. (153)
- Applaud all progress that both of you make. (153)
- It takes two partners to measure treatment success. (153)
- Developing verbal cues (154)
- Professional guidance can help. (154)
- Prioritizing issues and thinking through your joint goals for treatment can be a good time to seek outside help. (155)
- A good counselor will help you focus on today’s issues rather than on the past. (155)
- If the ADHD partner isn’t ready to commit to making substantial change, it may not be worth hiring a coach. (156)
- Tips Finding Professional Help (156)
- Look for someone who knows about ADHD (156)
- Insist that your therapist provide you as a couple with direction, structure and guidelines. (157)
- Don’t go along with a therapist who seems to repeatedly beat up on one partner, or a coach whom you don’t like. (157)
- Be wary of counselors eager to pass judgment or undermine your marriage. (157)
- Most important of all, look for a therapist comfortable working in the present. (158)
- A learning conversation is a structured conversation designed to give you insight into one or both partners’ ideas or needs. (166)
- The point of a learning conversation is not to “solve” a specific problem, but rather to understand the underlying reasons you are having trouble with an issue. (166)
- One spouse, let’s say a wife with ADHD, speaks for a short while--the equivalent of one paragraph. Then her husband repeats what he thinks he heard in his own words, without adding commentary. If he has it right, then it’s his turn to speak. If he hasn’t gotten it quite right, she elaborates to explain what he missed, and he mirrors it back until he fully understands what she said. Then it’s the husband’s turn. He speaks briefly in response to his wife’s original idea or question, and they reverse roles. (166)
- Keep your statements short and direct. Too much information slows down the process and risks losing the attention of your partner. (166)
- When you mirror, don’t just parrot back; think about the statement enough so that you can verbalize it in a new way. (166)
- As you listen to your partner mirror what you said, make sure his words reflect your thoughts in all their subtlety. You are looking for depth of understanding, not superficial rephrasing of your words. (166)
- Don’t interrupt the speaker. (166)
- Don’t rebut until it’s time to do so. (166)
- Show respect by validating your partner’s right to hold an opinion, even if you don’t agree with it, and remaining civil. If anger flares, call a timeout and try again later. (166)
- Remember that the point of using this technique is to share your thinking, not defend a position. (167)
- If you are an ADHD spouse with a poor memory, it will probably help you to get into the habit of writing quick notes about your findings or agreements in a journal and leave it someplace obvious like a bedside table. Every once in a while when you “happen upon it,” pick it up to remind yourself what you are currently working on. (169)
- The Importance of Validation (169)
- One of the reasons learning conversations work well is that they give you a chance to have some “a-ha” moments about your spouse’s life and your own motives. (169)
- When conflict arises, there are several ways you can respond: You can de-escalate the conflict, match the conflict, or escalate the conflict. A surefire way to escalate conflict is to invalidate your partner’s idea. (170)
- Validation isn’t about agreement, or about saying the “right” words to get a partner to calm down. It’s about expressing that you understand your partner’s logic, even if you don’t agree with it, and that each of you has the right to hold your own opinion. (170)
- The emotions that you are feeling in your relationship can be either obstacles or assets in your negotiations with your spouse, depending on whether those emotions are generally negative (obstacles) or positive (assets). (171)
- they suggest that you focus on some “core concerns” that underlie many human emotions and most of your marital negotiations. (171)
- Core Concerns The Concern is Ignored When… The Concern is Met When… Appreciation Your thoughts, feelings, or actions are devalued. Your thoughts, feelings, and actions are acknowledged as having merit. Affiliation You are treated as an adversary and kept at a distance. You are treated as a colleague. Autonomy Your freedom to make decisions is impinged upon. Others respect your freedom to decide important matters. Status Your relative standing is treated as inferior to that of others. Your standing where deserved is given full recognition. Role Your current role and its activities are not personally fulfilling. You so define your role and its activities that you find them fulfilling. (172)
- He pointed out that it’s hard to remember and think about five different areas, particularly in the heat of negotiation. So if you have to pick one in the middle of a conversation, he suggests that couples struggling with ADHD focus on appreciation: that is, understanding, finding merit in, and supporting your spouse’s point of view. (173)
- When not in the middle of a conversation, Shapiro suggests thinking about autonomy, or who is responsible for deciding what issues. (173)
- A simple way to avoid conflict around issues of autonomy might be to use a simple rule: ACBD—Always Consult Before Deciding. (173)
- Verbal cues are a great tool to use if you have repetitive conversations around sensitive topics that always seem to escalate or get off track. You know they are coming, but you don’t know how to stop them. Developing verbal cues together can change that. (174)
- Tips Creating a Safe Communication Environment (177)
- Say “no” to all nagging and bullying. (177)
- Reinforce positives. (177)
- Reinforce connection by scheduling time together when your only goal is to pay attention to each other. (177)
- Put strengthening your connections first, getting things done second. (177)
- Respect either partner’s need for space without giving up your underlying connections. (177)
- Organize your conversations so that you have specific times when hard topics will be discussed. (177)
- Set aside time just to have fun and connect. (178)
- Use verbal cues whenever necessary to redirect conversations before they become destructive. Strive to make ADHD as neutral as possible in your interactions—something to be dealt with and worked around, but not criminal or an indication that the partner is “broken.” (178)
- Set priorities to determine whether a topic is important enough to your well-being to pursue right then. (178)
- Make it okay to not “solve” all problems. (178)
- Say thank you. (178)
- Tips Avoid Triggering Shame and Fear in Conversations (181)
- Isolate difficult conversations. (181)
- Be aware. (182)
- It’s not just ADHD and distraction; there may also be a gender issue at work. (182)
- Listen. Most women do like to “talk things out” at least some of the time. (182)
- Resist problem solving. (182)

- logistics are critical in keeping a family from flying apart, particularly when you have young children in the household. But the heart of your success is the special relationship between you and your spouse. Everything is rooted in your connection. (184)
- Tips Improving Communication (184)
- Think relationship, not marriage. (184)
- Protect your unique identities. (184)
- Practice validation. (185)
- Be wary of ongoing imbalances of conversational control. (185)
- Remember to take shame and fear of failure into account. (185)
- Don’t assume you know your partner’s motivations or assumptions. (185)
- Be responsible only for yourself. (185)
- Practice negotiating using the five core concerns. (185)
- Manage impulsiveness and distraction, as they are two ADHD traits that frequently intrude on satisfying communication. (185)
- Use learning conversations—lots of them! (186)
- Strive to create a safe environment for airing opinions and ideas. (186)
- Listen. In interactions, the response is as important as the initial salvo. (186)
- Forcing yourself or your habits on a spouse without consent is what I call ignoring personal boundaries. (188)
- But in ADHD-affected relationships ignoring personal boundaries isn’t a sometimes thing; it can be a way of life. (188)
- There are only a few ways out of this dilemma, and the one that seems to work best is to stop doing things to change your spouse and start doing things to change yourself, guided by a well-thought-out set of reasons to behave a certain way. That is, you need to set personal boundaries. (188)
- Boundaries protect who you are at your most essential. When you live in a way that is consistent with your boundaries and above your lower threshold, then you are most likely to have a happy, healthy relationship. Conversely, if you must constantly suppress essential parts of yourself and live below important boundary thresholds, you feel empty, unfulfilled, and unhappy. (190)
- Well-defined boundaries allow you to put smaller issues into perspective and let go in many instances. (190)
- Boundaries serve three important purposes: They elucidate a set of morals or priorities. They allow others to clearly understand your expectations. Over time, the consistency of good boundaries allows for adaptations in how you interact with others. (190)
- Think about where your personal boundaries or rules used to be when you were happiest. (191)
- Think about where your boundaries, or personal rules, are today. (191)
- Ask your spouse questions: (191)
- Where do you want to be in the future? (191)
- Ideally, this means separating real boundaries from a wish list of things you would like to see change. (192)
- Does the idea point back to another person? (192)
- Test the concept against real-life situations for consistency. (192)
- Try the idea with others. (192)
- Does it make you a better person? (192)
- The difference between wish list items and true boundaries is that a wish list is what we would like, but a boundary is what we absolutely must have in order to live our life, in any situation, as the person we wish to be. (194)
- You’ve defined your personal boundaries by now, so what do you do with them? Create a plan for change, and act on it. (195)
- But most of all, you want to have fun and be in love again! (199)
- About feeling safe, and as if you’ve “come home” when you are with the person you love. (200)
- just spending time together doesn’t have any impact on how members of a couple feel about each other. However, doing something new and exciting together has a direct, positive impact on their mutual feelings, very quickly (the average activity in his research is around seven minutes long). (200)
- doing anything together that is both challenging and unusual for the couple helped improve their feelings. (201)
- Other studies suggest that celebrating each other’s successes is more powerful in improving relationships than showing support for those in trouble. (201)
- Tips Finding What Works in Love (202)
- Allow yourselves to be silly. (202)
- Use this as an opportunity to explore new things together. (203)
- Take up a spouse’s favorite sport. (203)
- Travel. (203)
- Stay active. (203)
- Exercise and activity will put you both in a better mood for physiological reasons, and you may well find that the ADHD spouse focuses better when active, too. (204)
- Try something really creative together. (204)
- Let the Internet fuel your dreams. (204)
- Take the opportunity to make new friends. (204)
- Get a babysitter—often! (204)
- Remember to laugh. (204)
- Revel in spontaneity. (205)
- Remind each other of your fun times together. (205)
- Keep your sex life varied to help the ADHD partner remain interested. (207)
- Distraction in the ADHD partner doesn’t mean a non-ADHD partner is unattractive. (207)
- Find ways to show each other you care. (207)
- Pornography use can be a form of self-medication (stimulates dopamine production in the brain), but it can ruin a couple’s sex life if it replaces regular sex or repulses the other partner. (207)
- Lower sex drive. Some research indicates that at least some people with ADHD experience less interest in sex, but the research does not delve into why. (207)
- Higher sex drive. On the other hand, some with ADHD find they need sex multiple times a day. (207)
- Parent–child dynamics will kill your sex life fast. So will nagging. (207)
- Ask your spouse if sex feels like a “chore.” (207)
- For those of you with ADHD: If you focus on only one thing that will improve your relationship once your symptoms are under better control, focus on paying attention to your spouse. (209)
- Romantic love is an ongoing series of gifts given simply because you want to give. (211)
- As you think about what “gifts” you can give, focus on: (211)
- Connection—any activity that builds your friendship and provides ample opportunity for fun back and forth, as well as any activity that improves your knowledge of each other’s positive attributes. (211)
- Rejuvenation—trips, massages, exercise, immersion in the creative (literature, music, art, cooking, etc.), and working for a cause all have the power to rejuvenate people. (211)
- Being heard—sometimes the most romantic thing you can do for someone is the thing you least want yourself, but your spouse is wild about. (211)
- Feeling beloved—the most romantic thing you can do for people is to make them feel loved and important in your life. (212)
- Trust takes time. (212)
- you must keep in mind that the objective isn’t to relive the past or to “fix” it, but to validate and accept it for the benefit that it provides today. (212)
- I also happen to like “trust but verify” as a way of reassuring yourself that a spouse who has had trouble being honest or has been terribly inconsistent is changing his or her ways. (213)
- In my mind, the best sort of trust comes from agreeing that no one is perfect but we can consistently try to nurture a happy life together. (214)
- We will work, every day, to strengthen our connections and make sure our lives are organized in a way that lets us bestow the gift of attention. (214)
- For easy reference, here are some of the critical points, in order of importance: (215)
- Get treatment. (215)
- Remember that you are not the same. (215)
- Understand your personal boundaries and stick to them. (215)
- Leave responsibility for ADHD symptom management with the ADHD spouse. (216)
- Don’t try harder, try differently. (216)
- Eradicate the blame game from your relationship. (216)
- Step out of the cycle of anger. (216)
- Reestablish connection. (216)
- Be aware of shame and fear. (216)
- Use the specific conversational techniques in this book. (218)
- Tackle the chore wars with the Recipe for Success system. (218)
- Give each other the gift of attention. (218)
- Have fun and laugh together. (218)
- Seek help from people who understand ADHD. (218)
- Remember that change takes time. (218)
- Applaud your progress! (218)
