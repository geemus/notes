# The Mindful Geek: Mindfulness Meditation for Secular Skeptics

## Overview

* Mindfulness meditation is paying attention to present-moment sensory experience in a nonjudgemental way. It isn't stopping thinking, emptying your mind, or feeling blissful.

* Focus is a trainable skill, and meditation systematically trains you to concentrate.
* Additional Benefits: Reduce stress, enhance empathy, freedom from automatic reactions, increase cognitivve flexibility, boost memory, reduce pain sensitivity, better brain, and prevent/reverse neurodegeneration
* Meditation can help get us in touch with good life/flourishing PERMA: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishments

* A good starting goal is 30 minutes a day, five days a week, but any amount helps (try for at least 10 minutes per day).
* Common Mistakes: thinking you are doing it wrong, becoming grossly distracted or fantisizing, falling asleep, trying too hard, stopping early, and changing technique within a session.
* Common Tips: Sit with your back upright to signal nervous system to be alert, otherwise don't worry too much about posture, try to be comfortable, and remain still to help your mind settle down.
* Tips for building habits: make a contract with yourself, make a calendar, create social pressure, sit with a group, make it hard to fail, work with a coach, and regularly list the goals and benifits.
* Tips for deeper sensory clarity: think about sensation as 3d instead of just 2d, recognize that sensations aren't always solid or stable, investigate body areas you normally don't, get curious on as fine a scale as you can, notice differences in textures of sensations, notice if sensations are moving or being still, etc.

* Core Concepts: concentration, sensory clarity, and acceptance (CCA)
* Concentration is being able to train your attention on whatever you choose and sustain it there. We develop it by brute force repetition.
* Sensory clarity is having a lot of resolution of details of your focus object. We develop it by trying to make ever finer distinctions.
* Acceptance is having an open, curious, non-judgemental attitude to whatever is happening. We develop it by just doing it.
* Acceptance is experienced in the body as physical relaxation and/or in the mind as lack of psychological resistance. Take advantage of this by alternating if one or the other is a struggle.
* A good meditation can result from having even a little of one of CCA, if you have two or three it will be quite good.

* Evolution has guided our nervous system to use pleasure and pain as guidance systems, but our context has changed and these signals may not always be as valuable.
* Benefits: it is hard to investigate things you are avoiding/suppressing/denying and these signals are just as behaviorally valuable as pleasurable ones, you can miss insights by avoiding this investigation, trying to avoid pain signals can make them feel worse.
* Our ability to imagine the future is a defining characteristic, but also leads to a state of constant stress which activates the hypothalamic-pituitarity-adrenal (HPA) system. Meditation can provide a counter by helping us to relax and giving us something to focus on other than future worries.

* Emotions rule our lives, mindfulness can give us more insight and clarity. We need both positive and negative signals to motivate and direct us. Mindfulness brings unconcious or semi-concious emotional experience into focus and awareness, improving emotional intelligence.
* Basic emotions: fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and joy.
* Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH) - Emotions may be orchestrated deep in the unconcious mind, but they are mainly embodied events
* If emotions are feeling overwhelming you can: focus on a neutral spot in the body, focus on something external, or pendulate (alternate between something neutral and the hotspot).

* Flow comes from tasks you like and can do, but that remains challenging. Training focus increases flow by reducing boredom when something is too easy or anxiety when something is too hard. We can practice this by choosing focus objects which are a bit too hard or boring for us.

* We can increase concentration in our lives by removing distractions.

* Mindful listening can deepen our engagement and the quality of our interactions.

* We tend to move through life relying on heuristics. Mindfulness allows us to bypass this and rediscover the details by building our sensory clarity. Getting into smaller and subtler dimensions of sensation is a powerful way to improve sensory clarity and continue progressing in meditation practice.

* When we are not focused, our thoughts are dominated by the default mode network (DMN), which is roughly the opposite of flow state. Mindfulness can down-regulate DMN through practicing open awareness. Mindfulness meditation can boost creativity by fostering effortlessness.

## Meta-Technique: Labeling

* Labeling helps focus attention and can increase the potency of mindfulness's beneficial effects (particularly when labeling affect)
* Tips: Be gentle/soothing, don't try too hard, you don't have to be right, it's not a mantra, slowly, optional, can be spoken aloud, and can renote or use multiple labels.

## Meta-Technique: General

1. Find a comfortable seat.
2. Sit up straight, extending your spine, and point your chin just slightly (~5 degrees) below horizontal.
3. Relax your entire body, taking three deep breaths, and letting them out slowly.
4. Perform the technique of your choice.
5. Repeat as desired.
6. Spend at least a minute sitting quietly and focusing on relaxed sensations before continuing with your day.

## Meta-Technique: Focus Algorithm

Focus on an object, label it, curiously examine it, accept it, do them all together, and repeat.

1. Notice the focus object
2. Label the focus object
3. Actively explore focus object with great curiosity and depth (make sure to feel at least one very specific sensation somewhere)
4. Feel acceptance toward whatever you find
5. Continue focusing, contacting, and accepting (all at once) for about 5 seconds

## Technique: Focus on Relaxation

Focus on relaxing and the sensations this generates.

* Relax your muscles in sequence, and focus on the sensations of them relaxing.
* Relax your entire body, and focus on the sensation of relaxation.

## Technique: Focus on Body Sensation

Scan for body sensations and curiously examine them.

* Tune into sensations in skin, muscle and bone in sequence throughout your body.
* For each sensation: where is it located, what size is it, what shape is it, what texture is it, etc

* Variation: focus specifically/only on breath sensation.

## Technique: Focus on Emotion

Scan for emotional sensations in the body and curiously examine them.

* For each ...: Feel gross sensations in muscles, skin, and flesh. Then feel subtler sensations. Then either pendulate back and forth, or try to contact both at once.

1. Scan through the body, looking for emotions or labeling none: face, throat, chest, belly, whole body.
2. Scan your whole body for emotional sensations.

## Technique: Focus on Positive

Focus on nice things and the good feelings this generates.

* Loneliness and isolation are damaging to health, and focus on positive seems to counter some of this.
* Enhances wellbeing and helps you feel more positive emotions while building resilience.
* Pitfalls to avoid: Ironic focus on nice things, guilt about positive emotion, and being drawn into a negative quagmire.

1. Think of someone you love. Picture them having the greatest day of their life, see their happiness and joy. At the same time, mentally form a series of positive wishes or statements of intention like "I wish ..." or "I hope ...".
2. Keep seeing and saying these things, periodically checking for positive body sensation. (3-5 minutes)
3. Let go of mental images and mental talk, focus on positive emotional body sensations until they return to neutral.

* Variations: Focus on yourself or focus on someone you are in conflict with.

## Technique: Focus on Now

Focus on the present moment, notice and accept whatever comes.

* When going well it will feel like flow, when going poorly it will be boring.

1. Focus on meta-attention, the thing that tells you what you are presently focusing on.
2. Let your attention notice any aspect of the present moment.
3. If your mind wanders from the present moment, bring it back.

# The Mindful Geek: Mindfulness Meditation for Secular Skeptics by Taft, Michael


## CHAPTER ONE

- So what can mindfulness meditation actually do for you? (278)
- Improve Your Focus— Focus is a trainable skill, and meditation systematically trains you to concentrate. (281)
- Reduce Your Stress (293)
- Enhance Your Empathy (307)
- Freedom from Automatic Reactions (313)
- Increase Your Cognitive Flexibility (320)
- Boost Your Memory (329)
- Make You Less Sensitive to Pain (338)
- Give You a Better Brain (343)
- It’s also shown to “slow, stall, or even reverse age- related neurodegeneration,”[ (350)

## CHAPTER TWO

- We’ll leave aside any conjectures about “spiritual” improvement or growth as outside the scope of this book. Instead we’ll only look at things that benefit you in one or all of these practical ways. Is it making you happier, healthier, and more effective or not? Is it reducing stress, helping you sleep soundly, and improving your relationships, or not? (391)
- When you use meditation to become more aware of what you’re feeling, the unconscious or semi- conscious flavors of emotional experience begin to come into focus. Your own motivations and drives become clearer. Not just in a conceptual way, but in a way you can physically detect, moment by moment, throughout your day. This is the essence of emotional intelligence, and it is life changing. (423)
- There are many other possibilities, such as learning to consciously relax, learning to consciously appreciate external sensory perception, learning to consciously experience pleasure, and more. (444)
- I feel something similar about meditation practice. Meditation teaches you to examine your everyday sensory experience very closely. The insights into your own motivations, drives, and behavior you get from doing that regularly is quite illuminating and helpful in your life. I call this feature of meditation the “under the hood” benefit. (457)
- Whatever you focus your attention on, regularly over time, will change the brain itself— physically alter it, some parts becoming larger or smaller— to get better at processing the thing you’re focusing on. (492)
- mindfulness meditation is a psychological technique that involves paying attention to your present- moment sensory experience in a nonjudgmental manner, and which makes the unconscious conscious for the purpose of improving your life. (546)
- The goal is not to empty your mind of thoughts; the goal is to pay attention to some aspect of your current sensory experience. (555)
- The second misconception is that meditation is something that is supposed to be blissful or pleasurable. (563)
- Mindfulness meditation involves paying attention to your present- moment sensory experience in a nonjudgmental way. It doesn’t mean stopping thinking, emptying your mind, or feeling blissful. Thoughts and negative feeling are fine, if they arise. (575)
- The goal is to get you meditating 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week. (585)
- Of course, it’s not required that you do that much. Even 10 minutes a day will get you far. (587)

## CHAPTER THREE

- These insights may be utterly quotidian at this point, or they may not. Not every insight will be earth- shattering. Many of them are mundane, but as a group, as a body of knowledge, they slowly add up to something useful. (672)

## CHAPTER FOUR

- By giving a name to your experience, you can begin to get a handle on it, a new ability to understand and cope with it. (745)
- First, remember that meditation is not about clearing your mind of thoughts. Second, labeling is a great ally in meditation and is a standard feature of mindfulness practice. Distracted thoughts pull your attention away from the object of your meditation, but labeling helps to focus your attention on it. (749)
- The labels also tend to fill up the mental talk channel with calm, neutral words, rather than agitated, unpleasant words, which also enhances the effects of meditation. There is some interesting research evidence that suggests that the process of labeling in meditation (particularly labeling affect, or feeling tone) increases the potency of mindfulness’s beneficial effects.[ (752)
- Let’s look at how to label correctly and how to avoid the most common pitfalls. (762)
- Be Gentle (763)
- Allow all your labeling to be soothing. Do it in a relaxed and open manner. (764)
- Don’t Try Too Hard (765)
- Just relax and label what you comfortably can without getting too wound up or stressed out about it. (767)
- You Don’t Have to Be Right (768)
- It’s not a Mantra (772)
- Each label names a specific object (or objects) you’ve noticed. In a way, it’s like adding metadata tags to each sensory event that you notice. (774)
- Slowly, Slowly (775)
- But meditation shouldn’t be speedy and frantic like that. Instead, allow a single label to count for several instances of similar objects arising. Keep the speed down to something like one label every few seconds. More than that can feel too busy and disrupt the focusing effect of the labeling. (780)
- Always Optional (783)
- The point of labeling is to help you focus, and these options exist to give you extra assistance when you’re having trouble focusing. (787)
- Spoken Labels (789)
- Multiple Labels, or “Re- noting” (791)

## CHAPTER FIVE

- The most common mistake, and the most ironic, is getting caught up in the idea that you’re messing it up. (809)
- A second problem is letting yourself become grossly distracted. (813)
- Fantasizing on purpose is different from just getting distracted, which is totally normal and not a problem. (817)
- The third common problem is falling asleep. (820)
- A fourth common problem is trying too hard. (825)
- A fifth common problem is stopping the meditation before you’re finished. Usually this happens because you just can’t stand to sit anymore. You feel too upset, anxious, busy, distracted, or bored to keep going, and so you give up before the timer rings. (830)
- The secret to being able to stay sitting when you feel like you just can’t stay sitting is this: meditate on the reaction that’s trying to catapult you out of your seat. (834)
- With practice, meditating on the reaction to the meditation can significantly deepen your meditation, as well as keep you seated for the allotted time. (838)
- The last common problem is a little subtler: entertaining yourself with a slew of different meditation techniques. (839)
- If you want to switch techniques in different sessions, that’s fine, but don’t give in to the urge to jump from technique to technique in a single session. (845)
- In order to meditate, it helps to sit with your back upright. (854)
- When the spine is erect, it signals the central nervous system to be more alert. (854)
- Beyond that one condition, I don’t recommend worrying about your posture. (857)
- Beyond that, being as comfortable as possible is important. Once you’re sitting in your meditation posture, refrain from outright fidgeting. (868)
- Remaining physically still creates a feedback loop with your mind and allows your thoughts to settle down. There are other factors as well, such as the fact that it’s much easier to meditate on subtle body sensations when you’re not moving around. (878)

## CHAPTER SIX

- In meditation class, we also begin with a concept of three separate but interconnected pieces: concentration, sensory clarity, and acceptance (CCA). (890)
- Concentration means being able to train your attention on whatever object you choose, and sustain it there over time. (893)
- Sensory clarity means having a lot of resolution of the details of whatever object you’re focusing on. (894)
- Acceptance means having an attitude of openness, curiosity, and nonjudgment with whatever is happening in the moment. (896)
- If even one of these elements is a little bit present, you can have a decent meditation. (900)
- If two or three of the elements are strong, then your meditation experience will usually be quite good. Developing all three is the key to strengthening and deepening your meditation practice. (910)
- Concentration, or focus, means that you can direct your attention to the object you choose, and hold it there. The better your concentration, the longer you can hold it without interruption. (915)
- It’s natural and even healthy that, in the beginning, your attention is going to be captured by things that are not your meditation object. (935)
- The solution is simple: brute force repetition. Each time your attention is drawn away from the meditation object, gently bring it back. Over and over, notice that your focus has wandered and return it to the chosen object. Each one of these returns can be thought of as a concentration “rep,” just like a weightlifting “rep” at the gym. (938)
- So this sort of iteration increases the time dimension of your concentration. Your attention span gets huge.[ (950)
- Gaining the ability to focus on anything you want to, for as long as you want, is one of the most powerful ways the mindfulness meditation can improve your life. (957)
- Sensory clarity takes a while to develop and requires that you attempt to make ever- finer sensory distinctions in your meditation practice. (965)
- Sensory clarity is wonderful for other senses, too. Imagine gazing at your favorite works of art (or other beautiful objects) with eyes that have developed a high degree of visual resolution. It’s like HD for your eyes, or listening to your favorite music with super- attuned hearing. Even your senses of taste and smell can vastly improve with sensory clarity. (999)
- Acceptance is extremely simple, much simpler than the other two. Just accept whatever your experience is, that’s all. (1005)
- The motto for acceptance is, “It is what it is.” (1009)
- It’s important to notice that acceptance means accepting your sensory experience, not accepting the conditions of your life. (1010)
- Acceptance will not only deepen your meditation practice considerably, it will also alter your life in other ways.[ 54] When you quit resisting everything all the time, things can become easier and more enjoyable for you very quickly. (1013)
- Most of us live in a state of perpetual “could be better.” (1022)
- Each of the three elements of meditation— concentration, sensory clarity, and acceptance (CCA)— can almost function as a complete meditation on their own. (1031)
- Putting them all together in a single practice, however, each one of them tends to reinforce the others. (1032)

## CHAPTER SEVEN

- Just as concentration can be expressed as an algorithm, the process of mindfulness meditation can also be modeled as a repeated sequence of steps. This algorithm assumes that you’ve already sat down, relaxed, and gotten all set to meditate. (1042)
- 1. Notice the focus object. 2. Label the focus object. 3. Allow awareness to deeply contact the focus object. 4. Feel acceptance toward whatever you find there. 5. Continue focusing, contacting, and accepting for about 5 seconds. 6. Repeat. (1046)
- You’ve got to put in the time doing the tiny steps, to make sure you’re getting the full benefit. Eventually, these steps will unfold all at once, like one big Step 5, and it will feel as if you’ve been doing it for your whole life, like you were born to meditate. And that, my friend, will feel good. (1093)
- “Contacting it deeply” means to actively explore your focus object with a lot of curiosity. You definitely do not want to let Step 2 be the end of the process. Here, we’re using the label as a signal to dig more deeply into the richness and depth of the experience. You want to get the sense that awareness is caressing, investigating, even permeating the focus object. (1108)
- It may seem like it’s possible to take this too far, and you may be tempted to just sort of ballpark it. I mean, pay attention to every little detail of sensation in your hand? Really? But the secret to success with sensory clarity is to take it too far, take it way, way too far. (1115)
- The more you gently stretch yourself in the effort to investigate ever- subtler details of sensation, the more you’re building the part of your brain (the insula) which allows you to feel your own body. It takes effort, but the effort is not wasted. (1118)
- So really challenge yourself to dig into the details of sensation before moving on to Step 4. At a minimum, make sure you feel at least one very specific sensation somewhere in your hand. (1120)

## CHAPTER EIGHT

- The fundamental aspect of a nervous system, whether that of a snail, a fish, a parrot, or a human being, is that it functions as a behavioral guidance system. It orients you toward food, shelter, mates— things that help with survival— and away from predators, cliffs, and poisons— things that do you in. (1190)
- In animals with nervous systems, this behavioral guidance is subjectively experienced as signals of pleasure and pain. (1195)
- The biological wisdom[ 61] built into the nervous system is the result of millions of years of evolution— which things are pleasant and which cause pain are usually things that are survival- positive and survival- negative, respectively.[ 62] (1204)
- Recent research seems to indicate the core of this pleasure/ pain learning system is centered in the structure known as the amygdala.[ 63] (1210)
- In mindfulness meditation, the general stance is to attempt to accept and investigate all sensory experience, regardless of its hedonic tone. (1237)
- There are several good reasons to do this. (1239)
- One is that it’s hard to investigate experiences that you are avoiding, suppressing, or denying. (1240)
- Given that pain signals are just as valuable behaviorally as pleasure signals, this is in itself interesting and useful. (1242)
- A second reason is related to the first— you can get large insights by looking into painful sensations (especially very minor ones). (1244)
- A third reason is that our avoidance of pain signals, and the underlying conviction we have that they are bad, actually makes them worse. (1246)
- And emotional distress is known to make physical pain worse— a fact exploited by torturers worldwide.[ 66] (1249)
- The good news is that the opposite is also true— positive emotional experiences can make physical pain much less intense— and we can use this fact to our advantage in meditation. (1252)
- And what about pleasurable sensations? How should you encounter those in meditation? For one, you are encouraged to enjoy them to their fullest. You can do this deeply by using concentration (to focus on them specifically) and sensory clarity (to get into the fine details of the pleasure), and— as usual— by accepting whatever you experience. (1271)
- It sounds easy, but remember that acceptance isn’t just allowing it or letting it in, it also means not holding onto it, and includes letting it go. (1275)

## CHAPTER NINE

- We are trying to do too much, too fast, all at once, and are living in a state of chronic stress as a result. (1312)
- Stress activates a part of the neuroendocrine system called the hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal (HPA) system. (1313)
- The HPA system evolved to cope with immediate survival threats. (1318)
- First, the HPA system manufactures and releases steroid hormones, called glucocorticoids, including the main stress hormone, cortisol. Cortisol is a crucial chemical for arousing the body to deal with danger (to run away from the tiger that you’ve spotted). It activates the heart, lungs, circulation, metabolism, immune systems, and skin, and prepares them to help you run away as fast as you can. (1320)
- The HPA system also releases neurotransmitters called catecholamines, particularly dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline. Catecholamines suppress the activity of the frontal lobes of your brain, making simple decision- making easier (fight or flight, anyone?), but hindering social interaction and complex task solving. They also trigger the amygdala— an area of the brain associated with an emotional response, usually fear— to have an appropriate response. These neurotransmitters then signal the hippocampus to store the fear and other data about the experience in long- term memory so that you know how to survive a tiger attack next time, if you survive.[ 69] (1324)
- Nature has also developed a second response whose job it is to turn off all these intense reactions and return your body to normal after the tiger has slinked off seeking easier prey. This is called the relaxation response, and it resets the body to its pre- emergency state. (1340)
- Being able to imagine the future (a faculty that scientists call prospection, as if we are imagining where to pan for gold) is one of the most defining features of primate 2.0, the human being.[ 71] (1352)
- Imaginary problems in a distant future are the cause of much chronic stress for human beings. We worry so much about the future that our stress response is on almost all of the time. And all of the advantages of the stress response— the beautiful things it does to our bodies in order to get us out of danger— become disadvantages when they continue over time. (1370)
- Meditation has long been associated with relaxation. (1390)
- Activities that induce a concentrated state are relaxing for many reasons, one of which is that you are focused on something other than your imaginary problems. (1394)
- If you’re relaxing even a tiny bit, then you are doing the technique correctly. (1409)
- Ready for some relaxation? The essence of this technique is to relax your muscles and to meditate on the sensations of them relaxing. (1417)
- By making these unconscious processes conscious, you’ll enjoy them more deeply and get better at inducing them at will. You will also be developing your three elements of concentration, sensory clarity, and acceptance, so it will increase your skill at every other sort of meditation as well. This all makes the Focus on Relaxation technique a uniquely powerful way to work. (1423)

## CHAPTER TEN

- The trouble is that you have to practice meditation almost every day— at least five days a week— to fully reap the benefits of the mindfulness we’ve been discussing. Meditation is much more like brushing your teeth or taking a shower than training for a marathon. The best mindset is to just make it an integral part of your daily routine. (1482)
- A few simple brain hacks can nudge your meditation tendency over the line to a sustainable, lifelong practice. Here are seven methods that do just that: (1486)
- Make a Contract with Yourself— There’s this funny thing about the brain. It really dislikes things that make it look contradictory or hypocritical. (1488)
- Make a Calendar (1498)
- Social Pressure (1515)
- Sit with a Group (1525)
- Make It Hard to Fail (1536)
- Work with a Meditation Coach (1581)
- Once a Week, Consciously List the Goals and Benefits of Mediation Practice (1586)
- You’re meditating to improve your life, and to experience a greater sense of wellbeing. If you remember that, then all this effort to reinforce daily practice will make good sense and keep you on track. (1594)

## CHAPTER ELEVEN

- We don’t pay too much attention to our bodies, but meditation on the body can help us reclaim our embodied awareness. (1608)
- Meditating on the body means meditating on body sensation, not on mental images of the body. (1642)
- When you meditate on the body in this way, it is vital that you learn to listen to the body as the body. (1658)
- The native language of the body is sensation. It is feeling. (1659)
- If you really want to become mindful of body sensations, you have to learn to understand the language of the body. And what the body says in its native language may be very different from the things the mind says about it. (1661)
- For example, we all have a mental image of the size of our various body parts, and a mental image about the size of the body in general. Yet often in mindfulness meditation, the body or parts of the body can feel larger or smaller than the mind knows them to be. (1663)
- Another unusual way the body talks about itself is that it doesn’t always feel like it’s a standard human body. Sometimes it can feel like your legs turn into a ball or your entire body becomes a big, beanbag- like object. (1669)
- A third way that the body may surprise you is that it can feel like it’s changing, morphing, or moving. For example, your hand might feel like it is tingling, or like waves are moving through it, or like it’s growing and shrinking. (1672)
- A major part of this exploration is to work on sensory clarity. To do this, you attempt to explore each sensation in as much detail as possible. (1690)
- First, notice where the sensation feels like it’s located. (1691)
- Next notice the felt size of the sensation. (1693)
- What is its shape? Does it feel spherical, cubic, or like it’s some more complex shape? (1695)
- Feel the texture of the sensation. Is it hard or soft? Smooth or bumpy or wavy? Goopy or crusty? In what ways do different areas of the sensation feel different from each other? (1699)

## CHAPTER TWELVE

- Every formerly wasted moment can become a part of your mindfulness training regimen. (1778)
- Breathe (1779)
- Feel Your Emotions (1784)
- Listen (1789)
- Driving (1793)

## CHAPTER THIRTEEN

- In the context of meditation practice, you can think of two kinds of acceptance. (1869)
- Acceptance One is experienced in the body as some degree of physical relaxation. (1870)
- Acceptance Two is experienced in the mind, as a lack of psychological resistance. (1871)
- Of course, these two aren’t literally different, but thinking about them this way can be helpful. (1874)
- It’s fortunate that there are two different types of acceptance available, because it gives you two different routes into the experience of acceptance. Even if your mind is filled with negative, difficult thoughts, you can often at least get your body to relax (Acceptance One). On the other hand, if your body is tensing up against something (usually pain, but also in disgust about something, etc.) you can find some acceptance in your thoughts about the object (Acceptance Two). Usually, if you can fire up one form of acceptance even a bit, the other one will eventually start coming online also. (1875)
- As with acceptance, there are two kinds of resistance: physical and psychological. Your body tends to tense up all around the painful area. Then you think thoughts about how unfair the pain is, how much you want to escape it, how much you do/ don’t deserve it, and so on. (1904)
- The equation is simple: P x R = S, or “pain times resistance equals suffering.” This means that your level of suffering from pain is dependent upon how much you can let go of resisting it. In other words, relief from pain is all about how much you can accept the pain. (1913)
- Here’s how you work with it. Let’s say you’re meditating on body sensation, and you’re feeling some physical pain. If you want to work with it, begin meditating on the pain sensation. Notice it, label it, contact it deeply (and gently), and accept it completely. Let it be whatever it is. Concentrate on it, and examine its sensory qualities. Where it feels like it is, the physical extent of it, its three dimensional shape. And so on. (1938)
- Focus mostly on the acceptance aspect. (1941)

## CHAPTER FOURTEEN

- Emotions rule your life. Based on that fact alone, understanding the background and function of emotions is clearly of supreme importance. The clearer picture you have of emotions, the clearer picture you have of your entire life, and mindfulness meditation is a very effective method for gaining clarity and insight about your emotions. (1982)
- From an evolutionary perspective of Darwin’s Dharma, emotions evolved to help us survive and thrive, and they do this by motivating and directing our behaviors. (2009)
- This way of looking at emotions is so useful that there is a short mnemonic I want you to use whenever you’re trying to understand an emotion that you’re experiencing: just say to yourself “guidance system.” It forces you to look at an emotion for what it really is: an evolved response. In this sense, there’s no such thing as a positive or negative emotion. (2023)
- The basic emotions are generally agreed to be fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and joy. (2036)
- Fear gets you away from dangerous situations. Anger defends something you want, or drives away something you don’t want. Sadness lets you know when you made a mistake, essentially saying, “Don’t do that again.” Disgust keeps you away from disease agents and poisons. Joy lets you know when you did something right, saying, “Do that again.” (2038)
- Guilt, shame, and embarrassment are all slightly different, but they essentially say, “I’ll never do that again” in a way that the whole group can read. (2043)
- Pride, on the other hand, signals to the group that we did something right, and we’re showing off how great we are. It’s intended to up our status in the group, as well as to encourage group cohesion by showing what is correct or rewardable behavior. (2047)
- The same thing is true of your emotional guidance system. It won’t work unless it has both a positive and a negative with which to motivate and direct you. (2074)
- Having a clear understanding that both positive and negative feelings are natural, adaptive, and useful will go a long way toward engendering a sense of acceptance toward them. (2076)
- This is bad news, if you were under the impression that— if you just made all the right decisions— someday you’d feel good all the time. This misconception is ubiquitous, and has been peddled from every corner of the ideological spectrum. (2077)
- There are at least two problems with the glittering dream of permanent joy: (1) it couldn’t work, and (2) you wouldn’t like it if it did. (2085)
- It’s impossible to be permanently happy because the system always corrects itself. (2086)
- No matter what you’re feeling right now, it’s helpful to realize that it won’t last. (2109)
- The gist of all this is that emotions are central to decision- making. (2135)
- Although economic theory likes to assert that human beings are rational actors, studies have shown repeatedly that we are anything but. Somewhere under the hood, our emotional body sensations are playing a key role in every decision we make. (2136)
- Neuroscientist and author Antonio Damasio calls one idea about how this works the “Somatic Marker Hypothesis,” or SMH. (2138)
- Emotions may be orchestrated deep in the unconscious mind, but it is upon the soma— the feeling body— that their symphony is played out. In short: emotions are mainly embodied events. (2144)
- Which brings me back to why you wouldn’t actually want to feel happy all of the time. If emotions comprise a guidance system, a sort of compass to find your way in life, feeling only constant euphoria would be like sticking a huge magnet to the side of the compass. You would lose all ability to tell direction. Every decision would seem just wonderful, and you would soon end up deep in a ditch. (2174)
- This is also a big reason why taking drugs and alcohol can be so damaging. Besides the physical problems they can create, they lead to poor decision- making. We’re taking them is to manipulate our emotions, to monkey with our emotional tone, but it also screws up our decision- making process. (2179)
- All of the biological and evolutionary background of emotions and emotional responses leads to one big conclusion: it’s a good idea to accept your emotions as they are. (2189)
- First, see that most or all of your behavior every day is directed toward doing things that you think will make you feel good, or removing things that you think are making you feel bad. (2190)
- Second, recognize that human emotions are responses that were programmed into our biology over millions of years. (2194)
- Third— and this is the big one— feeling bad doesn’t always mean that there’s something wrong with you, or that you did something wrong. (2203)
- In mindfulness meditation, however, the main way that we will work with emotions is to both accept them, and to try and acquire a great deal of sensory clarity about them. (2216)
- Meditating on emotions in the body will, like other body sensation meditations, develop your insula,[ 90] which is that part of your brain that is associated with (among other things) the feeling of visceral sensations. (2220)
- Body meditation practice will help you get better at sensing such sensations over time, something that Shinzen calls “skill at feeling.”[ (2223)
- Not only will you know better what you’re feeling, but you’ll get a much better idea what other people are feeling. As I mentioned, we tune into other peoples’ feelings by subtly mimicking their expressions in our own faces as “microexpressions.” (2230)
- Meditating on emotional sensations begins slowly to make the feelings of these microexpressions noticeable, which— much like in the experiment mentioned above— makes it much easier to accurately read what other people are feeling. (2233)
- Viktor Frankl— the neurologist, psychologist, and Auschwitz survivor— once wrote that “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” (2238)
- By cultivating this space between stimulus and response, you gain something every human being ever born has wanted: the ability to choose whether to respond to an emotional urge or not. (2249)
- Focus on Emotion is about contacting a subset of general body sensations. In this case, the subset is composed of sensations that “feel emotional.” (2261)
- Most of the time, emotional body sensations are pretty subtle and normal. The trick is learning to separate them out from all the other sensations going on, to extract the signal from the noise. (2265)
- Let’s begin with a little taste of how this works. (2267)
- make a big smile on your face. (2267)
- Now, bring your awareness into contact with the sensations in your face around the smile. (2269)
- Next, take it further, into something a bit subtler. See if you can feel, in your face, the slightly pleasurable or pleasant sensation associated with the smile. (2273)
- Now feel both things at the same time: the gross sensations in the muscles, skin, and flesh, and the subtler pleasant sensations. You can either contact one at a time, pendulating back and forth between them, or contact both at the same time, using a larger area of focus. Stick with this for a minute or so. (2277)
- Scan your face for any emotional body sensations. (2316)
- Contact the emotional sensation deeply, be as specific as possible about what you feel there, and try to accept whatever it is. (2318)
- If there are no emotional sensations present, that’s fine. Still meditate on the body sensations in your face region for a little while. The label you can use is “none,” meaning no emotional sensations. If, while you’re doing this, an emotional sensation arises, focus on that, and switch to using the label “emotion.” (2320)
- Move on to the throat region, and scan for any emotional body sensations. (2325)
- Move on to the chest region, and scan for emotional sensations. This can be a particularly rich zone for emotions. (2328)
- Move on to the belly region, and scan for emotional body sensations. This can also be a strong area for emotions. (2334)
- Now scan your whole body for emotional sensations. (2336)
- You can stop here, or go back to a region of particularly intense or interesting emotional body sensations and work with that for a longer time. (2338)
- When it’s time to finish, spend at least one minute just sitting quietly, meditating on relaxed sensations in the body before continuing on your day. (2340)

## CHAPTER FIFTEEN

- In most mindfulness meditation, the idea is to accept what you’re feeling, and to greet all emotions with curiosity, openness, and nonjudgment. Even if they are painful and negative, you investigate them in detail. Sometimes, however, digging directly into a big, difficult emotion just isn’t possible or desirable— it might be too gnarly to deal with effectively, like in Roy Batty’s situation. (2357)
- Emotional overwhelm sucks, and it’s not a good place to hang out. (2367)
- It can also make you dissociate. Dissociation happens when the feelings are so bad that you cannot bear to feel your body anymore at all, and you, metaphorically, “leave your body.” That means to lose direct conscious contact with most body sensations. (2368)
- Hopefully these are not common occurrences in your life, but they do happen to all of us sometime, and it’s important to know how to cope. In all of these cases, meditating directly on the intense feelings of emotion in the body may not be the best course of action. (2373)
- There are two basic strategies for working with overwhelming emotions in the body: focus on a neutral spot in the body, or focus on something external. (2376)
- Although emotional sensations can arise anywhere in the body, they are much more likely to arise in the belly, chest, throat, or face. (2379)
- That means that other areas are much less likely to host gigantic emotional sensations, which turns out to be a useful and convenient thing. You can meditate on those emotionally “cold” spots, such as your hands and feet, and stay in touch with your body. (2380)
- The easiest practice is to feel your hands, your feet, or both. Concentrate on the emotionally neutral sensations in these areas. (2385)
- Contact as much of the body as is “safe”— meaning areas not filled with overwhelming feelings. (2387)
- Intense emotions can be seductive, even if they are unpleasant. They are like whirlpools that suck your attention toward them, so avoid allowing yourself to be drawn into the emotional hotspots. Just stay focused on your hands and feet. This is an effective way to work with big feelings. (2388)
- When the body is too emotionally hot, a second good idea is to meditate on something outside the body. External sights and sounds are powerful meditation objects, especially when they are interesting, beautiful, or compelling in some way. (2392)
- I said that there were two techniques, but I’ll toss in a third for free. It’s called pendulation, and it’s slightly more difficult than the above techniques. It often takes some previous experience of focusing on a neutral spot. If you can do pendulation, however, it’s worth it. (2407)
- To pendulate, you first locate an emotional- neutral spot in the body and meditate on it for a little while. The next step is the tough one. If you have a huge emotion occurring, but you think you can contact it, or contact somewhere near it, without getting totally overwhelmed, then do that. Contact some part of the huge emotion and meditate on that for a very brief time. If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, immediately come back to the neutral spot. (2410)
- Then you continue to go back and forth (i.e. pendulate) between the neutral spot and the emotional hotspot. (2413)
- Pendulation is so effective that it’s the core practice of several PTSD treatments. (2419)

## CHAPTER SIXTEEN

- definition of a positive psychology goal to make more sense to an adult trying to have a “good life.” He created a five- part definition of “flourishing,” dubbed PERMA, and posits these five qualities: (2440)
- Positive emotions— means having at least some ability to feel happiness, but also qualities such as interest, excitement, awe, and pride. (2444)
- Engagement— is Seligman’s way of talking about a flow state, when we are absorbed in doing things we find intrinsically interesting. (2446)
- Relationships— probably the most important driver of wellbeing is having family, friends, lovers, and other people to do things with. (2448)
- Meaning— feeling that what you are doing is important, worth doing, interesting, and contributes to the greater good is vital. (2450)
- Accomplishments— human beings find joy in pursuing success and mastery, even if it causes some difficulty and stress. (2451)
- Meaning, according to Seligman, is the one factor that puts the other four into perspective and gives them a context. Without meaning, the other parts of wellbeing ring hollow. (2458)
- Meditation can do a lot to overcome this sense of meaninglessness. At its best, it can begin to infuse your life with a tangible sense of real meaning and purpose. (2465)
- We may think of meaning as being mental or conceptual, but it is through the feelings in your body that you discover where meaning exists for you. What (2468)
- By tuning into your actual feelings about the activities, people, environments, and situations with which you interact, meditation is an extremely potent way to decide what works for you and what doesn’t. (2508)
- If you want to try get in touch with some meaning right now, it’s easy to do. Sit in meditation, relax, and get comfortable. Then bring to mind things that you found meaningful in the past. Do this one at a time, very slowly. As you think of one, search for emotional body sensations about it. Don’t be surprised if there aren’t any, or the ones that arise are not what you expected them to be. It’s extremely important not to judge whatever comes up. (2530)
- Next bring to mind things that you have found meaningful recently. (2533)
- Once you’ve done this, what do you do with the information? Sometimes it’s enough to just know. But it can be helpful to realize that this is your emotional guidance system performing its orienting function. (2538)
- As you practice this more frequently, and act upon what you discover, you’ll find your life taking some surprising turns. Turns in the direction of greater wellbeing and a greater sense of purpose. Enjoy. (2541)

## CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

- Flow does involve work, but it is work that you like doing and can do well. If a challenge is too difficult, frustration and disappointment arise, and that blocks the flow state. Flow has to involve a task you can actually achieve. On the other hand, if the task is too easy, it doesn’t capture your attention, and flow cannot happen either. You get bored and float away into distraction. In between anxiety when the task is too hard, and boredom when it’s too easy, there is a Goldilocks zone for the flow state; a condition of a task that is just right. (2591)
- The secret, then, to good concentration (according to Csikszentmihalyi) is to learn how to make any task you are doing just the right level of difficulty for you. (2595)
- But there is another possibility that I don’t believe Csikszentmihalyi ever mentions: cultivating your ability to focus. (2613)
- That is an example of how meditation can expand the Goldilocks zone for achieving a flow state. Because meditation functions as training in concentration, it gets harder and harder to get either bored or anxious. (2654)
- It’s one of the secrets to making meditation work for you in life: make the effort to meditate on things that are just slightly too hard for your focus ability. This stretches your capacity to handle the anxiety of a task that’s a little hard. Alternately, you can sometimes go back to meditating on something you find intrinsically boring. By maintaining curiosity and interest with a boring focus object, you will discover that it begins to become strangely interesting. (2659)
- Paying close attention even when you feel bored expands your flow channel, making it wider until it becomes quite easy to get into a flow state. You will find yourself in a mild flow state most of the time, and could find yourself in a pretty deep one when you’re meditating. By adjusting your concentration in this way to achieve this state, everything you do all day can become more fun, interesting, and fulfilling. This is especially true in meditation, which, by building concentration, can help you find flow in your life. (2664)

## CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

- Concentration is the opposite of distraction. We tend to think that concentration is a difficult thing to do, but most people don’t have a strong opinion about distractions. That gives you an opportunity to make a clever hack: you can remove distractions as the first step to developing better concentration. You probably won’t have as much resistance to it, and eliminating some distractions from your life, will make building your concentration much easier. (2670)
- We supposedly live in a multitasking world, but multitasking (called “task switching” in neuroscience) is very inefficient, mainly because there is a cognitive cost each time you switch between tasks.[ (2676)
- The cure is to do one thing at a time. That’s it in a nutshell. Do just what you’re doing and don’t do anything else. It’s that else that causes so much trouble. (2680)
- Shut off all other input (2683)
- If you need to use the Internet, block out all other web activities (2688)
- Filter your email (2691)
- Tame your phone (2696)
- Keep non- essential talk to a minimum (2700)
- Remember that these tips don’t just count for work. If you’re playing a game, play the game. If you’re making love, make love. If you’re walking in nature, just walk and enjoy. (2706)
- Pulling the plug on all these distractions can be disconcerting at first. You may feel disoriented, anxious, or alone. (2708)
- Mammals are wired to look for novelty in the environment, a behavior called “seeking.” (2713)
- If you place an electrode in the area for sexual stimulation, for example, and provide the rat with a button that will stimulate the electrode, the rat will press it for a while, achieve satisfaction, and then stop pressing the button, until another day. (2714)
- The same thing happens with hunger and sleep. The rat will press the button until satisfied, become euphoric and relaxed, and then rest, or do something else. (2716)
- If, however, you place the electrode in the area that stimulates seeking behavior (the lateral hypothalamus), you’ll witness something very different. The rat will press the button, and press the button, and press the button, and never reach satisfaction. Rather than becoming euphoric and relaxed, the rat will become crazed, strung out, frenzied; pushing the button until it collapses. (2718)
- The neuroscience behind this is fascinating, but the short version is this: your brain is wired to seek, and it gets a dopamine hit each time it does.[ 103] (2721)
- It makes you feel focused, energized, and good at first, but after a while you just feel stressed, sketchy, and burnt out. (2724)
- The trouble is that evolution did not favor animals that sat around all fat, happy, and satisfied with themselves. (2726)
- This means that the system in your brain is rigged: there seems to be much more drive to seek than to be rewarded. We would rather look than actually find. (2728)
- The seeking urge is deeply baked into the brains of mammals, and it is deeply baked into you. It evolved to help you to thrive in a prehistoric world in which novelty was a rarity, a strange and wonderful newness in an enormous ocean of relative stability and predictability. (2730)
- We can’t stop pressing the seek button, looking for another hit of dopamine. We are information junkies, and our brains are full. (2738)
- We are powerfully motivated to check texts, emails, and other message channels over and over, because there just might be something cool or interesting there. (2744)
- It would be best if you could turn off your smartphone completely while trying to meditate, but practically there are certain calls that it wouldn’t be safe or responsible to miss. Sometimes turning it all the way off actually increases anxiety to the point where it’s worse for concentration. (2748)
- Full screen Mode (2756)
- Getting rid of badges and notifications (2786)
- We are also an extremely social species that evolved to prioritize friends and family above all else. One of the catchiest aspects of a smartphone is its ability to notify you of incoming items of interest. (2786)
- If you are a doctor or fire fighter, getting such alerts makes a lot of sense: your job requires it. For the rest of us, getting alerted all the time is just another way to get constantly interrupted. (2789)
- White noise (2791)
- Surrounded by such a wealth of interestingness, each person has the opportunity to become a connoisseur. (2817)
- We have to decide what is worth noticing, and what sorts of subjects we want to give our full attention. After that we have to practice ruthlessly discarding anything that doesn’t meet our higher standards. (2820)
- Decide how much time per day you actually need to interact with the virtual world and stick to that amount. (2824)

## CHAPTER NINETEEN

- Listening effectively is a powerful skill, yet few people in our society have taken the time to develop it. Most people will talk more or less continuously, and when they actually are quiet, they are thinking of what they are going to say next while pretending to listen to others. (2838)
- If you listen for a few minutes to two people talking like this, you will notice several features about the conversation. First, there is never any silence. Second, because there is no silence, the conversationalists are never actually taking in what the other person is saying. They are not actually listening. Third, since they aren’t taking it in, they aren’t really thinking about it or responding to what’s being said in a meaningful way. (2843)
- Learning to listen means learning to actually pay attention to— to concentrate on— what other people are saying. To really listen, you use your concentration skills on the sounds of speech entering your ears. You listen to your conversation partner’s words as if listening to a favorite song, with your mind focused on what they are saying and what it means. (2849)
- The first step in learning to listen is to learn to be quiet. (2858)
- Try this experiment: When talking with someone, play a mental game of waiting one full second before responding to anything they have said. That’s it, just one second of silence, no matter what you’re talking about. (2861)
- Then respond, saying whatever it is you have to say. (2865)
- By actually giving the other person’s words a moment to sink in before you respond, your connection with that person, the depth of your conversation, will be very noticeable. (2867)
- You will feel yourself opening to the person in a new way. Even if you strongly dislike their ideas, you will begin to open to the person emotionally, and feel into their humanness. They will feel it, too. (2870)

## CHAPTER TWENTY

- The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said that you couldn’t step in the same river twice. (2886)
- There is no possibility for repetition, so why is it that it often doesn’t feel that way? (2888)
- The answer is simple: it’s not the world that is boring and repetitive, it’s your mind that is boring and repetitive. (2890)
- Education is an excellent thing, but in our society we educate people into a mental/ conceptual relationship with life and away from an experiential relationship with it. (2896)
- When was the last time you actually encountered a tree as a tree? (2902)
- We barely encounter trees as sensory experiences at all. Instead, we simply reduce all this sensory richness into a single word, “tree,” and leave it at that. (2905)
- The brain only has so much processing power. So it’s an integral part of our life as adults to be able to focus on what we deem to be important, and what’s important in our society is concepts. (2911)
- The downside is that when work is done, and you want to have some fun, you have a hard time. (2913)
- We evolved from animals, and we require a connection to our senses in order to feel safe, comfortable, happy, and joyous. This is what people are talking about when they talk about “embodiment.” (2919)
- One of the major benefits of mindfulness meditation is that it teaches you to rediscover your senses in a healthy and clear way. (2936)
- Such experiences are not sentimental remembrances, but immediate, sensory events. Experiencing them only requires re- learning how to contact the senses directly, without (or at least bypassing somewhat) the mediation of the conceptual mind. (2939)
- You could almost say in a metaphoric sense that increased sensory clarity gives you more life, since each moment of life can be experienced at a “higher resolution.” (2964)
- The way I see it, reaching toward more sensory clarity builds the insula, and growing the insula enhances sensory clarity. This creates a powerful feedback loop, and is a great example of using brain plasticity in your favor. (2969)
- Contacting your senses automatically begins to pull you out of your mental preoccupations and into what is happening right here and now. (2976)
- This situation is called “getting stuck in a good place.” They’ve gotten to a certain depth in their practice, but they don’t know how to go any deeper. (2989)
- At least 95 percent of the time the answer is very simple: they need to learn to cultivate greater sensory clarity. Exploring smaller and subtler dimensions of sensation is the key to getting out of this rut. (2991)
- In the realm of the body, this means to get even more curious about the fine details of body sensations. (2999)
- For one, I’ve often noticed that people tend to think of body sensations as being flat, two- dimensional. But, since the body is a three- dimensional object, body sensations are not typically flat, but instead are 3D. (3000)
- Another aspect of body sensation that can increase your sensory clarity is the fact that it isn’t always solid or stable. (3009)
- A third way to increase sensory clarity is to investigate areas of the body that you don’t normally investigate. (3016)
- A fourth method for going deeper into sensation is to act like a microscope. Get curious and look at sensations on as fine a scale as you can. (3021)
- A variation on this is attempting to feel more and more subtle sensations. (3025)
- There is a fifth method that works in a very different way to boost sensory clarity. Rather than upping the resolution, it works by making fine distinctions between types of sensations. (3028)
- Try distinguishing between “textures” of sensation: (3030)
- Or note the difference between sensations that are moving and those that are still. (3031)
- Distinguish wave- like movement from broken movement. (3032)
- And so on. (3033)

## CHAPTER TWENTY ONE

- Responding gracefully under stress is a hallmark of wellbeing. It epitomizes the quality known as resilience, which is the ability to bounce back in the face of adversity. (3058)
- Practicing the FOP technique has a calming effect on the nervous system, significantly reducing stress. One study[ 109] found that doing just 10 minutes of it (with no history of practice) increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and decreased respiratory rates in participants, both indicators of relaxation, and another[ 110] showed clear reduction in the immune and behavioral responses indicative of stress. A more far- reaching study[ 111] found that women who had done a significant amount of FOP over time had significantly longer telomere length— a key indicator of longevity— compared to controls, even when levels of past trauma and depression were taken into account. And FOP was shown[ 112] to drastically reduce levels of PTSD and moderately reduce depression in veterans, even three months after they had finished a training course. (3093)
- People doing seven weeks of FOP boosted a wide range of positive emotions, which in turn produced an increase in personal resources such as improved mindfulness, sense of purpose in life, social support, and decreased illness symptoms.[ (3105)
- Focus on Positive practice also boosts your “vagal tone,” which is a key indicator of health and wellbeing.[ (3110)
- the Focus on Positive technique significantly reduced the pain of a migraine headache in subjects (who had never meditated before) after just one 20- minute session.[ 115] A Duke Medical Center study found that people with chronic lower back pain experienced big improvements in both pain and psychological distress compared to controls.[ 116] And research from Emory University showed a relationship between time spent practicing Focusing on Positive and a reduction in inflammation and distress in response to stress. (3118)
- In most of the studies, Focus on Positive not only enhanced wellbeing in a physical sense, but it also helped the person to feel more positive emotions— which is both the goal of the practice and itself a major benefit. (3128)
- One meta- analysis of 30 happiness studies found a very strong relationship between feeling positive emotions and longevity— an effect as large as smoking versus not smoking. (3132)
- feeling positive seems to help protect you against getting sick, but once you are ill, it doesn’t have much effect.[ 118] Another study showed that among male war veterans, optimists experienced fewer incidents of angina and heart attacks.[ 119] And a study of elderly heart surgery patients showed that feeling positive emotions predicted a lower re- admission rate, even when controlled for factors such as health status upon release, length of hospital stay, and so on.[ (3134)
- So practicing Focusing on Positive and experiencing positive emotions constitute a scientifically solid way to increase your resilience, be healthier, live longer, and— even if all that fails— at least you’ll feel much better while you’re doing it. (3142)
- Simply put, the Focus on Positive practice involves thinking about nice things, and meditating on the good feelings this generates. In the first part, “thinking about nice things” you picture a specific person who you want to think about, and then you wish for nice things to happen to them. (3145)
- The second part is to experience the good feelings this generates. (3151)
- If you can only encounter this practice ironically, your challenge will be to find something, somewhere, that you can actually have genuine, heartfelt, straightforward good feelings about. Instead of using an adult human being as your focus object, try beginning with a being who is extremely non- threatening and uncomplicated, like a tiny baby or an adorable puppy or kitten. (3157)
- A second pitfall is feeling guilty about experiencing positive emotions. (3163)
- The Focus on Positive technique will actually help you to make the changes in the world you want to make, because it helps to keep you refreshed and able to work. (3175)
- A third pitfall is when people cannot think of positive things without being drawn into a negative quagmire. (3177)
- Begin by thinking of somebody you love. It can be your mother, your partner, or anybody else. Make sure it is someone that you don’t have complicated or difficult feelings about. It can even be a fictional character. (3205)
- For this example, we’ll use Yoda. (3207)
- Picture Yoda having the greatest day of his life. See him clearly in your mind’s eye as happy and joyful as a Jedi Master can be. (3208)
- At the same time mentally say things in the form of a series of wishes or statements of intention, such as, “I wish that you be happy. I wish that you be healthy. I wish that you have peace in your life.” and so on. (3211)
- Keep seeing happy Yoda, while saying these things to him mentally. As you’re doing this, be careful not to slip into any negative feelings (“ This is silly. He’s a foam rubber puppet.”). Instead, guide your visualization by checking in every so often with emotional body sensation. Make sure that you’re building up happy, joyous, grateful feelings. (3222)
- Keep doing this for 3- 5 minutes. Give it your best effort. Build up a charge of positive emotional sensations, if you can. (3226)
- When the time is up, let go of the intentional creation of mental images and mental talk. Shift your attention completely to emotional body sensation. Locate only positive emotional sensations, and do your meditation algorithm on them. Really allow awareness to “soak into” these feelings. Do this until any positive sensations have gone back to neutral, or whenever you feel done. (3227)
- You have completed one round. Now start the visualization again and do another round. (3230)
- When it’s time to finish, spend at least one minute just sitting quietly, meditating on pleasant sensations in the body before continuing on your day. (3232)
- 1. By far the most important variation of this exercise is to do it for yourself. Because this is often harder for people than doing it for another, I don’t usually start people there. (3236)
- 2. Try doing Focus on Positive for a person you are currently in conflict with. (3239)

## CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

- Evolution has selected us, over long millions of years, to be profoundly social. This doesn’t mean that we like to be in groups, it means that, in some sense, we cannot be fully human without ongoing group contact. (3266)
- Especially before the advent of articulate spoken language, emotional expressions were perhaps our chief mode of communication for working as a team and maintaining group cohesion. (3273)
- Another specially evolved feature in humans is the capacity for empathy and compassion, or what biologists like to call altruism.[ (3275)
- Many researchers contend that mirror neurons constitute an important neural mechanism for empathy. (3295)
- Like all superhero powers, however, there is a hidden downside: our need for social connection means that loneliness and isolation have a profoundly negative impact on our health and wellbeing. (3301)
- Using the new science of social genomics, for example, UCLA researchers John Cappioco and Steve Cole have discovered that loneliness actually alters gene expression in the immune system. (3304)
- In lonely people, immune system genes for fighting bacterial invasion are over- expressed, and the ones for combatting viruses are under- expressed. (3306)
- Furthermore, some of the over- expressed genes in lonely people cause higher blood levels of cortisol (the main hormone implicated in the stress response), leading to greater risk of heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, and blood vessel damage.[ (3311)
- being lonely and isolated makes you about one- third more likely to die young, a finding that remained consistent regardless of gender, length of follow- up, or world region. (3320)
- But the really compelling fact about this study is that they found no difference in the mortality effect between actual isolation and feelings of loneliness. (3323)
- This is the source of a potentially life- changing, or in this case life- saving, possibility. Because if Focus on Positive meditation can increase our feelings of belonging and social support simply by imagining them, that’s just as powerful as having actual belonging and social connections, at least in terms of health. (3326)
- oxytocin has some very attractive qualities. It’s released when we cuddle each other, and increases trust,[ 128] empathy,[ 129] generosity,[ 130] and promotes social bonding. (3337)
- Oxytocin down- regulates the HPA[ 137] (axis of the fight- or- flight mechanism), inhibits the amygdala[ 138] (thereby reducing fear), suppresses cortisol,[ 139] and increases feelings of calm and contentment. So it directly (under most conditions) helps you to chill out and let go of stress. (3357)
- There’s even evidence that oxytocin reduces inflammation factors in the blood which promotes the speedy healing of wounds.[ (3363)
- As of this writing, there is no direct evidence that meditation practice increases oxytocin. However, there are some intriguing hints that this probably is the case. (3367)
- For one, just watching a short emotionally stimulating movie can raise oxytocin levels as much as 47 percent.[ 141] It seems like the brain doesn’t distinguish carefully between empathy for an actual human and empathy for an image of a human being. (3368)
- The Focus on Positive technique leverages this built- in tend- and- befriend feedback to boost your resilience to higher and higher levels. (3376)

## CHAPTER TWENTY THREE

- Some of the most exciting current neuroscience looks into the question of what the brain does when it’s not involved in any particular task. There are colloquial terms for this state of mind, like “daydreaming” or being “checked out,” but in neuroscience it’s called “mind wandering.” Through the use of fMRI, scientists have discovered that there is a specific brain network dedicated to this mode of processing. And in a fascinating experiment, they found out something surprising: most of us are checked out about half of the time.[ (3395)
- The data revealed something important to us in terms of wellbeing: people were on average least happy during mind wandering, and this was true no matter what activity they were doing. (3410)
- So daydreaming often bums you out, and paying attention to the present moment tends to make you feel good. (3413)
- Scientists have discovered that there is a brain network associated with mind wandering, and have named it the default mode network (DMN), since mind wandering seems to be our default setting. (3421)
- To describe it generously, we might say that the default mode network is concerned with evaluating the outcomes of past actions and using that as a basis for planning future actions. In fact, such evaluation and planning is probably the intended function of the default mode network in the brain. (3428)
- Default mode network activity is roughly the opposite of a flow state. (3434)
- The discovery of the DMN has raised a number of very interesting questions about the human brain. (3441)
- For one thing, it suggests that the brain is never actually at rest. (3442)
- A second question revolves around the fact that studies have shown that increased activity and connectivity in the DMN is directly correlated with difficult mental afflictions, such as such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and obsession.[ (3451)
- The complexity of our current environment requires a quantity and intricacy of planning that is likely far beyond anything ever needed in the past. So it’s not that evolution selected for mental illness, it’s that we didn’t evolve to live in a world this labyrinthine, entangled, and interconnected. (3461)
- Luckily, meditation allows you to correct for this over- activity by purposefully down- regulating the DMN, as we’ll see. (3465)
- In fact, the cortical regions of the default mode network are physically thicker in creative individuals[ 149], and having an active DMN does appear to be important in creativity.[ (3468)
- Fortunately, there is a ton of other research that demonstrates that mindfulness meditation is also great for boosting creativity.[ (3474)
- When you allow meditation to come from a place of curiosity and interest, paying attention becomes much easier, and a flow state can arise. (3477)
- Essentially, by letting go of effort and relaxing away from trying, we solve creative problems. As neuroscientist and meditation researcher Judson Brewer puts it in an article exploring the connection between meditation and creativity, “effortlessness may be a key aspect of cultivating the fertile soil for creativity to grow.[ (3485)
- Brewer studies the DMN extensively, and has found (along with others) that the less effort you expend in meditation, the more powerfully you switch off the DMN and the easier it is to enter a flow state.[ (3491)
- Effortlessness may be key, and it turns out that there are meditation practices specifically designed to exploit this fact. (3495)
- But there is a second kind of attention in which you don’t try to control which object you’re paying attention to at all. You allow your attention to wander wherever it likes. This second kind of attention is called “open awareness,” or “choiceless awareness.” The most important feature of open awareness is that it feels effortless. (3498)
- So you don’t care what your focus object is— in a sense, you could say that in this way of working, everything is a potential focus object— but you’re giving your full attention to whatever thing awareness just happens to rest on, moment by moment. (3503)
- because you’re not trying to keep your mind focused on any particular object, and not bringing it back over and over to that object, it feels effortless. (3506)
- All it takes to shut down DMN activity and go into a flow state is to concentrate on a task. The task doesn’t have to be useful or even make sense, it just has to engage you in the present moment. (3509)
- we’ll call open awareness the Focus on Now technique, (3512)
- allow your attention to go wherever it wants, and just notice whatever comes up. (3513)
- No matter how you describe it, the essence is the same: you are paying attention, but not to anything in particular. You are letting go of any sense of trying to do. (3515)
- The goal here is to let go of as much effort as possible, not to judge yourself for not having reached the absolute zero of effort. (3518)
- When it’s going well, this meditation is very pleasurable, having all the intrinsic benefits of a flow state without even the typical focus- object a flow state requires. (3520)
- When it’s not going so well, it can feel like you’re bored and restless, without even the relief of having something to concentrate on. (3523)
- It sometimes helps to frame the Focus on Now practice as a strong acceptance meditation, because to sit and allow almost anything to unfold in meditation is a deeply accepting stance to take. (3525)
- No matter what, it’s important that you do this meditation as with as light a touch as possible. As much as you can, let go of the sense of effort, of trying. (3528)
- Lightly focus on your meta- attention; the thing that tells you what you’re focusing on right now. (3539)
- Now just allow your attention to notice any aspect of the present moment. It doesn’t matter what it is. Just notice, using your meta- attention, that attention is pointed at some aspect of the present. Just sit with that. (3540)
- If meta- attention tells you that attention has left the present moment, bring it back. Do this as gently, softly, and kindly as you can. (3542)
- Try to do this meditation with as little sense of doing anything as possible. You are simply sitting and noticing where attention is going, and gently bringing it back to the present moment. (3544)
- Continue with this for as long as you like. When it’s time to finish, spend at least one minute just sitting quietly, meditating on relaxed sensations in the body before continuing on your day. (3545)

## CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR

- You have learned five different meditation techniques in this book. You may be wondering how to practically deal with them all. The short version is that it’s up to you. (3550)
- The only way that I don’t recommend you use them is all together in one sitting. Restrict each session of meditation to just one technique. (3555)
- The path forward is a simple one: meditate every day that you can. Sit 30 minutes every day if that’s possible, or at least 10 minutes if that’s all you have time for. (3576)
- As you grow in your practice, it helps to have teachers. There are many teachers and classes available, although most of them will not be secular. (3581)
