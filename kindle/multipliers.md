# Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter

* Multipliers:
  * Hold themselves to the gihest standards, offering their very est.
  * Multipliers stretch people, getting more than they knew they had to give.
  * Resource allocation gets too much attention compared to resource leverage.
  * Instead of achieving linear growth by adding new resources, focus on more efficiently extracting capabilities from existing resources.
  * Not about getting more with less, but getting more by using more.
  * See intelligence as continually developing.
  * "In what way is this person smart? What could be done to develop and grow these capabilities?"
  * Bring smart people together in an environment that liberates everyone's best thinking--and then get out of the way and let them do it!
  * Utilizes and increases everyone's genius.
  * Liberator creating a safe environment that fosters bold thinking.
  * Challenger who defines opportunities.
  * Debate makers who generate real buy-in.
  * Investor who gives others ownership and full accountaility.
  * Look into people and find capability, expect great things, and drive them to extraordinary results.
  * Don't shrink so that others can be big, they play in a way that invites others to play big too.
  * Don't take themselves or situations too seriously.
* Diminishers:
  * Intelligence is elite and scarce, and other people will never figure things out without help.
  * See intelligence as something basic/static about people.
  * Empire builder who acquires resources and wastes them.
  * Tyrant who creates a stressful environment.
  * Know-it-all who gives directives.
  * Decision makers who try to sell their decisions to others.
  * Micromanager who jumps in and out.
  * Tend not to understand the restrictive impact they were having on others.

## Talent Magnet

* Know genius comes in many forms, attract talented people and use them to their fullest.
* They are blind to organizational/heirarchical/lateral boundaries and instead see talent networks.
* Understand people love to contribute their genius, so by finding it they open a pathway for that peorson to contribute.
* Know how to uncover and access native genius of others.
* Native genius/talent is something that people do not only exceptionally well, but also easily (without extra effort) and freely (without condition).
* After uncovering native genius, looks for opportunities that demand that capability.
* By telling people what you see, you can raise their awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capaility more fully.
* After engaging the person's genius, they shine a spotlight so others can see their genius in action.
* In addition to giving people resources, they remove impediments, including people who might be blocking or impeding growth.
* "Ignore me as needed to get your job done."
* Most try to retain top players, the best leaders also know when they have outgrown their environment and it's time to let them go.
* Empire Builders:
  * Seek to surround themselves with A players to appear smarter and more powerful, hoarding resources and underutilizing talent.
  * Ensure they are the point of integration.
  * "developing the talent of the team" was amoung the lowest three skills of the Diminisher

## Liberator

* Operates as a peer to everyone they work with and is accessible to all. As a result, people are more transparent.
* Create open, comfortable environment where people can think freely and contribute. When more power is needed they invoke their demanding side which commands only the best performance from others.
* Create an intense environment which requires concentration, diligence, and energy. People are encouraged to think for themselves and experience a deep obligation to do their best work.
* Create an environment where good things happen. Create conditions where intelligence is engaged, grown, and transformed into success.
* When decisions are collective, mistakes are too. No one person takes the blame. Teams do postmortems and learn how to avoid the error.
* Create both comfort and pressure in an exchange: they give space and expect to get back others' best work.
* As a manager you know when someone is below their usual performance. It's harder to know if someone is giving everything they have. Asking whether people are offering their best gives opportunity to push beyond previous limits.
* Requiring best work is different from insisting on a desired outcome.
* People's best thinking must be given, not taken. Instead of demanding best work, create an environment where it can not only be offered, but where it is deeply needed.
* Give space to make mistakes, but expect people to learn from them. Another exchange: they give permission to make mistakes and expect them to be learned from and not repeated.
* Amplify voices to extract maximum intelligence and give advantage to ideas and voices on the lower end of the playing field.
* More than good listeners, ferocious listeners. List to feed their hunger for knowldeg, to learn what other people know and add it to their own reservoir of knowledge.
* During a crisis, they ask even more questions that force you to really think through a situation. You feel their stealthy hand guiding decisions.
* Wisdom comes from all across the organization. But as a leader you have to do more than just not discourage it, you need to actively encourage people to speak up. The leader has to ask questions and invite the most junior people to express ideas.
* It's a small victory to create space for others to contribute. It is a huge victory to maintain the space and resist the temptation to jump back in and consume it yourself.
* Divide views into "soft opinions" where you have perspective to offer and ideas for others to consider and "hard opinions" where you have a clear and potentially emphatic point of view.
* If you want your org to take risks, you must seperate experiment from outcome. Have zero tolerance for not running/executing the experiment, but don't hold them accountable for the outcome.
* Give permission to make mistakes and the obligation to learn from them.
* Create rapid cycle of thinking, learning, making/recovering from mistakes to generate the best ideas and create and agile organization.
* By making mistakes public, you make it safe for others to take risks and fail.
* It's okay to fail, just don't make the same mistake twice.
* Limit your own contributions to leave space for others.
* There is no easier way to invite experimentation and learning than to share stories about your own mistakes.
* When we help people see a path to recovery, we spawn a learning cycle.
* Let people know about mistakes you have made and what you have learned from them.
* Instead of talking about mistaked behind closed doors or one-on-one, bring them out in the open where the person making the mistake can clear the air and everyone can learn. Make it part of your management ritual.
* Define space for experimentation by clarifying the area where it's okay to fail versus when failure isn't an option.
* Tyrants:
  * create a tense environment of stress and anxiety.

## Challenger

* Peter Drucker - "number one difference between a Nobel Prize winner and others is not IQ or work ethic, but that they ask bigger questions."
* Invite others to explore the impossible, the uncertain, uncomfortable places that stretch both imagition and capabilities.
* Instead of knowing the answer, use smarts to find opportunities for the org and challenge/stretch the org to get there. Push beyond their own knowledge and that of the organization.
* Assumes that people get smarter and stronger by being challenged.
* By accepting they don't have all the answers, challenger's are free to ask much bigger, more provocative, and, frankly, more interesting questions. They can pursue things they don't know how to do.
* Instead of telling others answers, they share the fundamental questions, trends, and assumptions shaping their views.
* Don't give answers, instead providing just enough information to provoke thinking and help people discover and see opportunities for themselves.
* When others see the need for themselves, they develop a deep understanding, and often all the leader needs to do is get out of their way and let them solve the problem.
* Asks questions that challenge fundamental assumptions and disrupt prevailing logic.
* Analyze problems, but also reframe them to shaw opportunities presented by challenges.
* Provide a starting point, not a complete solution. Thereby generating more questions than ansnwers, which encourage their team to fully define the opportunity while gaining confidence they are building a solid foundation.
* Create space between what people know and what they need to know, drawing them into the challenge.
* First, exnted a clear and concrete challenge. Then ask hard questions that need to be answered, but -most important- don't answer them. Let others fill in the blanks.
* Make challenges more concrete (tangible/measurable) to allow others to visualize the achievement and communicate confidence that the org has what is required.
* Ask hard questions that challenge people not only to think, but to rethink. Ask such immense questions that people can't answer them based on current knowledge and where they stand. To answer these, the organization must learn.
* By asking hard questions and inviting others to fill in the blanks, the burden of thinking is shifted to other people. The onus sits with the team to understand the challeng and find a solution.
* Generate the belief that the impossible is actually possible. It isn't enough to see and understand the stretch, people actually need to stretch themselves.
* Start with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward greater stretch challenges.
* Accelerate performance because org doesn't have to wait for leader to tell them something or approve.
* Start by developing an overactive and imagination and serious case of curiosity.
* The question "why" s at the core of their thinking and takes the form of an insatiable need for deep organizational understanding.
* Bad leaders tell people what to do. Good leaders ask questions and let their people figure out the answers. Great leaders ask questions that focus the intelligence of their team on the right problems.
* Engage you team by giving them a "mission impossible", a hard, concrete challeng that wil stretch them and develop new capailities.
* When leaders offer a challenge and create a culture of belief, the organization steps up.
* Help people see the need that must be met. Make it a learning experience that will reveal need, create energy, and ignita e afire within your org.
* Get the entire org to take a small, first step. Do it together so everyone can see the results and start to believe that something great is possible.
* Diminishers:
  * Overly focused on what they know, thereby limiting what the organization can achiev to what they themselves know how to do.
  * Instead of enabling stretching toward future opportunity, give direction in a way that showcases their own knowledge. Instead of seeding opportunity and laying out believable challenge, they tell an dtest.
  * Tend to sell their ideas rather than learning what others know.
  * Ask questions to make a point rather than gain greater insight or generate collective learning.
  * Rather than shifting responsibility, they stay in charge and tell others -in detail- how to do their jobs. They give themselves permission to generate both questions and answers.
