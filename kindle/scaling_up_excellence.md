# Scaling Up Excellence

Scaling Up Excellence is about the challenge of spreading constructive beliefs and behaviors from the few to the many.

## Key Lessons

1. Rational arguments are rarely sufficient to provoke action. Success hinges on stoking emotions that fuel tangible, desirable actions.
2. Scaling is more than just the Problem of More, it is constantly seeking and implementing better ways of thinking and acting across old and new corners of the system.
3. People adept at scaling excellence talk and act as if they are knee-deep in a manageable mess.
4. Scaling starts and ends with individuals, and success depends on the will and skill of people at every level.

## Ground War

* Effective scaling depends on believing and living a shared mindset (sacreds/taboos) throughout your group, division, or organization.
* Scaling requires grinding it out, and pressing each person, team, group, division, or arganization to make one small change after another in what they believe, feel, or do.
* As expansion occurs, the goal isn't maintaining, it is working day after day to make the system better.
* Sustaining and constantly improving mindset is like being in a high-maintenance personal relationship. Constant vigilance is required.
* Mindset and excellence are rarely lost all at once. It usually happens via many small, seemingly innocent moves that chip away at what is sacred, transforming it into hollow and hypocritical words.

1. Spread a Mindset, Not Just a Footprint - Focus on what is sacred and what is taboo. Focus on behaviors that demonstrate and reinforce, and remain constantly vigilant.
2. Engage All the Senses - Look for ways to provide subtle queues toward mindset, as these reinforce without increasing cognitive load. In particular, spot and remove "dissonant details" that clash with mindset.
3. Link Short-Term Realities to Long Term Dreams
4. Accelerate Accountability - try to design a system where responsibility is constant, strong, and embraced by everyone (so slackers, energy suckers, and selfish soloists have no place to hide).
5. Fear the Clusterfug - Combination of Illusion (that things will be easy), Impatience (rolling things out before they are ready), and Incompetence (deciders lack knowledge/skill, which transforms others into incompetents due to lack of support). This trifecta causes things to fail big and late, rather than early and cheap.
6. Scaling Requires Both Addition and Subtraction - Keep an eye out for what "got us here, but won't get us there" and strip it away.
7. Slow Down to Scale Faster -- and Better -- Down the Road - Slow down when you don't know enough, risks are high, or you are stuck.

## Buddhism vs Catholocism

* Catholicism aims to replicate preordained beliefs and practices. Buddhism shares a mindset, but leaves specifics to person and place.
* Beware the "replica trap", where you believe that the same results can be acheived by doing the same thing all over the place.
* Not a binary decision, each approach is better in different situations.
* Partnerships generate Buddhist pressures, because it is hard to maintain purity with additional inputs/context.
* Sometimes to spread footprint faster and further, you may need to sacrifice short-term excellence. Unfortunately learning in this context can also suffer/lag.
* It can help to focus on a short list of non-negotiables as "guard rails", and leave flexibility outside these bounds. Can be especially helpful if plagued by excessive standardization and replication. After selecting guardrails, tell and (especially) show everyone that crashing through them has unpleasant consequences, but otherwise give flexibility.

### Signs of Overkill

1. Do You Suffer from Delusions of Uniqueness? - Keep an eye out for areas that really do not gain value from being different.
2. Do You Have a Successful Template to Use as a Prototype? - Even if you do, keep an eye out for evidence that it may need revision/tweaks.
3. Will Bolstering Buddhism Generate Crucial Understanding, Commitment, and Innovation? - Giving flexibility also gives ownership and accountability.

## Hot Causes, Cool Solutions: Stoking the Scaling Engine

* The best place to start is anyplace you can. Arguments persist about starting with belief or behavior, but the two are mutually reinforcing.
* Hot causes trigger attention, emotional energy, and commitment. The way they are communicated matters as much as the content, nonverbal behaviors are especially crucial. Emotions are contagious.
* The cause alone will not be enough, without a solution, commitment and accountability will wane.
* Mindset should be treated like a compass or GPS. It points you in the right direction most of the time, but sometimes can run into obstacles or cause you to miss your destination.

1. Name the Problem - the name should provide a compact summary that helps people understand the challeng, explain it, and guides them toward cool solutions.
2. Name the Enemy - the cause is amped up if you can point to an external threat to bolster solidarity and cooperation
3. Do It Where All Can See - people are more likely to stick to things the commit to publicly
4. Breach Assumptions - breaching experiments can reveal contours of unwritten social rules
5. Create Gateway Experiences and On-Ramps - onboarding experiences that ease adoption can go a long way.
6. New Rituals, Better Rituals - rituals can create or reinforce mindset, especially when performed publically, by all, and repeatedly. Interaction rituals in particular can be good to focus on.
7. Lean on People Who Can't Leave Well Enough Alone - focus, at least initially, on those who jump at the chance to live the new mindset.

### Change Resistors

1. Routine seekers, agreeing with statements like "I would rather be bored than surprised."
2. Become tense, stressed, and uncomfortable at the prospect of dealing with new challenges and chores
3. Short-term thinkers, agreeing with statements like "When someone presses me to change something, I tend to resist even if I think the change may ultimately benefit me."
4. Prone to cognitive rigidity, agreeing with statements like "once I come to a conclusion, I am not likely to change my mind."

## Cut Cognitive Load: But Deal with Necessary Complexity

* "Rules, tools, and fools." make every organization tick.
* As organizations grow, metrics, procedures, and chores have a tendency to pilu up until capacity and will power to do the right thing are diminished.
* Bigger teams help each other less, because it becomes difficult to maintain that many relationships and coordinate with that many people.
* Research (J. Richard Hackman) concludes that optimal group size is 4-6. Problems seems to grow exponentially as team size grows.
* Well-crafted rules and processes create predictability, reduce conflict, facilitate coordination and reduce cognitive load by providing proven responses to routine situations (instead of needing to reinvent the wheel).
* Heirarchy clarifies who makes decisions (and who does not), when decisions are final, and many other details like wher to sit, who talks more/less, what to wear, when meetings start and end.
* Be wary of "coordination neglect"/"scaling fallacy", which comes with the underestimation of the increasing percentage of time, resources, and staff required to orchestract action as an organization expands.
* As organizations grow, heirarchy/process/structure become necessary to prevent chaos, but give ground grudingly. Try to understand when you are at the Goldilocks "just right" level, vs when you can wait a bit longer.

1. Subtraction as a Way of Life - Ruthlessly spot and remove crummy/useless rules, tools, and fools that clog up the works and cloud people's minds. Move from simplistic, to complex, to profoundly simple.
2. Make People Squirm - If you aren't upsetting people while subtracting, you aren't pushing hard enough. Subtraction is jarring because humans like familiar and dislike unfamiliar.
3. Bring on the Load Busters: Subtraction by Addition - Not only do we have poor memories, we tend to ruminate/act-upon trivial and useless distractions, making it hard to focus on clrucial concerns. Focus on affordances to help focus on what matters. ie firefighter hand-off scripts
4. Divide and Conquer - Look for opportunities to provide challenges that require cooperation and a sense of being on the same team.
5. Bolster Collective Brainpower: Increase Cognitive Capacity Instead of Adding More People - Keeping teams at least partially intact and stripping away irrelevant things help.

## The People Who Propel Scaling: Building Organizations Where "I Own the Place and the Place Owns Me"

* Scaling depends on both bringing in the right talent and having people who feel compelled to act in the organizations best interests ("accountability") and who press one another to act that way too.
* When people put their own needs first, excellence suffers because they feel no obligation to mentor newcomers or help calleaguse do great work.
* Focus less on hiring fully formed superstars and more on selecting promising people, then teaching and motivating them.
* Employees should act "like they own the place", but also feel like the "place owns them." Ownership encourages them to push themselves and others toward excellence, whereas being "owned" means expecting, accepting, and working hard to meet high standards of others.
* Scaling stumbles when too little effort is made to mesh talents, develop skills, and providing incentives to pass along tricks of the trade and pitch in to help finish projects.

1. Squelch Free Riding - Even a few free-riders can spread selfishness and greed like wildfire. Highlight ownership and encourage spreading it to others.
2. Inject Pride and Righteous Anger - When people feel proud about scaling something great, angry at those who might impeed their effort, or both, they think and worry less about selfish desires and concerns.
3. Bring in Guild-Prone Leaders - Leaders prone to guilt are especially likely to display concern for others and put the greater good ahead of their personal goals and glory.
4. "I'll Be Watching You": Use Substle Cues to Prime Accountability - Provide other reminders that use all five senses.
5. Create the Right "Gene Pool" - Experiences and training are crucial to spreading the right beliefs, behaviors, and skills.
6. Use Other Organizations as Your HR Department - If you can find quality organizations that share values, hiring from them can be an effective training shortcut.
7. Hire People Prewired to Fit Your Mindset - Those who already share similar values will need less training and adjustment.

## Connect People and Cascade Excellence: Using Social Bonds to Spread the Right Mindset

* Scaling hinges on discovering (or creating) pockets of excellence and connecting those who have it, their ideas and expertise, to others.
* After this initial pocket, the existing pockets can be leaned on to teach us and others, and these groups can lead further recruitment efforts.
* It is important to connect diverse groups, not just more people. Diverse groups will have more varied interconnections, and when broader groups are involved early adopters will be less worried about being outliers or taken advantage of.
* Seek out master multipliers, who couple deep knowledge and enthusiasm with an ability to find others te help them fuel further spread of ideas.
* Emotions are contagious, focus on finding people who engergize others to aide early spread of mindset.
* Activate Dormant Connections: Remind people of the connection. Channel those feeling stoward action. Make it easy for these recruits to live excellence and spread it on.
* Consider gamifying things. ie using a stock-market game where people can propose ideas, invest, etc to help identify ideas.
* Once is not enough, one exposure is rarely enough for beliefs and behaviors to be adopted. One is not enough, not every tool is right for every job, nor are they mutually exclusive, a blend of tools often works best.
* Create shared rhythms, which help people develop bonds.
* Connectors must also snip or weaken links that create tunnel vision or distorted and dangerous views of reality.

1. The Top-Down Approach - Heirarchies can often help start a cascade, but for more complex and controversial changes it is often not enough.
2. Broadcast Your Message Out to One and All - Help remind people and spread the word, but often need one-on-one support to really recruit people.
3. Surround Them: Have the Many Teach the Few - An effective - if inefficient - way is to take one person, or a small group, and embed them in a larger group that already lives the mindset.
4. One on One: The Power of Pairs - One of the most successful scaling tools is to pair off people, so that one can "topple" the next. Critical not just for teaching new ideas, but also for persuading others to support and smoothing implementation. Seek out supporters and fence-sitters, avoid resistors.
5. From the Few to the Many - Find ways to get existing converts to engage/partner on existing teams, while also teaching and spreading their mindset.
6. Brokers: Bridging Disconnected Islands - Fill holes between disconnected groups by transfering information, expertise, ideas, and influence from those who have it to those who need it.
7. Create Crossroads Where People Connect - Bazaarlike settings enable people to build new connections and strengthen old ones -- largely through one-on-one interactions.

### Leaders as Connectors: Three Litmus Tests

1. Ask diverse members about key aspects of strategy, operations, policies, philosophy, and pressing problems. If they give inconsistent or clashing answers, it is a sign of trouble, especially if they don't have knowledge or interest in the other answers.
2. Is there evidence of a lot of one-on-one interactions, or conversely, evidence that there is little if any interaction?
3. Have you done everything possible to make sure that the ties that bind you don't also blind you?

## Bad Is Stronger Than Good: Clearing the Way for Excellence

* Destructive behaviors of just about every stripe -- selfishness, nastiness, anxiety, laziness, dishonesty, etc -- pack a bigger wallop than constructive behaviors.
* Several reasons help explain why people who witness bad behavior don't move to stop it:
  * Ambiguity
  * "Diffusion of responsibility" or bystander effect
  * Because no one else is helping, they may worry about disapproval if they jump in.
* To counter bystander inaction:
  * Make sure each person feel personally obligated to reverse or repari problems, no matter what others around them do or don't do.
  * Make sure everyone knows and agrees on what bad behavior looks like. Err on the side of being explicit, loud, and repetitive.
  * Make sure bad behaviour does now become "normalized", ie necessary evil, inevitable/unstoppable, expected, accepted, or even good naughty fun.
* Destructive mindsets often emerge when the easiest (or only) way to get well-meaning incenctives is to do something bad.

1. Nip It in the Bud - Even a little bit of bad can signal that no one is watching, no one cares, and no one will stop people from doing even worse things.
2. Get Rid of the Bad Apples - One of the most reliable fixes is to remove the bad apples (note sometimes bad apples in one context are good apples in another).
3. Plumbing Before Poetry - Getting people to focus on the small, mundane, and sometimes gritty details of organizational life is an effective path for eliminating the negative.
4. Adequecy Before Excellence - Customer loyalty has much more to do with keeping plain/vanilla promises than dazzling them.
5. Use the Cool Kids (and Adults) to Define and Squelch Bad Behavior - Recruit the most admired and connect people, teach them what "bad" looks like, and encourage them to stop being perpetrators.
6. Kill the Thrill - Bad can sometimes feel good. Focus on removing prestige from the bad behavior, and look for other incentives or disincentives.
7. Time Shifting: From Current to Future Selves - Sometimes you can break bad cycles by getting people to think about the person they hope to be, rather than just the person they are now. You can encourage this shift by making ambitious goals more vivid and emotionally compelling.
8. Focus on the Best Times, the Worst Times, and the End - No matter how good or bad an experience is, or how long it lasts, our judgement is disproportionally shaped by the best and worst moments and if it ended well or badly (Daniel Kahneman's "peak-end rule"). Remember and focus on this, for instance as it relates to employee careers.

### Warning Signs: Five Dangerous Feelings

1. Fear of taking responsibility, especially if it seems safer to do nothing, or something bad, than the right thing. Silence is one of the most reliable signs of thsi.
2. Fear of being ostracized, or socially excluded. Best applied in small doses and with great caution, most effective when it steers toward a viable (and ethical) path to pride and inclusion.
3. Anonymity. Makes accountability difficult to sustain.
4. Feelings of injustice. Employees will work harder and be more loyal if you take time to explain why your actions were necessary, how the changes will unfold, and treat them with dignity along the way.
5. Feelings of helplessness. The key is to convince them that regardless of what has happened before, there are steps they can take now to make things better.

## Did This, Not That: Imagine You've Already Succeeded (or Failed)

* The best leaders treat scaling as a marathon, gaining insights from every accomplishment and setback, driven by the nagging feeling that things are never quite good enough -- a "relentless restlessness" where, little by little, people keep getting better at what they do.

### Pre-Mortem

* Helps overcome blind spots by providing some psychological distancing and dampening optimism.
* Easier to imagine detailed causes for a single outcome, than what possible outcomes might be and how they might have occurred.
* Imagining a particular event helps it feel more real and motivates people to devote more attention to explaining it.
* Provides a competition in which members feel accountable for raising obstacles that others haven't.
* Imagine you succeeded (or failed) is particularly useful for "go, no-go" decisions.
* Beyond this it can be helpful to focus on feasibility and viability.

1. Split into two groups. Task one group with imagining wild success and the other with unmitigated disaster.
2. Each individual should work independently and generate reasons, or better yet, write a story, about why the succes or failure occured. Be as detailed as possible and identify causes, even if they might not be mentioned normally for fear of being impolitic.
3. Compile the responses and share more broadly, looking for changes in the plan to bolster it based on insights gleaned from the process

## Did This, Not That (Lessons Revisted From the Future)

1. We Started Where We Were, Not Where We Hoped to Arrive
2. We Did Scaling, Not Just Swarming - Enthusiasm and awareness are a good starting point, but they are not enough. Training is often central to scaling efforts.
3. We Used Our Mindset as a Guide, Not as the Answer to Every Question and Problem - You need mindsets, but you should never stop asking hwen it might be time to cast them aside.
4. We Used Constraints That Channelled, Rather Than Derailed, Ingenuity and Effort - Scaling flows more quickly and easily with a small set of ironclad constraints they can rarely, if ever, crash through. Short lists keep cognitive load low and direct attention to pressing challenges.
5. Our Hierarchy Squelched Unnecessary Friction, Rather Than Creating and Spreading It - Hierarchy should be used sparingly, to eliminate needless friction and complexity (not burden employees), and ultimately to build a better organizational operating system.
6. We Worked with People We Respected, Not Necessarilly Our Friends - Diverse groups have diverse networks. Some of the most effective teams "fight as if they are right, and listen as if they are wrong".
7. Accountability Prevailed, Free Riding and Other Bad Behaviors Failed - When doing nothing is safer, or selfish behaviours are encouraged, people thing of "me" rather than "we or us". On the other hand, if everyone feels obligated to do the right thing, each person will feel compelled to be both a teacher and a student -- to share and learn as much as possible from others.
