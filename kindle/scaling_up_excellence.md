# Scaling Up Excellence

Scaling Up Excellence is about the challenge of spreading constructive beliefs and behaviors from the few to the many.

## Key Lessons

1. Rational arguments are rarely sufficient to provoke action. Success hinges on stoking emotions that fuel tangible, desirable actions.
2. Scaling is more than just the Problem of More, it is constantly seeking and implementing better ways of thinking and acting across old and new corners of the system.
3. People adept at scaling excellence talk and act as if they are knee-deep in a manageable mess.
4. Scaling starts and ends with individuals, and success depends on the will and skill of people at every level.

## Ground War

* Effective scaling depends on believing and living a shared mindset (sacreds/taboos) throughout your group, division, or organization.
* Scaling requires grinding it out, and pressing each person, team, group, division, or arganization to make one small change after another in what they believe, feel, or do.
* As expansion occurs, the goal isn't maintaining, it is working day after day to make the system better.
* Sustaining and constantly improving mindset is like being in a high-maintenance personal relationship. Constant vigilance is required.
* Mindset and excellence are rarely lost all at once. It usually happens via many small, seemingly innocent moves that chip away at what is sacred, transforming it into hollow and hypocritical words.

1. Spread a Mindset, Not Just a Footprint - Focus on what is sacred and what is taboo. Focus on behaviors that demonstrate and reinforce, and remain constantly vigilant.
2. Engage All the Senses - Look for ways to provide subtle queues toward mindset, as these reinforce without increasing cognitive load. In particular, spot and remove "dissonant details" that clash with mindset.
3. Link Short-Term Realities to Long Term Dreams
4. Accelerate Accountability - try to design a system where responsibility is constant, strong, and embraced by everyone (so slackers, energy suckers, and selfish soloists have no place to hide).
5. Fear the Clusterfug - Combination of Illusion (that things will be easy), Impatience (rolling things out before they are ready), and Incompetence (deciders lack knowledge/skill, which transforms others into incompetents due to lack of support). This trifecta causes things to fail big and late, rather than early and cheap.
6. Scaling Requires Both Addition and Subtraction - Keep an eye out for what "got us here, but won't get us there" and strip it away.
7. Slow Down to Scale Faster -- and Better -- Down the Road - Slow down when you don't know enough, risks are high, or you are stuck.

## Buddhism vs Catholocism

* Catholicism aims to replicate preordained beliefs and practices. Buddhism shares a mindset, but leaves specifics to person and place.
* Beware the "replica trap", where you believe that the same results can be acheived by doing the same thing all over the place.
* Not a binary decision, each approach is better in different situations.
* Partnerships generate Buddhist pressures, because it is hard to maintain purity with additional inputs/context.
* Sometimes to spread footprint faster and further, you may need to sacrifice short-term excellence. Unfortunately learning in this context can also suffer/lag.
* It can help to focus on a short list of non-negotiables as "guard rails", and leave flexibility outside these bounds. Can be especially helpful if plagued by excessive standardization and replication. After selecting guardrails, tell and (especially) show everyone that crashing through them has unpleasant consequences, but otherwise give flexibility.

### Signs of Overkill

1. Do You Suffer from Delusions of Uniqueness? - Keep an eye out for areas that really do not gain value from being different.
2. Do You Have a Successful Template to Use as a Prototype? - Even if you do, keep an eye out for evidence that it may need revision/tweaks.
3. Will Bolstering Buddhism Generate Crucial Understanding, Commitment, and Innovation? - Giving flexibility also gives ownership and accountability.

## Hot Causes, Cool Solutions: Stoking the Scaling Engine

* The best place to start is anyplace you can. Arguments persist about starting with belief or behavior, but the two are mutually reinforcing.
* Hot causes trigger attention, emotional energy, and commitment. The way they are communicated matters as much as the content, nonverbal behaviors are especially crucial. Emotions are contagious.
* The cause alone will not be enough, without a solution, commitment and accountability will wane.
* Mindset should be treated like a compass or GPS. It points you in the right direction most of the time, but sometimes can run into obstacles or cause you to miss your destination.

1. Name the Problem - the name should provide a compact summary that helps people understand the challeng, explain it, and guides them toward cool solutions.
2. Name the Enemy - the cause is amped up if you can point to an external threat to bolster solidarity and cooperation
3. Do It Where All Can See - people are more likely to stick to things the commit to publicly
4. Breach Assumptions - breaching experiments can reveal contours of unwritten social rules
5. Create Gateway Experiences and On-Ramps - onboarding experiences that ease adoption can go a long way.
6. New Rituals, Better Rituals - rituals can create or reinforce mindset, especially when performed publically, by all, and repeatedly. Interaction rituals in particular can be good to focus on.
7. Lean on People Who Can't Leave Well Enough Alone - focus, at least initially, on those who jump at the chance to live the new mindset.

### Change Resistors

1. Routine seekers, agreeing with statements like "I would rather be bored than surprised."
2. Become tense, stressed, and uncomfortable at the prospect of dealing with new challenges and chores
3. Short-term thinkers, agreeing with statements like "When someone presses me to change something, I tend to resist even if I think the change may ultimately benefit me."
4. Prone to cognitive rigidity, agreeing with statements like "once I come to a conclusion, I am not likely to change my mind."

## Cut Cognitive Load: But Deal with Necessary Complexity

* "Rules, tools, and fools." make every organization tick.
* As organizations grow, metrics, procedures, and chores have a tendency to pilu up until capacity and will power to do the right thing are diminished.
* Bigger teams help each other less, because it becomes difficult to maintain that many relationships and coordinate with that many people.
* Research (J. Richard Hackman) concludes that optimal group size is 4-6. Problems seems to grow exponentially as team size grows.
* Well-crafted rules and processes create predictability, reduce conflict, facilitate coordination and reduce cognitive load by providing proven responses to routine situations (instead of needing to reinvent the wheel).
* Heirarchy clarifies who makes decisions (and who does not), when decisions are final, and many other details like wher to sit, who talks more/less, what to wear, when meetings start and end.
* Be wary of "coordination neglect"/"scaling fallacy", which comes with the underestimation of the increasing percentage of time, resources, and staff required to orchestract action as an organization expands.
* As organizations grow, heirarchy/process/structure become necessary to prevent chaos, but give ground grudingly. Try to understand when you are at the Goldilocks "just right" level, vs when you can wait a bit longer.

1. Subtraction as a Way of Life - Ruthlessly spot and remove crummy/useless rules, tools, and fools that clog up the works and cloud people's minds. Move from simplistic, to complex, to profoundly simple.
2. Make People Squirm - If you aren't upsetting people while subtracting, you aren't pushing hard enough. Subtraction is jarring because humans like familiar and dislike unfamiliar.
3. Bring on the Load Busters: Subtraction by Addition - Not only do we have poor memories, we tend to ruminate/act-upon trivial and useless distractions, making it hard to focus on clrucial concerns. Focus on affordances to help focus on what matters. ie firefighter hand-off scripts
4. Divide and Conquer - Look for opportunities to provide challenges that require cooperation and a sense of being on the same team.
5. Bolster Collective Brainpower: Increase Cognitive Capacity Instead of Adding More People - Keeping teams at least partially intact and stripping away irrelevant things help.

## The People Who Propel Scaling: Building Organizations Where "I Own the Place and the Place Owns Me"

* Scaling depends on both bringing in the right talent and having people who feel compelled to act in the organizations best interests ("accountability") and who press one another to act that way too.
* When people put their own needs first, excellence suffers because they feel no obligation to mentor newcomers or help calleaguse do great work.
* Focus less on hiring fully formed superstars and more on selecting promising people, then teaching and motivating them.
* Employees should act "like they own the place", but also feel like the "place owns them." Ownership encourages them to push themselves and others toward excellence, whereas being "owned" means expecting, accepting, and working hard to meet high standards of others.
* Scaling stumbles when too little effort is made to mesh talents, develop skills, and providing incentives to pass along tricks of the trade and pitch in to help finish projects.

1. Squelch Free Riding - Even a few free-riders can spread selfishness and greed like wildfire. Highlight ownership and encourage spreading it to others.
2. Inject Pride and Righteous Anger - When people feel proud about scaling something great, angry at those who might impeed their effort, or both, they think and worry less about selfish desires and concerns.
3. Bring in Guild-Prone Leaders - Leaders prone to guilt are especially likely to display concern for others and put the greater good ahead of their personal goals and glory.
4. "I'll Be Watching You": Use Substle Cues to Prime Accountability - Provide other reminders that use all five senses.
5. Create the Right "Gene Pool" - Experiences and training are crucial to spreading the right beliefs, behaviors, and skills.
6. Use Other Organizations as Your HR Department - If you can find quality organizations that share values, hiring from them can be an effective training shortcut.
7. Hire People Prewired to Fit Your Mindset - Those who already share similar values will need less training and adjustment.

## Connect People and Cascade Excellence: Using Social Bonds to Spread the Right Mindset

* Scaling hinges on discovering (or creating) pockets of excellence and connecting those who have it, their ideas and expertise, to others.
* After this initial pocket, the existing pockets can be leaned on to teach us and others, and these groups can lead further recruitment efforts.
* It is important to connect diverse groups, not just more people. Diverse groups will have more varied interconnections, and when broader groups are involved early adopters will be less worried about being outliers or taken advantage of.
* Seek out master multipliers, who couple deep knowledge and enthusiasm with an ability to find others te help them fuel further spread of ideas.
* Emotions are contagious, focus on finding people who engergize others to aide early spread of mindset.
* Activate Dormant Connections: Remind people of the connection. Channel those feeling stoward action. Make it easy for these recruits to live excellence and spread it on.
* Consider gamifying things. ie using a stock-market game where people can propose ideas, invest, etc to help identify ideas.
* Once is not enough, one exposure is rarely enough for beliefs and behaviors to be adopted. One is not enough, not every tool is right for every job, nor are they mutually exclusive, a blend of tools often works best.
* Create shared rhythms, which help people develop bonds.
* Connectors must also snip or weaken links that create tunnel vision or distorted and dangerous views of reality.

1. The Top-Down Approach - Heirarchies can often help start a cascade, but for more complex and controversial changes it is often not enough.
2. Broadcast Your Message Out to One and All - Help remind people and spread the word, but often need one-on-one support to really recruit people.
3. Surround Them: Have the Many Teach the Few - An effective - if inefficient - way is to take one person, or a small group, and embed them in a larger group that already lives the mindset.
4. One on One: The Power of Pairs - One of the most successful scaling tools is to pair off people, so that one can "topple" the next. Critical not just for teaching new ideas, but also for persuading others to support and smoothing implementation. Seek out supporters and fence-sitters, avoid resistors.
5. From the Few to the Many - Find ways to get existing converts to engage/partner on existing teams, while also teaching and spreading their mindset.
6. Brokers: Bridging Disconnected Islands - Fill holes between disconnected groups by transfering information, expertise, ideas, and influence from those who have it to those who need it.
7. Create Crossroads Where People Connect - Bazaarlike settings enable people to build new connections and strengthen old ones -- largely through one-on-one interactions.

### Leaders as Connectors: Three Litmus Tests

1. Ask diverse members about key aspects of strategy, operations, policies, philosophy, and pressing problems. If they give inconsistent or clashing answers, it is a sign of trouble, especially if they don't have knowledge or interest in the other answers.
2. Is there evidence of a lot of one-on-one interactions, or conversely, evidence that there is little if any interaction?
3. Have you done everything possible to make sure that the ties that bind you don't also blind you?

## Bad Is Stronger Than Good: Clearing the Way for Excellence

* Destructive behaviors of just about every stripe -- selfishness, nastiness, anxiety, laziness, dishonesty, etc -- pack a bigger wallop than constructive behaviors.
* Several reasons help explain why people who witness bad behavior don't move to stop it:
  * Ambiguity
  * "Diffusion of responsibility" or bystander effect
  * Because no one else is helping, they may worry about disapproval if they jump in.
* To counter bystander inaction:
  * Make sure each person feel personally obligated to reverse or repari problems, no matter what others around them do or don't do.
  * Make sure everyone knows and agrees on what bad behavior looks like. Err on the side of being explicit, loud, and repetitive.
  * Make sure bad behaviour does now become "normalized", ie necessary evil, inevitable/unstoppable, expected, accepted, or even good naughty fun.
* Destructive mindsets often emerge when the easiest (or only) way to get well-meaning incenctives is to do something bad.

1. Nip It in the Bud - Even a little bit of bad can signal that no one is watching, no one cares, and no one will stop people from doing even worse things.
2. Get Rid of the Bad Apples - One of the most reliable fixes is to remove the bad apples (note sometimes bad apples in one context are good apples in another).
3. Plumbing Before Poetry - Getting people to focus on the small, mundane, and sometimes gritty details of organizational life is an effective path for eliminating the negative.
4. Adequecy Before Excellence - Customer loyalty has much more to do with keeping plain/vanilla promises than dazzling them.
5. Use the Cool Kids (and Adults) to Define and Squelch Bad Behavior - Recruit the most admired and connect people, teach them what "bad" looks like, and encourage them to stop being perpetrators.
6. Kill the Thrill - Bad can sometimes feel good. Focus on removing prestige from the bad behavior, and look for other incentives or disincentives.
7. Time Shifting: From Current to Future Selves - Sometimes you can break bad cycles by getting people to think about the person they hope to be, rather than just the person they are now. You can encourage this shift by making ambitious goals more vivid and emotionally compelling.
8. Focus on the Best Times, the Worst Times, and the End - No matter how good or bad an experience is, or how long it lasts, our judgement is disproportionally shaped by the best and worst moments and if it ended well or badly (Daniel Kahneman's "peak-end rule"). Remember and focus on this, for instance as it relates to employee careers.

### Warning Signs: Five Dangerous Feelings

1. Fear of taking responsibility, especially if it seems safer to do nothing, or something bad, than the right thing. Silence is one of the most reliable signs of thsi.
2. Fear of being ostracized, or socially excluded. Best applied in small doses and with great caution, most effective when it steers toward a viable (and ethical) path to pride and inclusion.
3. Anonymity. Makes accountability difficult to sustain.
4. Feelings of injustice. Employees will work harder and be more loyal if you take time to explain why your actions were necessary, how the changes will unfold, and treat them with dignity along the way.
5. Feelings of helplessness. The key is to convince them that regardless of what has happened before, there are steps they can take now to make things better.

## Did This, Not That: Imagine You've Already Succeeded (or Failed)

* The best leaders treat scaling as a marathon, gaining insights from every accomplishment and setback, driven by the nagging feeling that things are never quite good enough -- a "relentless restlessness" where, little by little, people keep getting better at what they do.

### Pre-Mortem

* Helps overcome blind spots by providing some psychological distancing and dampening optimism.
* Easier to imagine detailed causes for a single outcome, than what possible outcomes might be and how they might have occurred.
* Imagining a particular event helps it feel more real and motivates people to devote more attention to explaining it.
* Provides a competition in which members feel accountable for raising obstacles that others haven't.
* Imagine you succeeded (or failed) is particularly useful for "go, no-go" decisions.
* Beyond this it can be helpful to focus on feasibility and viability.

1. Split into two groups. Task one group with imagining wild success and the other with unmitigated disaster.
2. Each individual should work independently and generate reasons, or better yet, write a story, about why the succes or failure occured. Be as detailed as possible and identify causes, even if they might not be mentioned normally for fear of being impolitic.
3. Compile the responses and share more broadly, looking for changes in the plan to bolster it based on insights gleaned from the process

## Did This, Not That (Lessons Revisted From the Future)

1. We Started Where We Were, Not Where We Hoped to Arrive
2. We Did Scaling, Not Just Swarming - Enthusiasm and awareness are a good starting point, but they are not enough. Training is often central to scaling efforts.
3. We Used Our Mindset as a Guide, Not as the Answer to Every Question and Problem - You need mindsets, but you should never stop asking hwen it might be time to cast them aside.
4. We Used Constraints That Channelled, Rather Than Derailed, Ingenuity and Effort - Scaling flows more quickly and easily with a small set of ironclad constraints they can rarely, if ever, crash through. Short lists keep cognitive load low and direct attention to pressing challenges.
5. Our Hierarchy Squelched Unnecessary Friction, Rather Than Creating and Spreading It - Hierarchy should be used sparingly, to eliminate needless friction and complexity (not burden employees), and ultimately to build a better organizational operating system.
6. We Worked with People We Respected, Not Necessarilly Our Friends - Diverse groups have diverse networks. Some of the most effective teams "fight as if they are right, and listen as if they are wrong".
7. Accountability Prevailed, Free Riding and Other Bad Behaviors Failed - When doing nothing is safer, or selfish behaviours are encouraged, people thing of "me" rather than "we or us". On the other hand, if everyone feels obligated to do the right thing, each person will feel compelled to be both a teacher and a student -- to share and learn as much as possible from others.

# Scaling Up Excellence: Getting to More Without Settling for Less by Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao
- Scaling Up Excellence tackles a challenge that confronts every leader and organization—spreading constructive beliefs and behavior from the few to the many. (107)
- Scaling well hinges on making the right trade-offs between mandating that new people and places become perfect clones of some original model (a “Catholic” approach) versus encouraging local variation, experimentation, and customization (a “Buddhist” approach). (145)
- The same lesson popped up each time: just making a rational argument about why people ought to spread some form of excellence was rarely sufficient to provoke them into action. Skilled leaders found ways to stoke emotions that fueled tangible and desirable actions. (153)
- Our second big lesson is that scaling entails more than the Problem of More. (161)
- It means constantly seeking and implementing better ways of thinking and acting across old and new corners of the system. (171)
- Our third big lesson is that people who are adept at scaling excellence talk and act as if they are knee-deep in a manageable mess. (172)
- The fourth big lesson is that scaling starts and ends with individuals—success depends on the will and skill of people at every level of an organization. (194)
- “Start with yourself, where you are right now, and with what you have and can get right now.” (232)
- IT’S A GROUND WAR, NOT JUST AN AIR WAR (3)
- Going Slower to Scale Faster (and Better) Later (3)
- Scaling requires grinding it out, and pressing each person, team, group, division, or organization to make one small change after another in what they believe, feel, or do. (4)
- As they expand, their goal isn’t just to maintain the status quo. The team works day after day to make their system better. (5)
- 1. Spread a Mindset, Not Just a Footprint (7)
- Effective scaling depends on believing and living a shared mindset throughout your group, division, or organization. (7)
- Bootcamp also helps Facebook scale up talent because it enables mentors to “stick a toe in the management water.” It helps engineers discover if they enjoy mentoring and leading others. And Facebook executives get useful hints about whether employees are management material. (11)
- Finally, sustaining and constantly improving an organization’s mindset is like being in a high-maintenance personal relationship. Constant vigilance is required. (13)
- The key lesson? An organization rarely loses a healthy mindset and the resulting excellence all at once. It usually happens via a series of small and seemingly innocent moves that chip away at sacred convictions, eventually transforming those beliefs into hollow and hypocritical words. (14)
- 2. Engage All the Senses (14)
- Mindsets are spread and sustained by subtle cues that activate all the senses. (14)
- Kricorian emphasized that, when it comes to small cues, it is especially crucial to spot and remove “dissonant details” that clash with the desired mindset. (16)
- 3. Link Short-Term Realities to Long-Term Dreams (17)
- 4. Accelerate Accountability (20)
- Accountability means that an organization is packed with people who embody and protect excellence (even when they are tired, overburdened, and distracted), who work vigorously to spread it to others, and who spot, help, critique, and (when necessary) push aside colleagues who fail to live and spread it. The trick—and it is a difficult trick—is to design a system where this tug of responsibility is constant, strong, and embraced by everyone, and where slackers, energy suckers, and selfish soloists have no place to hide. (20)
- 5. Fear the Clusterfug (24)
- Definitions like this one came even closer: “the state of affairs resulting from too many staffers and not enough trained staffers on a project.” (24)
- Illusion: Decision makers believe that what they are scaling up is far better and easier to spread than the facts warrant. (25)
- Impatience: Decision makers believe that what they are scaling is so good and easy to spread that they rush to roll it out before it is ready, they are ready, and the organization is ready. (25)
- Incompetence: Decision makers lack the requisite knowledge and skill about what they are spreading and how to spread it, which in turn transforms otherwise competent people into incompetent ones. (25)
- When these three elements collide, you’ve got a classic clusterfug. This trifecta causes scaling efforts to fail big and late rather than early and cheaply. (25)
- 6. Scaling Requires Both Addition and Subtraction (27)
- As organizations grow larger and older, as the footprint of a program expands, and as the consequences of past actions accumulate, once useful but now unnecessary roles, rules, rituals, red tape, products, and services build up like barnacles on a ship; to make way for excellence to spread, these sources of unnecessary friction must be removed. (28)
- In particular, a hallmark of successful scaling is that leaders remain vigilant about what “got us here but won’t get us there,” as author Marshall Goldsmith would put it. (28)
- 7. Slow Down to Scale Faster—and Better—Down the Road (30)
- As Kahneman suggests, slowing down and thinking about what you are doing and why—shifting to that laborious, reasoned, deliberative, and conscious “System 2” thinking, as Kahneman calls it—is the best defense when “you are in a cognitive minefield”—when you don’t know enough, risks are high, or you are stuck. (31)
- When it comes to scaling, “System 2” thinking requires constant vigilance so that those easy and automatic responses that are hallmarks of “System 1” thinking don’t impair your efforts to spread, sustain, and keep improving excellence. (31)
- BUDDHISM VERSUS CATHOLICISM (33)
- Choosing a Path (33)
- “What is our goal? Is it more like Catholicism, where the aim is to replicate preordained design beliefs and practices? Or is it more like Buddhism, where an underlying mindset guides why people do certain things—but the specifics of what they do can vary wildly from person to person and place to place?” (33)
- the “replica trap,” the misguided belief that “we can accomplish the same result widely by simply doing the same thing all over the place.” (37)
- The challenge, then, isn’t whether it is generally better to lean toward a Catholic or a Buddhist approach. Rather, it is deciding when to move toward one end or the other for a given organization, person, location, or decision point. (40)
- Although there is no magic formula or instant cure that will make the vexing tensions and trade-offs vanish, the best leaders and teams stay on the lookout for signs of overkill. They search for signs of excessive “localization” or “standardization”—signs that it is time to move a little, or a lot, toward the other end of the continuum. We’ve identified three diagnostic questions that can help you detect when a move is wise, which direction to head, and how to make it happen. (40)
- 1. Do You Suffer from Delusions of Uniqueness? (40)
- Scaling depends on people like Dr. Wright, those often unsung heroes who strive to influence the people they encounter every day to embrace better moves and mindsets. (44)
- 2. Do You Have a Successful Template to Use as a Prototype? (44)
- Both the Girl Scouts and Schultz took much care to replicate a complete template that worked elsewhere. Then, when evidence emerged that some elements didn’t travel well, they had the humility and flexibility to remove, revise, and replace them with better solutions. (48)
- 3. Will Bolstering Buddhism Generate Crucial Understanding, Commitment, and Innovation? (48)
- For starters, laboring to create a local translation of a mindset magnifies the feeling that “I own it and it owns me.” (48)
- The role of local “reform ownership” is usually ignored. Yet giving people the power to tailor the template they implement can bolster understanding throughout a team or organization. (48)
- As renowned psychologist Kurt Lewin said, “If you want truly to understand something, try to change it.” (49)
- Local ownership also creates commitment because the adjustments that locals decide to make will help determine success or failure; such responsibility—and the justified credit and blame that often go with it—fuel the feeling that a scaling effort is “mine” or “ours.” (49)
- Tilting toward Buddhism is especially useful when you have the right mindset in your organization or project but don’t yet have a complete template that has worked elsewhere. (49)
- Alone Versus Together (51)
- Take the choice between going it alone versus working with partners. A partner can provide you with resources, expertise, and the ability to reach more people and establish more locations, which allows you to create a bigger footprint (and do it faster). But maintaining the purity of some original model is more difficult when your partner has a different history or different ideas, tastes, skills, and information than you have—as they always do. Partnerships generate Buddhist pressures. (52)
- More Versus Better (54)
- To spread your footprint faster and further, it is sometimes worth sacrificing a bit—or a lot—of short-term excellence. (54)
- Unfortunately, learning doesn’t always happen so quickly or well. The burdens of expansion can be enduring, and disastrous, especially when bad assumptions are made about new locations, employees, or customers. (54)
- Despite such cautionary tales, there are still times when a bad imitation of a good solution is far better than nothing or what the organization had before. (55)
- Striking a Balance: Using Guardrails at Kaiser Permanente (56)
- Local leaders still had much leeway in what they did and how they did it. But a short list of “non-negotiables” helped ensure that each rollout was efficient, regions could learn from each other, the integrated system worked properly, and patients and KP staff could learn and use one version rather than eight. (59)
- As KP regional leaders discovered, it was easier, faster, and cheaper to imitate solutions that work elsewhere than to invent something from scratch every time. Liang’s team also enticed these leaders with incentives. Their policy was that, if a region elected to use software that was not common across KP, they would have to make and pay for it themselves, as well as required yearly updates. But if they adopted software that was standard throughout KP, then updates would be made and paid for by the national organization. (61)
- Steering rather than forcing people toward change also meant that KP’s people felt more free to form their own opinions. (61)
- Finally, the guardrail strategy offers a promising middle ground for scaling efforts that are plagued with excessive standardization and replication. (64)
- The challenge is to strip away as many unnecessary constraints as possible—to select a few crucial guardrails, tell and (especially) show everyone that crashing through such barriers produces unpleasant consequences—but otherwise allow people to take the paths that they believe are best. (64)
- HOT CAUSES, COOL SOLUTIONS (67)
- Stoking the Scaling Engine (67)
- Kali’s story was a “hot cause.” It triggered attention, emotional energy, and commitment among our students. (68)
- where is the best place to start a scaling effort? Our research suggests that the answer is anyplace you can. (69)
- While arguments will persist over whether it is most effective or logical to first change beliefs or behavior, the two strategies are mutually reinforcing. (70)
- The key is creating and fueling a virtuous circle. (70)
- The way that advocates communicate a hot cause is as important as its content; nonverbal behaviors are especially crucial. (70)
- Emotions are contagious. (70)
- When it comes to getting people to rally behind a hot cause, the key is creating experiences that generate “communities of feeling.” (70)
- It is harder to break a commitment when you have proclaimed it publicly (rather than just announcing it to one or two people). (71)
- Simi did not dwell on the skepticism or looming obstacles. Instead, she took a “do, then speak” approach: she asked the group to humor her and spend just one day mapping out—with Post-it notes—the steps required to shut down and then reopen JetBlue’s Kennedy operations when bad weather hit. She also asked them to put a pink Post-it at every juncture where the system needed to be changed. (75)
- No matter where you start, if people continue to talk and talk about some hot cause or mindset but fail to enact cool solutions, commitment will wane, and accountability—that pressure to live the mindset and to insist that others do too—will be weak. (77)
- Remember the ancient proverb: “What I hear I forget, what I see I remember, and what I do I understand.” (77)
- These are symptoms of what Sutton and Jeffrey Pfeffer call “the smart-talk trap,” where people treat planning, conferences, corporate retreats, brainstorming, storytelling, and other kinds of talk as substitutes (rather than motivation) for action. (78)
- To scale up excellence, leaders and teams need to keep finding ways to bolster belief in a hot cause (and the underlying mindset), persuade others to live that mindset (whether they believe in it or not), or, better yet, work both belief and behavior angles at the same time. (79)
- 1. Name the Problem (79)
- The right name provides a compact summary that helps people understand a challenge, explain it to others, and guides them to cool solutions. (79)
- He made these Thursday meetings a safe place to share information (including about failures and setbacks) and to ask executives from other departments for help. (81)
- 2. Name the Enemy (81)
- The hot cause is amped up by pointing to some vile outside enemy that people must join together to defeat. Research on sports teams, combat teams, corporations, political movements, and warring countries shows that, when people feel threatened by an external threat, solidarity and cooperation usually shoot up. (81)
- 3. Do It Where All Can See (84)
- Persuading people to take “public” actions that demonstrate a commitment to a mindset or a belief is a powerful means for stoking the behavior-belief cycle. (85)
- 4. Breach Assumptions (86)
- Breaching experiments reveal the contours of unwritten social rules. (86)
- 5. Create Gateway Experiences and On-Ramps (88)
- Discussions about the table also served as a stepping-stone that helped the negotiators develop relationships with each other and establish useful precedents about making decisions and compromises. (88)
- 6. New Rituals, Better Rituals (90)
- Rituals can serve as on-ramps for creating or reinforcing a mindset—especially when they are performed in front of others, done by all, and repeated over and over. Such public displays of commitment are difficult to revoke or reverse, and as people perform them over and over they become ingrained habits. (90)
- Similarly, when a new leader or team takes charge, they can help modify the reigning mindset by changing the interaction rituals. (91)
- In one faculty group we are part of, a new leader wanted to change the existing norms so that all members’ voices were heard—not just those of a few high-status and overbearing faculty. So he started a ritual where—when an important decision was to be made—each of the thirty or so members was limited to a short statement (under a minute). He called on the most junior people in the room first and worked his way up to the most senior (and didn’t allow people to interrupt). (91)
- As Park’s actions suggest, there are several intertwined ways that leaders can re-engage potential supporters. (192)
- First, remind them of the dormant connection. (192)
- Next, channel those feelings toward action; gently entice and prod people to rekindle old connections and create new ones, (192)
- Third, make it easy for “renewed recruits” to live the excellence you aim to spread, and in turn, to pass it along—to (193)
- Connect Everybody: Turn Work into a Game That People Like to Play (194)
- Reeves and other “gamification” advocates assert that workplaces would be more fun and effective if the principles for designing computer games were applied to designing organizations. (195)
- To kill them off, many firms use “murder boards,” committees that not only kill ideas but subject the people who propose them to withering criticism, even ridicule. Colleagues who witness such ugliness tend to keep their ideas to themselves lest they suffer the same fate. (196)
- This internal stock market has three categories: 1. “Savings Bonds,” ideas that could save the company money or increase efficiency 2. “Bow Jones,” ideas that use existing technology to create new products or services 3. “SPAZDAQ,” ideas about new technologies (196)
- After an employee submits a new idea, it is quickly and lightly screened by a senior engineer and listed in Mutual Fun. Every employee gets $10,000 of play opinion money to invest in their colleagues’ “idea stocks.” (197)
- The game also enables employees to discuss ideas and volunteer to work on them (on their own time). Stocks that attract more play money and volunteers move up in value; the firm invests “Adventure Capital” (real money) in the top fifteen stocks. (197)
- Stocks that don’t attract investors are delisted but often spark new proposals. (197)
- When an idea saves money or produces revenue, creators and implementers share the gains—with a greater percentage going to implementers. (197)
- Making Nets Work (198)
- Our first rule is Once is not enough because beliefs and behaviors do not spread like contagious diseases—one exposure is rarely enough to infect people. (198)
- Our second rule, One is not enough, follows from the first. Each tool isn’t right for every scaling challenge. Nor are all tools mutually exclusive. Using a blend of two or more is usually better than relying on just one. (199)
- Here is our menu of seven tools for getting nets to work. (199)
- 1. The Top-Down Approach (199)
- Hierarchies come in handy for creating a domino chain reaction that starts from the top and cascades down the pecking order. (199)
- But for more complex and controversial changes, command-and-demand often isn’t enough. (200)
- 2. Broadcast Your Message Out to One and All (200)
- Webinars, brochures, mailings, websites, and gatherings where senior executives make speeches to employees are part of many scaling efforts. (200)
- But such “air war” tactics alone are rarely enough to persuade people to join on and help expand a movement. (200)
- Creating those strong ties required ground war tactics: personal e-mails, phone calls, and especially face-to-face interaction. (201)
- 3. Surround Them: Have the Many Teach the Few (201)
- One of the most effective—if inefficient—ways to spread new behaviors and beliefs is to take one person, or a small team, and embed them among large numbers of people who already eat, live, and breathe the mindset that you want them to embrace. (201)
- 4. One on One: The Power of Pairs (202)
- This tool is core to most successful scaling efforts: nearly all depend at least partly on dyads where each “domino” topples the next. (202)
- Zynga, which makes “social” Web-based games such as FarmVille, has a policy that encourages managers to mentor direct reports: you can’t get a promotion to the next level unless you “grow your own replacement.” (202)
- Pairings are also critical for spreading change: not just for teaching new ideas and skills but also for persuading others to support and smooth implementation. (202)
- When it comes to one-on-one influence, focus on supporters and fence-sitters. Try to pair the “persuaders” on your scaling team with powerful people who already trust and admire them. Beware of pairing up with resisters. (204)
- 5. From the Few to the Many (204)
- She called this the “Trojan Horse effect” because, once they got a “seat at the table” and worked with a business’s leadership team, these experienced innovators did what came naturally to them—using design thinking to solve problems. The connect-and-cascade process kicked in: as they helped colleagues in other disciplines solve problems, not only did these colleagues come to value the innovators’ knowledge and skills, but many learned and began applying the methods themselves. (205)
- Kotchka discovered a related lesson about implanting “Trojan Horses”: putting just one designer in a business didn’t work. They felt lonely and didn’t have like-minded coworkers to bounce ideas off and serve as allies. (205)
- The few must use their grit and skill to teach and convert others, who, in turn, start the domino chain of goodness in motion. (205)
- 6. Brokers: Bridging Disconnected Islands (206)
- When a pocket of people have got something good, but no path connects them and their knowledge to others who need it, excellence can’t spread. (206)
- Brokers “fill” these holes and transfer information, expertise, ideas, and influence between those who have it and those who need it. (206)
- Kelley’s masterful brokering. We’ve boiled down his efforts to five key elements: (208)
- 1. He is curious about strangers and their ideas (208)
- 2. He lives and breathes the mindset but isn’t obnoxious about it. (209)
- 3. He has strong opinions, weakly held. (209)
- 4. He listens and learns. (209)
- 5. He convenes, introduces, and connects. (209)
- David Kelley is skilled and relentless in his efforts to link people, teams, and organizations that need each other—but hadn’t known that before. (210)
- 7. Create Crossroads Where People Connect (210)
- When it comes to scaling excellence in and across organizations, bazaarlike settings enable people to build new connections and strengthen old ones—largely through one-on-one interactions. (210)
- Create a Common Heartbeat (212)
- Recent studies show that when people share rhythms with others they develop stronger emotional bonds and are more likely to pitch in for the common good. (212)
- When people share the same daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal rhythms, connections among them form faster and stay stronger. The people trust each other more deeply, and coordination becomes easier because they see and experience the world in the same way. (213)
- Not only do these daily meetings strengthen connections in the team, they also mean that members have a constant supply of fresh information about the challenges that Reily faces and solutions that are and are not working. (213)
- 7. Lean on People Who Can’t Leave Well Enough Alone (91)
- Picking people who will jump at the chance to live the new mindset—and sidelining or even firing those who resist such change—is often the first step to scaling up a new mindset. (92)
- Four hallmarks of “change resisters” emerged from this research: 1. “Routine seekers” who agree with statements like “I would rather be bored than surprised.” 2. People who have strong negative emotional reactions to change, those who become “tense,” “stressed,” and “uncomfortable” at the prospect of doing or dealing with new challenges and chores. 3. Short-term thinkers, those who agree with statements like “When someone presses me to change something, I tend to resist even if I think the change may ultimately benefit me.” 4. People who are “prone to cognitive rigidity,” who agree that “once I come to a conclusion, I am not likely to change my mind.” (92)
- These are the kinds of people that you ought to exclude from your scaling effort, at least in the early days. They will slow the effort, and, worse still, their fear and foot-dragging can spread to others like a contagious disease. Instead, you want people who get bored with stable routines, don’t stress out—or, better yet, take pleasure—from new challenges, have a penchant for long-term thinking, and are prone to change their minds when new information comes along. You want people who—even when they express skepticism or outright disbelief—still can’t resist the temptation to try something new, to make things a bit better for themselves and others, and who don’t freak out and freeze up when confronted with the confusion and dead ends that are inevitable as we learn new ways of thinking and acting. (93)
- The art of scaling up excellence is very much about knowing when to create a tight connection between poetry and plumbing versus when to stretch, flex, or even set aside your most precious beliefs. (95)
- A mindset should be treated like a compass or the global positioning system in your car or on your phone. It is something that points you in the right direction most of the time. But you can’t follow it blindly; otherwise, every now and then, you will plow into obstacles that you should have steered around or miss your destination. (96)
- CUT COGNITIVE LOAD (98)
- But Deal with Necessary Complexity (98)
- “Rules, tools, and fools.” The University of Michigan’s Robert Kahn once joked that these key ingredients make every organization tick. (98)
- As organizations expand and mature, rather than rationing or subtracting load, leaders and teams often pile on so many metrics, procedures, and chores that people lose the capacity and willpower to do the right things. (99)
- As Office Depot discovered, the more tasks that people do, the worse they tend to perform each one. (100)
- As teams get bigger, individual performance suffers. (101)
- Employees in bigger teams gave each other less support and help because it was harder to maintain so many social relationships and to coordinate with more people. (102)
- After devoting nearly fifty years to studying group effectiveness, the late J. Richard Hackman concluded that, for most tasks, the best size is four to six: “My rule of thumb is that no work team should have membership in the double digits.… The number of performance problems a team encounters increases exponentially as team size increases.” (102)
- To us, this means that the key challenges are how to add rules, tools, and people without creating bloated and overbearing bureaucracies, filled with overloaded and irresponsible people. (107)
- Well-crafted rules and processes create predictability, reduce conflict, facilitate coordination, and reduce cognitive load because people (often with help from computers) are armed with proven responses to routine situations—rather than having to reinvent the wheel each time. (107)
- Hierarchies clear up confusion about who makes decisions and who does not, when decisions are final, and thousands of details such as where to sit, who talks more and less, what to wear, and when meetings start and end. (108)
- 1. Subtraction as a Way of Life (110)
- Leaders and teams that spread excellence act the same way, ruthlessly spotting and removing crummy or useless rules, tools, and fools that clog up the works and cloud people’s minds. (110)
- Psychologist William Schutz observed that “understanding evolves through three phases: simplistic, complex, and profoundly simple.” As people who scale excellence learn what works and what doesn’t, and what is most and least crucial, they move toward “profound simplicity,” where much of the once necessary complexity—tike scaffolding—is in the way and can be removed. (115)
- 2. Make People Squirm (117)
- We have a rule of thumb for practicing subtraction: if you aren’t upsetting people, you aren’t pushing hard enough. (117)
- Subtraction often entails removing the old and familiar and replacing it with something new and strange (or nothing at all). Subtraction is jarring because we humans have positive emotional reactions to the familiar and negative reactions to the unfamiliar. (117)
- 3. Bring on the Load Busters: Subtraction by Addition (119)
- Not only do human beings have lousy memories, but the things that we do recall, ruminate over, and act on are often trivial and useless—“colored rags” that clog our consciousness, sapping our capacity to remember and act on more crucial concerns. (119)
- Some researchers call these affordances; we call them load busters. (119)
- During forest fires, the outgoing crew chief is responsible for five steps during his or her conversation with the incoming chief: 1. Here’s what I think we face. 2. Here’s what I think we should do. 3. Here’s why. 4. Here’s what I think we should keep an eye on. 5. Now talk to me (i.e., tell me if you [a] don’t understand, [b] cannot do it, [c] see something that I do not). (121)
- 4. Divide and Conquer (122)
- But the urge to view people in other groups and departments as enemies to defeat (rather than friends to work and win with) is one that every leader and organization must be vigilant about tamping down. (125)
- Another approach, as we saw at JetBlue, is to give people challenges that require them to cooperate with other groups and departments, which helps create the feeling that “we are all on the same team.” (126)
- 5. Bolster Collective Brainpower: Increase Cognitive Capacity Instead of Adding More People (127)
- The U.S. Strategic Air Command (SAC) mandates that the airplanes carrying nuclear bombs are to be maintained and flown by intact or “hard” teams. (128)
- If you are forming a new team, or fixing an old one, try to bring in at least two or three people who have worked together effectively before. (128)
- But they kept finding that groups with more women performed better on “collective intelligence” tests. Groups with more women typically had superior social sensitivity and thus members cooperated and wove together their talents more effectively. (129)
- These findings dovetail with other studies showing that “making repeated judgments or decisions depletes individuals’ executive function and mental resources,” rendering people prone to simplify, accept the status quo, think less deeply about choices, and perform less well on tasks that “required more mental resources.” (131)
- Give Ground Grudgingly (132)
- Dubbed “coordination neglect” or “the scaling fallacy,” it means that decision makers are prone to underestimate the increasing percentage of time, resources, and staff that are required to orchestrate action as a group or organization expands. (132)
- In short, we advocate “the Goldilocks Theory of Bureaucracy.” Much like the children’s story, scaling requires injecting just enough structure, hierarchy, and process at the right time. The key challenge, then, is knowing when to add more complexity, when it is “just right,” and when to wait a bit longer. (133)
- THE PEOPLE WHO PROPEL SCALING (136)
- Build Organizations Where “I Own the Place and the Place Owns Me” (136)
- The lesson from the IROP project, and other stories and studies here, is that the capacity for effective scaling depends on both bringing in the right talent (people with the right training and skills) and having people who feel compelled to act in the organization’s best interests (“accountability”) and who press one another to act that way too. (139)
- When employees put their needs ahead of clients, colleagues, and the company—whether this results from personality, bad role models, or bad incentives—excellence suffers because they feel no obligation to mentor newcomers or help colleagues do great work. (139)
- Many, perhaps most, organizations that scale effectively get the job done by depending less on hiring fully formed superstars and more on selecting promising people—and then teaching and motivating them to do exceptional work. (142)
- each employee ought to feel and act “like you own the place.” On the other hand, employees ought to feel like the place owns them too. (144)
- A tug of mutual obligation is created because being “owners” entitles and encourages employees to push themselves, peers, bosses, subordinates, suppliers, and sometimes clients to support exceptional performance. And being “owned” means that employees expect, accept, and work hard to meet high standards held and enforced by superiors, peers, clients, and customers. (144)
- The pressures to conform and perform are harder to escape because each worker is beholden to every other team member rather than to a single manager or boss. (145)
- Too many organizations stumble because they devote too little effort to helping people mesh their talents, to developing the skills of employees they hire, and to providing incentives that encourage them to pass along tricks of the trade to colleagues and to pitch in to help one another finish projects. (146)
- Talent x Accountability = Scaling Capacity (150)
- 1. Squelch Free Riding (150)
- When people feel accountable to their colleagues and customers, they feel obliged to expend extra effort and make sacrifices for the greater good. Making this happen, and keeping it going, isn’t easy. (150)
- Olson shows that, even when everyone in the system benefits, it is often rational for each person to contribute nothing, or at least far less than he or she is capable of, because the personal costs of action outweigh the personal benefits. Economists call this the free-rider problem. (151)
- GE evaluates all employees on both their performance and their leadership. Leadership includes supporting the GE culture and other factors that are essential to business success. The five main evaluation categories are external focus, inclusiveness, clear thinking, expertise, and imagination and courage. (152)
- GE employees at all levels are “expected to own the responsibility” for constantly improving their skills and updating how they lead in response to changes in their jobs and the business environment. (153)
- In addition, leadership at GE means encouraging and guiding your peers and the people you manage to take such ownership as well. (153)
- Financial rewards are most effective when they dovetail with hiring and firing practices. (154)
- When even a few people ride on the coattails of colleagues and keep getting away with it, hardworking and unselfish members feel like suckers. When that happens, selfishness and greed can spread like wildfire. (155)
- 2. Inject Pride and Righteous Anger (155)
- When people are surrounded by others who feel and act proud about scaling something great, are angry at others who are—or might—impede their righteous efforts, or experience both feelings at once, they think and worry less about their selfish desires and concerns. And they are also more willing to take difficult, even personally risky, actions for the greater good. (155)
- 3. Bring in Guilt-Prone Leaders (159)
- A 2012 study suggests that, when leaders are prone to feeling guilty, they are especially likely to display concern for others and to put the greater good ahead of their personal goals and glory. (159)
- They feel especially bad about past mistakes and worry constantly about messing up in the future, which they compensate for by being action oriented, constantly taking preventive measures to avoid future mistakes and steps to repair the damage done by their past errors. (159)
- Shame-prone leaders are different: when they make mistakes, they feel sorry for themselves, are filled with and frozen by worries that they are bad people, and run from the messes they make. (159)
- “Guilt proneness predicted emerging leadership even more than did extraversion, a well-known marker of leadership.” (160)
- 4. “I’ll Be Watching You”: Use Subtle Cues to Prime Accountability (162)
- 5. Create the Right “Gene Pool” (163)
- Yet there are limits to treating an organization’s “gene pool” as if human qualities, experience, and skills are fixed. Even when you hire the right people, the experiences and training you provide are crucial for spreading the right beliefs, behaviors, and skills. In other words, the people make the place and the place makes the people! Many organizations use formal programs to “build” the people they need. (165)
- One tried-and-true approach is to rotate “high-potentials” through diverse and increasingly challenging jobs. (165)
- 6. Use Other Organizations as Your HR Department (167)
- 7. Hire People Prewired to Fit Your Mindset (170)
- CONNECT PEOPLE AND CASCADE EXCELLENCE (174)
- Using Social Bonds to Spread the Right Mindset (174)
- The Goal: Domino Chains of Goodness (175)
- As CALL’s success suggests, scaling hinges on discovering (or creating) pockets of excellence and connecting the people who have it, and their ideas and expertise, to others. When all goes well, a chain reaction occurs where excellence flows from one person, team, or place to the next—much like those “domino chains,” where the energy generated by one falling domino creates the energy to topple the next, and then the next, and so on, until all have fallen. (175)
- But we want to underline and expand on a theme that pervades these and other successful scaling efforts: a core team was accountable for ensuring that the right links were made and that the right facts and feelings kept flowing through the right connections in every case. (176)
- We lean heavily on the participants to teach us and others.” (177)
- They had a weekly phone-in “radio-style” program called “Campaign Live,” (177)
- They maintained websites and provided reports and brochures pertinent to every aspect of the campaign, (177)
- But the team’s most important work entailed building networks of hospitals and other medical organizations to help the campaign—and stepping aside once they kicked into gear. (177)
- These “marriages” involved mostly “nodes” and “mentor hospitals.” The seventy “nodes” lifted the administrative burden off IHI; each helped run the campaign in a given region (usually states) or across key specialties (e.g., rural, academic, children). (178)
- In particular, they took charge of recruitment—their goal was to convince every hospital in the state to join the campaign. (178)
- Once McCannon’s team discovered that a hospital was adept in one of these areas, or his team had helped a hospital learn one of these “bundles,” the staff there was recruited to mentor other hospitals. (179)
- Despite its idiosyncrasies, this campaign had two hallmarks of the best scaling efforts. First, as we’ve emphasized, a core team kept the right information, guidance, and motivation flowing in the network. Second, the team continued to find and groom dedicated helpers so that they weren’t burdened with every detail of the “connect and cascade” process. (179)
- “To spread excellence, you need to have some excellence to spread.” (181)
- Whom Do You Connect? (183)
- It’s About Diversity, Not Just Numbers (183)
- Such breadth means that a team is linked to more “nodes” in the organization’s network: to the varied departments, locations, functions, and levels of the pecking order where each member is stationed, as well as to their numerous (and often nonoverlapping) informal friendships, groups, and affiliations. (183)
- Another advantage is that early recruits worry less about being taken advantage of when a broad cross section of the organization is involved. (184)
- is setting them up for failure or embarrassment. The breadth also conveys that what you are scaling can help many or most organization members, not just some specialized group. (184)
- Ironically, diversity also propels scaling because of the power of homogeneity, specifically what psychologists call “similarity-attraction” effects. (184)
- This means that, by stocking an initial scaling team with people who mirror the diversity of the larger organization, once the team’s members embrace and live a mindset, it will cascade more widely than if you had started with people who all looked alike and thought alike, were all from the same place, and all did similar work. (185)
- Look for Master Multipliers (186)
- You need master multipliers, as we call them, as well. Not only do such people have deep knowledge and enthusiasm about what they spread. They are adept at finding others to help them fuel the connect-and-cascade process. (186)
- Bring On the Energizers (189)
- But beliefs and behaviors aren’t the only thing that cascades during Bootcamp. So do emotions, especially positive energy. (189)
- emotion for spreading excellence in social networks. They use simple questions to measure if a person is an “energizer” or a “de-energizer” (189)
- Energizers also have a knack for fully engaging the person in front of them right now, valuing others’ ideas, and creating conditions that enable others to make steady progress. (189)
- Activate Dormant Connections (191)
- Fry concluded that, “It is not the meetings that matter; it is the rhythm that matters.” (215)
- Leaders as Connectors: Three Litmus Tests (215)
- some of the most savvy connectors are skilled at asking and acting on questions that uncover weak or missing links—but wield little formal authority and don’t have powerful carrots and sticks at their disposal. (216)
- You ask diverse members of the team, department, or organization about key aspects of their strategy, operations, policies, philosophy, and pressing problems they face. If they give you inconsistent and clashing answers to your queries, it is a sign of trouble—especially if they seem to have no knowledge or interest in the other answers that their colleagues give you. (216)
- The CFOs suggested a second litmus test, a diagnostic question: Is there more direct evidence that people are having a lot of one-on-one interactions, or conversely, that there is little if any interaction? The CFOs suggested watching what people do: if they talk informally, look at each other, and go to lunch together. (216)
- Another part of a connector’s role is to snip or weaken links that create tunnel vision or distorted and dangerous views of reality. (217)
- This challenge raises a third and final litmus test for leaders and powerful scaling teams: Have you done everything possible to make sure that the ties that bind you don’t also blind you? (218)
- BAD IS STRONGER THAN GOOD (219)
- Clearing the Way for Excellence (219)
- Destructive behaviors of just about every stripe—selfishness, nastiness, anxiety, laziness, dishonesty, for example—pack a bigger wallop than constructive behaviors. (220)
- to clear the way for spreading and sustaining something good, they’ve got to take out the bad and keep it out. (221)
- It’s Not My Problem (223)
- Several factors help explain why people who witness bad behavior in organizations and elsewhere don’t move to stop it—and shed light on how to encourage them to intervene. (224)
- Ambiguity is the first reason. (225)
- The lesson is, to stop destructive behavior in organizations, you’ve got to remove any doubt among witnesses that the words and deeds in question are, indeed, very bad. (225)
- The second factor is what Darley and Latané called “diffusion of responsibility”—even though bystanders may recognize a situation as bad, with so many others around, surely someone else will do the right thing (or has done so already). (225)
- The third factor is that, because no one else is helping, people may worry that other witnesses will disapprove if they jump in and do what they believe is right. (225)
- In short, three kinds of moves can reverse bystander inaction in organizations, and elsewhere. (226)
- First, make sure that each person feels personally obligated to reverse or repair problems, no matter what others around him or her do or don’t do. (226)
- Second, make sure that everyone knows and agrees on what bad behavior looks like. Err on the side of being explicit, loud, and repetitive. (226)
- Third, make sure that bad behavior doesn’t become “normalized,” collectively seen as a necessary evil, inevitable and unstoppable, expected and accepted, or even good naughty fun. (226)
- Good People, Perverse Incentives, and Bad Behavior (226)
- Destructive mindsets often emerge when organizations use incentives meant to fuel good behavior—but when the easiest way (and sometimes the only way) to get those goodies is to do something bad. After a while, bad behavior doesn’t seem so wrong because everyone around you does it, they seem to encourage (or demand) that you do it, and you press others to sin along with you. (226)
- This appalling story has two hallmarks of other cases where rewards and punishments produce bad behavior. (228)
- The first hallmark is that incentives are vivid enough and strong enough that, eventually, just about everyone’s behavior flips to the bad side. (228)
- The second hallmark is that misguided incentives encourage people to take the easy way out rather than to do the right thing—they fixate on the most efficient shenanigans for running the right numbers up (or down) and shun the hard work required to achieve true excellence. (229)
- Breaking Bad (230)
- The upshot of these cases and studies is that the outcome of spreading excellence depends on a process that enables people to prevent and eliminate destructive attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. We now turn to eight methods that leaders and scaling teams can use for “breaking bad.” (230)
- 1. Nip It in the Bud (230)
- The broken windows theory suggests that allowing even a little bit of bad to occur or persist is a mistake because it signals that no one is watching, no one cares, and no one will stop people from doing even worse things. (230)
- If you look the other way or decide that some small violation isn’t worth dealing with, things can quickly degenerate. (231)
- As research on preventing errors in workplaces from hospitals to manufacturing plants shows, when people live in fear of being humiliated, demoted, punished, or otherwise disgraced and shunned, they don’t admit mistakes and don’t help others avert problems. (232)
- 2. Get Rid of the Bad Apples (233)
- And one of the most reliable ways to eradicate a destructive mindset is to remove the bad apples. (233)
- employees who are bad apples in one setting are sometimes good apples in another. (236)
- 3. Plumbing Before Poetry (237)
- The broken windows theory has direct implications for James March’s distinction between leaders as “poets” and as “plumbers,” (237)
- The theory suggests that getting people to focus on the small, mundane, and sometimes gritty details of organizational life is an effective path for eliminating the negative. In March’s lingo, you’d better fix the plumbing before you start spouting out the poetry. (237)
- 4. Adequacy Before Excellence (239)
- CEB’s research shows that customer loyalty has more to do with how well companies keep their “basic, even plain vanilla promises” than with how well they dazzle customers. (240)
- 5. Use the Cool Kids (and Adults) to Define and Squelch Bad Behavior (241)
- Thus an effective way to eliminate the negative is to recruit the most admired and connected people in your organization, teach them what “bad” looks like, and encourage them to stop being perpetrators. (243)
- The executive didn’t have much luck changing the norm as the lone advocate. But once he recruited those two influential members—the local cool kids—to stop themselves and others from being bad, the team’s norms changed rapidly. (243)
- 6. Kill the Thrill (244)
- Indeed, a common and often vexing obstacle to spreading excellence is that being bad sometimes feels so good. (244)
- First, as many studies of theft demonstrate, what people steal and how much they steal is often driven by peer pressure, not by what management does. Stealing and other forms of bad behavior are often ways to garner prestige from colleagues. (246)
- Second, although financial incentives can cause—or stifle—bad behavior, they are often unnecessary. If you can identify other powerful incentives and disincentives (such as those annoyed spouses), you can sometimes stop bad behavior without spending a penny. (246)
- Third, in addition to pride and prestige, there are often intrinsic joys to engaging in bad behavior: for many employees, stealing was one of the most challenging parts of working at the sawmill. (246)
- 7. Time Shifting: From Current to Future Selves (247)
- You can sometimes break bad by getting people to think about the person they hope to be, not just the person they are now. (247)
- Leaders can sometimes help employees shift to their future selves by making ambitious goals more vivid and emotionally compelling. (248)
- Time shifting does not always require a big hairy goal, as management guru Jim Collins would put it, to convince people to eliminate the negative and accentuate the positive. Sometimes it just requires finding ways to make the impact of employees’ negative actions more vivid to them, so they will work harder to link short-term actions to long-term consequences. (248)
- 8. Focus on the Best Times, the Worst Times, and the End (249)
- Daniel Kahneman’s “peak-end rule”: no matter how good or bad an experience is, or how long it lasts, judgments about it are shaped disproportionally by the best and worst moments and if it ended well or badly. (249)
- This insight doesn’t just apply to customer experiences; it also applies, for example, to employees’ careers. The peak-end rule suggests that going out of your way to create better experiences is especially wise as an employee leaves an organization or team. (250)
- Warning Signs: Five Dangerous Feelings (251)
- We home in on five feelings that, when pervasive, signal that bad behavior already exists—or soon will. (251)
- The first dangerous feeling is fear of taking responsibility, especially the sense that it is safer to do nothing, or something bad, than the right thing. (251)
- Silence is one of the most reliable signs that people are afraid to take personal responsibility and that the learning and self-criticism that fuel excellence aren’t happening. (252)
- The second bad feeling is the fear of being ostracized, or socially excluded. (253)
- In general, embarrassment and exclusion are best applied in small doses and with proper precautions. (254)
- Embarrassment is most effective when it steers people toward a viable (and ethical) path to pride and inclusion. (254)
- The third dangerous feeling is anonymity. (254)
- There is another way that the feeling of anonymity can be dangerous: accountability is difficult to sustain when employees perceive the people they serve as nameless and faceless, as mere objects or numbers to be processed, rather than as living breathing human beings who deserve their full attention and talents. (255)
- The fourth warning sign is feelings of injustice. (256)
- The fundamental lesson from this research was summarized by Michael Dearing earlier in this chapter: “There is a difference between what you do and how you do it.” (256)
- Whether you are doing something bad like giving people pay cuts or demotions, or something good like giving them raises and promotions, employees will work harder, go out of their way to do extra work, stay later, and be more loyal to you if you take the time to explain why your actions were necessary, talk to them about how these changes will unfold, and treat them with dignity along the way. (257)
- The fifth dangerous feeling is helplessness. (257)
- The key to curing helplessness in both animals and humans is to convince them that, despite what happened in the past, there are steps they can take now to make things better. (257)
- When someone can find some way to direct a team’s or an organization’s attention toward the people affected by what it does (and away from members’ own needs and wants), they will take greater responsibility for doing the right thing. (258)
- DID THIS, NOT THAT (263)
- Imagine You’ve Already Succeeded (or Failed) (263)
- We also considered several overarching lessons under various guises, especially that the best leaders and teams treat scaling as a marathon rather than a sprint, are dedicated to gaining insights from every accomplishment and setback, and are driven by the nagging feeling that things are never quite good enough—by the “relentless restlessness” that Pixar’s Brad Bird pegged as a hallmark of organizations where, little by little, people keep getting better at what they do. (264)
- Look Back from the Future (264)
- A scaling premortem works something like this: when your team is on the verge of making and implementing a big decision, call a meeting and ask each member to imagine that it is, say, a year later. (264)
- Split them into two groups. Have one group imagine that the effort was an unmitigated disaster. Have the other pretend it was a roaring success. Ask each member to work independently and generate reasons, or better yet, write a story, about why the success or failure occurred. Instruct them to be as detailed as possible and, as Klein emphasizes, to identify causes that they wouldn’t usually mention “for fear of being impolitic.” (264)
- Finally, use the reasons from both groups to strengthen your scaling plan. (265)
- For starters, looking “back from the future” helps people overcome blind spots. (266)
- Weick argues that this shift is effective, in part, because it is far easier to imagine the detailed causes of a single outcome than to imagine multiple outcomes and try to explain why each may have occurred. (266)
- Beyond that, analyzing a single event as if it has already occurred rather than pretending it might occur makes it seem more concrete and likely to actually happen, which motivates people to devote more attention to explaining it. (266)
- Looking back from the future also dampens excessive optimism, especially if the imagined outcome is a failure, is mediocre, or falls just short of being as wonderful as expected. (266)
- Those Stanford leaders might also have asked another question: “If you were advising another university in the same situation as us, what would you suggest?” (267)
- Harvard’s Max Bazerman demonstrates that people are less prone to irrational optimism when they predict the fate of others’ projects or businesses rather than their own. (267)
- A premortem can also shatter illusions that everyone on a scaling team concurs with a decision that is about to be made or that everyone believes an effort is going well and will continue to do so. (268)
- The resulting corrosive conformity is evident when people don’t raise private doubts, known risks, and inconvenient facts. In contrast, as Klein explains, a premortem can create a competition where members feel accountable for raising obstacles that others haven’t: (268)
- Was Scaling a Good Idea? (268)
- The “imagine you have succeeded (or failed)” approach is especially useful for “go, no-go” decisions; for deciding if a scaling effort is worth launching at all, should be implemented as quickly or early as planned, or ought to continue. (268)
- Several kinds of premortem questions are instructive to mull over. Start with feasibility. Was it actually scalable? Were you able to spread a pocket of goodness in ways that maintained quality and were economically viable? (269)
- Feasibility questions also focus on if it was wise to scale as fast and as far as you did. (269)
- Other premortem questions ought to focus on the toll that scaling took on people’s lives. Even if you did ultimately succeed at spreading something wonderful far and wide, was it worth the cost? (269)
- Finally, we suggest asking questions about the destination you will have reached if your dreams do come true. Sometimes success isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. (270)
- Did This, Not That (272)
- In this spirit, we describe each lesson as if you already “did this, not that” rather than that “do this, not that.” (273)
- 1. We Started Where We Were, Not Where We Hoped to Arrive (273)
- 2. We Did Scaling, Not Just Swarming (274)
- As Park’s actions suggest, there are several intertwined ways that leaders can re-engage potential supporters. (192)
- First, remind them of the dormant connection. (192)
- Next, channel those feelings toward action; gently entice and prod people to rekindle old connections and create new ones, (192)
- Third, make it easy for “renewed recruits” to live the excellence you aim to spread, and in turn, to pass it along—to (193)
- Connect Everybody: Turn Work into a Game That People Like to Play (194)
- Reeves and other “gamification” advocates assert that workplaces would be more fun and effective if the principles for designing computer games were applied to designing organizations. (195)
- To kill them off, many firms use “murder boards,” committees that not only kill ideas but subject the people who propose them to withering criticism, even ridicule. Colleagues who witness such ugliness tend to keep their ideas to themselves lest they suffer the same fate. (196)
- This internal stock market has three categories: 1. “Savings Bonds,” ideas that could save the company money or increase efficiency 2. “Bow Jones,” ideas that use existing technology to create new products or services 3. “SPAZDAQ,” ideas about new technologies (196)
- After an employee submits a new idea, it is quickly and lightly screened by a senior engineer and listed in Mutual Fun. Every employee gets $10,000 of play opinion money to invest in their colleagues’ “idea stocks.” (197)
- The game also enables employees to discuss ideas and volunteer to work on them (on their own time). Stocks that attract more play money and volunteers move up in value; the firm invests “Adventure Capital” (real money) in the top fifteen stocks. (197)
- Stocks that don’t attract investors are delisted but often spark new proposals. (197)
- When an idea saves money or produces revenue, creators and implementers share the gains—with a greater percentage going to implementers. (197)
- Making Nets Work (198)
- Our first rule is Once is not enough because beliefs and behaviors do not spread like contagious diseases—one exposure is rarely enough to infect people. (198)
- Our second rule, One is not enough, follows from the first. Each tool isn’t right for every scaling challenge. Nor are all tools mutually exclusive. Using a blend of two or more is usually better than relying on just one. (199)
- Here is our menu of seven tools for getting nets to work. (199)
- 1. The Top-Down Approach (199)
- Hierarchies come in handy for creating a domino chain reaction that starts from the top and cascades down the pecking order. (199)
- But for more complex and controversial changes, command-and-demand often isn’t enough. (200)
- 2. Broadcast Your Message Out to One and All (200)
- Webinars, brochures, mailings, websites, and gatherings where senior executives make speeches to employees are part of many scaling efforts. (200)
- But such “air war” tactics alone are rarely enough to persuade people to join on and help expand a movement. (200)
- Creating those strong ties required ground war tactics: personal e-mails, phone calls, and especially face-to-face interaction. (201)
- 3. Surround Them: Have the Many Teach the Few (201)
- One of the most effective—if inefficient—ways to spread new behaviors and beliefs is to take one person, or a small team, and embed them among large numbers of people who already eat, live, and breathe the mindset that you want them to embrace. (201)
- 4. One on One: The Power of Pairs (202)
- This tool is core to most successful scaling efforts: nearly all depend at least partly on dyads where each “domino” topples the next. (202)
- Zynga, which makes “social” Web-based games such as FarmVille, has a policy that encourages managers to mentor direct reports: you can’t get a promotion to the next level unless you “grow your own replacement.” (202)
- Pairings are also critical for spreading change: not just for teaching new ideas and skills but also for persuading others to support and smooth implementation. (202)
- When it comes to one-on-one influence, focus on supporters and fence-sitters. Try to pair the “persuaders” on your scaling team with powerful people who already trust and admire them. Beware of pairing up with resisters. (204)
- 5. From the Few to the Many (204)
- She called this the “Trojan Horse effect” because, once they got a “seat at the table” and worked with a business’s leadership team, these experienced innovators did what came naturally to them—using design thinking to solve problems. The connect-and-cascade process kicked in: as they helped colleagues in other disciplines solve problems, not only did these colleagues come to value the innovators’ knowledge and skills, but many learned and began applying the methods themselves. (205)
- Kotchka discovered a related lesson about implanting “Trojan Horses”: putting just one designer in a business didn’t work. They felt lonely and didn’t have like-minded coworkers to bounce ideas off and serve as allies. (205)
- The few must use their grit and skill to teach and convert others, who, in turn, start the domino chain of goodness in motion. (205)
- 6. Brokers: Bridging Disconnected Islands (206)
- When a pocket of people have got something good, but no path connects them and their knowledge to others who need it, excellence can’t spread. (206)
- Brokers “fill” these holes and transfer information, expertise, ideas, and influence between those who have it and those who need it. (206)
- Kelley’s masterful brokering. We’ve boiled down his efforts to five key elements: (208)
- 1. He is curious about strangers and their ideas (208)
- 2. He lives and breathes the mindset but isn’t obnoxious about it. (209)
- 3. He has strong opinions, weakly held. (209)
- 4. He listens and learns. (209)
- 5. He convenes, introduces, and connects. (209)
- David Kelley is skilled and relentless in his efforts to link people, teams, and organizations that need each other—but hadn’t known that before. (210)
- 7. Create Crossroads Where People Connect (210)
- When it comes to scaling excellence in and across organizations, bazaarlike settings enable people to build new connections and strengthen old ones—largely through one-on-one interactions. (210)
- Create a Common Heartbeat (212)
- Recent studies show that when people share rhythms with others they develop stronger emotional bonds and are more likely to pitch in for the common good. (212)
- When people share the same daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal rhythms, connections among them form faster and stay stronger. The people trust each other more deeply, and coordination becomes easier because they see and experience the world in the same way. (213)
- Not only do these daily meetings strengthen connections in the team, they also mean that members have a constant supply of fresh information about the challenges that Reily faces and solutions that are and are not working. (213)
- Although creating enthusiasm and spreading awareness about new beliefs, behaviors, and initiatives are useful first steps for mobilizing a mindset, they aren’t enough. People have to live it or it won’t stick. (274)
- Training was central to many of the scaling efforts that we’ve highlighted, (275)
- Unfortunately, training sometimes creates little more than a brief swarm of activity. Much like corporate kick-offs where follow-up is lame or nonexistent, training has little effect when new behaviors and beliefs are taught but no steps are taken to enable people and teams to live those lessons. (275)
- 3. We Used Our Mindset as a Guide, Not as the Answer to Every Question and Problem (277)
- Yet, like all deep rooted human beliefs, mindsets are double-edged swords. You need them, but you should never stop asking whether the time is ripe to cast them aside. (277)
- 4. We Used Constraints That Channeled, Rather Than Derailed, Ingenuity and Effort (278)
- A key lesson about this spectrum warrants further emphasis and explanation: scaling flows more quickly and easily when people operate under a small number of ironclad constraints that they can rarely, if ever, crash through. (278)
- Research on creativity and innovation provides an enlightening perspective on constraints. (278)
- Research on creativity and constraint demonstrates that, when options are limited, people generate more, rather than less, varied solutions—apparently because their attention is less scattered. (279)
- Even when careful repetition and replication are required, smart scaling teams keep the list of constraints short to ease cognitive load and direct attention to the most pressing challenges. (279)
- When a partner lands a potential piece of work, it is reviewed by one or two other partners who won’t be involved in the project. The firm will not commit to the project unless both (or all three) partners support a “go decision.” (281)
- Wyatt added something that dovetails with Daniel Kahneman’s warnings about human overconfidence: this practice is necessary because “architects are so naturally confident that they believe they can do anything.” (281)
- 5. Our Hierarchy Squelched Unnecessary Friction, Rather Than Creating and Spreading It (282)
- Fry and fellow executive Steve Greene don’t believe that the hierarchy should be used to unleash anarchy. They mean it should be used, in Greene’s words, to “build a better organizational operating system”—a (282)
- Fry and Greene emphasize that, although more roles and processes are needed as organizations and projects expand, skilled leaders wield their power to eliminate needless friction and complexity—not burden employees with “rules, tools, and fools” that make it tougher to do their jobs and waste money and talent. (282)
- the best organizations perform constant subtraction, not just addition and multiplication. (283)
- As more people come aboard, members do (and should) devote more time and effort to communication, coordination, and the maintenance of warm and trusting bonds. (283)
- A useful corollary is: if a team has leadership and performance problems, don’t start by blaming the leader or hunting for bad apples to reform or remove. Consider its size first. (283)
- if a team has more than six or seven members, break it into two or three subgroups. (283)
- 6. We Worked with People We Respected, Not Necessarily Our Friends (284)
- When a scaling effort is launched by a broad group that is representative of an organization’s people and positions (rather than a narrow subset), members will have professional, social, and emotional ties to colleagues throughout the organization. (284)
- Abraham’s advice is bolstered by research that shows teams are more adept at problem solving and creativity when members argue in an atmosphere of mutual respect—when each member feels compelled to “fight as if you are right, and listen as if you are wrong.” (285)
- 7. Accountability Prevailed, Free Riding and Other Bad Behaviors Failed (286)
- Lack of ownership and weak pressures to do the right thing aren’t evident just when employees shirk from providing adequate customer service (or elect not to do so because doing nothing is safer than trying to do the right thing). It also happens when the game of work encourages every employee to look out for him- or herself and no one else; when pay and promotion are linked to selfish acts such as ignoring or even undermining colleagues, people learn that their success and security hinges on thinking first, last, and always of “me” rather than “we or us.” When that happens, ownership and feelings of mutual obligation evaporate, and unfortunate assumptions frame and fuel nearly everything that people do. (287)
- In contrast, excellence spreads and persists when accountability pressures permeate a workplace—when that feeling of ownership for problems and solutions pervades each handoff, each meeting, and each interaction with the people whom an organization serves. (288)
- When everyone feels obligated to do the right thing, each person feels compelled to be both a teacher and a student—to share everything he or she knows with colleagues and to learn as much as possible from others as well. (288)
- The Satisfactions of Scaling (289)
- These are the kinds of satisfactions that propel effective scaling efforts day after day, that scaling veterans remember with well-deserved pride, and that entice them to join the next effort, even though the last one was so much darn work. (290)
- Fry concluded that, “It is not the meetings that matter; it is the rhythm that matters.” (215)
- Leaders as Connectors: Three Litmus Tests (215)
- some of the most savvy connectors are skilled at asking and acting on questions that uncover weak or missing links—but wield little formal authority and don’t have powerful carrots and sticks at their disposal. (216)
- You ask diverse members of the team, department, or organization about key aspects of their strategy, operations, policies, philosophy, and pressing problems they face. If they give you inconsistent and clashing answers to your queries, it is a sign of trouble—especially if they seem to have no knowledge or interest in the other answers that their colleagues give you. (216)
- The CFOs suggested a second litmus test, a diagnostic question: Is there more direct evidence that people are having a lot of one-on-one interactions, or conversely, that there is little if any interaction? The CFOs suggested watching what people do: if they talk informally, look at each other, and go to lunch together. (216)
- Another part of a connector’s role is to snip or weaken links that create tunnel vision or distorted and dangerous views of reality. (217)
- This challenge raises a third and final litmus test for leaders and powerful scaling teams: Have you done everything possible to make sure that the ties that bind you don’t also blind you? (218)
- BAD IS STRONGER THAN GOOD (219)
- Clearing the Way for Excellence (219)
- Destructive behaviors of just about every stripe—selfishness, nastiness, anxiety, laziness, dishonesty, for example—pack a bigger wallop than constructive behaviors. (220)
- to clear the way for spreading and sustaining something good, they’ve got to take out the bad and keep it out. (221)
- It’s Not My Problem (223)
- Several factors help explain why people who witness bad behavior in organizations and elsewhere don’t move to stop it—and shed light on how to encourage them to intervene. (224)
- Ambiguity is the first reason. (225)
- The lesson is, to stop destructive behavior in organizations, you’ve got to remove any doubt among witnesses that the words and deeds in question are, indeed, very bad. (225)
- The second factor is what Darley and Latané called “diffusion of responsibility”—even though bystanders may recognize a situation as bad, with so many others around, surely someone else will do the right thing (or has done so already). (225)
- The third factor is that, because no one else is helping, people may worry that other witnesses will disapprove if they jump in and do what they believe is right. (225)
- In short, three kinds of moves can reverse bystander inaction in organizations, and elsewhere. (226)
- First, make sure that each person feels personally obligated to reverse or repair problems, no matter what others around him or her do or don’t do. (226)
- Second, make sure that everyone knows and agrees on what bad behavior looks like. Err on the side of being explicit, loud, and repetitive. (226)
- Third, make sure that bad behavior doesn’t become “normalized,” collectively seen as a necessary evil, inevitable and unstoppable, expected and accepted, or even good naughty fun. (226)
- Good People, Perverse Incentives, and Bad Behavior (226)
- Destructive mindsets often emerge when organizations use incentives meant to fuel good behavior—but when the easiest way (and sometimes the only way) to get those goodies is to do something bad. After a while, bad behavior doesn’t seem so wrong because everyone around you does it, they seem to encourage (or demand) that you do it, and you press others to sin along with you. (226)
- This appalling story has two hallmarks of other cases where rewards and punishments produce bad behavior. (228)
- The first hallmark is that incentives are vivid enough and strong enough that, eventually, just about everyone’s behavior flips to the bad side. (228)
- The second hallmark is that misguided incentives encourage people to take the easy way out rather than to do the right thing—they fixate on the most efficient shenanigans for running the right numbers up (or down) and shun the hard work required to achieve true excellence. (229)
- Breaking Bad (230)
- The upshot of these cases and studies is that the outcome of spreading excellence depends on a process that enables people to prevent and eliminate destructive attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. We now turn to eight methods that leaders and scaling teams can use for “breaking bad.” (230)
- 1. Nip It in the Bud (230)
- The broken windows theory suggests that allowing even a little bit of bad to occur or persist is a mistake because it signals that no one is watching, no one cares, and no one will stop people from doing even worse things. (230)
- If you look the other way or decide that some small violation isn’t worth dealing with, things can quickly degenerate. (231)
- As research on preventing errors in workplaces from hospitals to manufacturing plants shows, when people live in fear of being humiliated, demoted, punished, or otherwise disgraced and shunned, they don’t admit mistakes and don’t help others avert problems. (232)
- 2. Get Rid of the Bad Apples (233)
- And one of the most reliable ways to eradicate a destructive mindset is to remove the bad apples. (233)
- employees who are bad apples in one setting are sometimes good apples in another. (236)
- 3. Plumbing Before Poetry (237)
- The broken windows theory has direct implications for James March’s distinction between leaders as “poets” and as “plumbers,” (237)
- The theory suggests that getting people to focus on the small, mundane, and sometimes gritty details of organizational life is an effective path for eliminating the negative. In March’s lingo, you’d better fix the plumbing before you start spouting out the poetry. (237)
- 4. Adequacy Before Excellence (239)
- CEB’s research shows that customer loyalty has more to do with how well companies keep their “basic, even plain vanilla promises” than with how well they dazzle customers. (240)
- 5. Use the Cool Kids (and Adults) to Define and Squelch Bad Behavior (241)
- Thus an effective way to eliminate the negative is to recruit the most admired and connected people in your organization, teach them what “bad” looks like, and encourage them to stop being perpetrators. (243)
- The executive didn’t have much luck changing the norm as the lone advocate. But once he recruited those two influential members—the local cool kids—to stop themselves and others from being bad, the team’s norms changed rapidly. (243)
- 6. Kill the Thrill (244)
- Indeed, a common and often vexing obstacle to spreading excellence is that being bad sometimes feels so good. (244)
- First, as many studies of theft demonstrate, what people steal and how much they steal is often driven by peer pressure, not by what management does. Stealing and other forms of bad behavior are often ways to garner prestige from colleagues. (246)
- Second, although financial incentives can cause—or stifle—bad behavior, they are often unnecessary. If you can identify other powerful incentives and disincentives (such as those annoyed spouses), you can sometimes stop bad behavior without spending a penny. (246)
- Third, in addition to pride and prestige, there are often intrinsic joys to engaging in bad behavior: for many employees, stealing was one of the most challenging parts of working at the sawmill. (246)
- 7. Time Shifting: From Current to Future Selves (247)
- You can sometimes break bad by getting people to think about the person they hope to be, not just the person they are now. (247)
- Leaders can sometimes help employees shift to their future selves by making ambitious goals more vivid and emotionally compelling. (248)
- Time shifting does not always require a big hairy goal, as management guru Jim Collins would put it, to convince people to eliminate the negative and accentuate the positive. Sometimes it just requires finding ways to make the impact of employees’ negative actions more vivid to them, so they will work harder to link short-term actions to long-term consequences. (248)
- 8. Focus on the Best Times, the Worst Times, and the End (249)
- Daniel Kahneman’s “peak-end rule”: no matter how good or bad an experience is, or how long it lasts, judgments about it are shaped disproportionally by the best and worst moments and if it ended well or badly. (249)
- This insight doesn’t just apply to customer experiences; it also applies, for example, to employees’ careers. The peak-end rule suggests that going out of your way to create better experiences is especially wise as an employee leaves an organization or team. (250)
- Warning Signs: Five Dangerous Feelings (251)
- We home in on five feelings that, when pervasive, signal that bad behavior already exists—or soon will. (251)
- The first dangerous feeling is fear of taking responsibility, especially the sense that it is safer to do nothing, or something bad, than the right thing. (251)
- Silence is one of the most reliable signs that people are afraid to take personal responsibility and that the learning and self-criticism that fuel excellence aren’t happening. (252)
- The second bad feeling is the fear of being ostracized, or socially excluded. (253)
- In general, embarrassment and exclusion are best applied in small doses and with proper precautions. (254)
- Embarrassment is most effective when it steers people toward a viable (and ethical) path to pride and inclusion. (254)
- The third dangerous feeling is anonymity. (254)
- There is another way that the feeling of anonymity can be dangerous: accountability is difficult to sustain when employees perceive the people they serve as nameless and faceless, as mere objects or numbers to be processed, rather than as living breathing human beings who deserve their full attention and talents. (255)
- The fourth warning sign is feelings of injustice. (256)
- The fundamental lesson from this research was summarized by Michael Dearing earlier in this chapter: “There is a difference between what you do and how you do it.” (256)
- Whether you are doing something bad like giving people pay cuts or demotions, or something good like giving them raises and promotions, employees will work harder, go out of their way to do extra work, stay later, and be more loyal to you if you take the time to explain why your actions were necessary, talk to them about how these changes will unfold, and treat them with dignity along the way. (257)
- The fifth dangerous feeling is helplessness. (257)
- The key to curing helplessness in both animals and humans is to convince them that, despite what happened in the past, there are steps they can take now to make things better. (257)
- When someone can find some way to direct a team’s or an organization’s attention toward the people affected by what it does (and away from members’ own needs and wants), they will take greater responsibility for doing the right thing. (258)
- DID THIS, NOT THAT (263)
- Imagine You’ve Already Succeeded (or Failed) (263)
- We also considered several overarching lessons under various guises, especially that the best leaders and teams treat scaling as a marathon rather than a sprint, are dedicated to gaining insights from every accomplishment and setback, and are driven by the nagging feeling that things are never quite good enough—by the “relentless restlessness” that Pixar’s Brad Bird pegged as a hallmark of organizations where, little by little, people keep getting better at what they do. (264)
- Look Back from the Future (264)
- A scaling premortem works something like this: when your team is on the verge of making and implementing a big decision, call a meeting and ask each member to imagine that it is, say, a year later. (264)
- Split them into two groups. Have one group imagine that the effort was an unmitigated disaster. Have the other pretend it was a roaring success. Ask each member to work independently and generate reasons, or better yet, write a story, about why the success or failure occurred. Instruct them to be as detailed as possible and, as Klein emphasizes, to identify causes that they wouldn’t usually mention “for fear of being impolitic.” (264)
- Finally, use the reasons from both groups to strengthen your scaling plan. (265)
- For starters, looking “back from the future” helps people overcome blind spots. (266)
- Weick argues that this shift is effective, in part, because it is far easier to imagine the detailed causes of a single outcome than to imagine multiple outcomes and try to explain why each may have occurred. (266)
- Beyond that, analyzing a single event as if it has already occurred rather than pretending it might occur makes it seem more concrete and likely to actually happen, which motivates people to devote more attention to explaining it. (266)
- Looking back from the future also dampens excessive optimism, especially if the imagined outcome is a failure, is mediocre, or falls just short of being as wonderful as expected. (266)
- Those Stanford leaders might also have asked another question: “If you were advising another university in the same situation as us, what would you suggest?” (267)
- Harvard’s Max Bazerman demonstrates that people are less prone to irrational optimism when they predict the fate of others’ projects or businesses rather than their own. (267)
- A premortem can also shatter illusions that everyone on a scaling team concurs with a decision that is about to be made or that everyone believes an effort is going well and will continue to do so. (268)
- The resulting corrosive conformity is evident when people don’t raise private doubts, known risks, and inconvenient facts. In contrast, as Klein explains, a premortem can create a competition where members feel accountable for raising obstacles that others haven’t: (268)
- Was Scaling a Good Idea? (268)
- The “imagine you have succeeded (or failed)” approach is especially useful for “go, no-go” decisions; for deciding if a scaling effort is worth launching at all, should be implemented as quickly or early as planned, or ought to continue. (268)
- Several kinds of premortem questions are instructive to mull over. Start with feasibility. Was it actually scalable? Were you able to spread a pocket of goodness in ways that maintained quality and were economically viable? (269)
- Feasibility questions also focus on if it was wise to scale as fast and as far as you did. (269)
- Other premortem questions ought to focus on the toll that scaling took on people’s lives. Even if you did ultimately succeed at spreading something wonderful far and wide, was it worth the cost? (269)
- Finally, we suggest asking questions about the destination you will have reached if your dreams do come true. Sometimes success isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. (270)
- Did This, Not That (272)
- In this spirit, we describe each lesson as if you already “did this, not that” rather than that “do this, not that.” (273)

- 2. We Did Scaling, Not Just Swarming (274)
