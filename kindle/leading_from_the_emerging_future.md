# Leading from the Emerging Future: From Ego-System to Eco-System Economies

* Ego-system awareness cares about the well-being of oneself, eco-system awareness cares about the well being of all, including oneself.
* Iceberg model - beneath visible events and crises, are the underlying structures, mental models, and sources that are responsible for creating them. If ignored, we are doomed to repeat these patterns.
* Dealing with symptoms one cluster at a time (siloed) isn't working. On the contrary, it seems to be part of the problem.
* 3 Key Questions
  * In the face of disruption, how do we lead from the emerging future?
    * Two fundamentally different modes of learning: from the past and from the emerging future.
  * What evolutionary economic framework can guide our journey forward?
    * economic framework follows evolution of homan conciousness (they are highly interdependent)
  * What strategies can help us to function as vehicles for shifting the whole?
    * focusing on all 8 acupuncture points
* The source is, from a systems view, where the feedback loop between mind and matters closes in the now, both individually and collectively. We call these "closing-in" points or accupunture points.
* Strategies to help us function as vehicles for the future that wants to emerge:
  * as individuals, groups and organizations, bend attention back to its source to cultivate generative relationships and advance institutional inversion
  * focus on all eight accupuncture points to update economic and societal logic
  * shift global field of entrepreneurship by creating multiregional network of hubs to support building intentional eco-system economies on a scale that meets the challenges of our time
* Journey from Ego-System to Eco-System Awareness
  * Better relating to others.
  * Better relating to the whole system.
  * Better relating to oneself.
* 3 streams/movements beginning to come together now:
  * global civil society, in the tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King
  * action science, as represented by Kurt Lewin and Ed Schein
  * mindfulness and awareness, inherent in all wisdom traditions

## 8 Disconnects

* Disconnects represent decoupling of the structure of societal reality from the structure of economic thought, or decoupling structures of eco-system reality from structures of ego-system awareness.
* Structural disconnects produce systems with delays and broken feedback loops that prevent learning by not allowing decision-makers to experience and personally feel the impact of their decisions. This results in institutions which change too little and too late.
* Shared characteristics of the disconnects:
  * embody structures that are designed not to learn
  * unaware of externalities
  * facilitate money flowing the wrong way (positive externalities up, negative externalities down)
  * allow special-interest groups to rig the system to the disadvantage of the whole
* Unlike increasing GDP, reducing inequality improves welfare of citizens

### Disconnect: Nature

* Connect production, consumption, reuse, and recycling through "earth-to-earth" design.
* Evolution: Mother Nature, Resource, Commodity (land, raw materials), Regulated Commodity, Eco-System and Commons
* Propositions:
  * All economic activity arises from and returns to nature.
  * Commodity fiction - where nature is thought of as a commodity.
  * Biomimicry - Zero Waste, Solar Energy, Diversity and Symbiosis.
  * Closed-Loop Designs
* Solutions: Slow Food, community-supported agriculture (CSA), local food, local living economies, sustainable sourcing, etc.

### Disconnect: Labor

* Connect work (jobs) to Work (passion) through new entrepreneurship infrastructures connecting self and Self.
* Evolution: Self-Sufficiency, Serfdom/Slavery, Labor (commodity), Labor (regulated commodity), Social and Business Entrepreneurship
* Propositions:
  * Discourse of Denial - suggest we are in a cyclical downturn that will be solved as soon as the recession ends, bringing future growth and returning lost industrial jobs
  * Growth Myth - suggest we will solve economic woes through accelerated growth. Disregards: Ecological Limits, Social Limits, and Jobless Growth.
  * Money Myth - suggests that we should work for money, rather than intrinsic rewards.
  * Relinking Work and Entrepreneurship - relink work (jobs) with Work (purpose).
* Solutions: enabling spaces for innovation, key challenges, sensing, capacity-building mechanisms, capital, technology, and community (mentors, partners, and entrepreneurs)

### Disconnect: Capital

* Connect capital with value creation by redirecting speculation into ecological, social, and cultural-creative renewal through gifts and intentional capital.
* Evolution: Natural Capital, Human Capital, Industrial Capital, Financial Capital (externality-blind), Cultural Creative Capital (externality-aware)
* Myths:
  * Financial System is Efficient - focuses too narrowly on short-term profitability, lacks awareness of negative side effects on people and the planet.
  * Money is Capital - individual and collective creativity are the ultimate source of all capital and value creation.
  * Money is a Commodity - seek to relink creation of money with entrepreneurial intention in communities. Redirect profit-seeking speculation to regenerative side of economy: innovation, education, health, sustainability, and the environmental, social, and cultural commons.
  * Money Equals Money - Transfers of money are not just a technical act, they are mirrored as one of: Speculation, Purchase, Loan, or Gift.
    * Gifts may generates highest productivity by empowering the recipient to sense and actualize their emerging future, rather than satisfying funder/stakeholder expectations which tend to be rooted in the past.
* Solutions:
  * New tools to monitor economic/social impact across all four uses of money to increase transparency and awareness.
  * Concept of captial relinking to its source: the collective creativity of all actors in an economic community.
  * Concept of money which makes it's creation transparent and aligned with entrepreneurial intention in a community.
  * Healthier balance among four roles of money through eliminating speculation and strengthening gifts to allow more people to realize their full entrepreneurial potential.

### Disconnect: Technology

* Connect tech creation to societal needs, particularly in underserved markets, through needs assessment and participatory planning.
* Evolution: Indigenous Wisdom, Tools (agricultural revolution), Machines (industrial revolution, coal/steam/railway), System-Centric Automation (2nd industrial revolution, oil/combustion-engine/chemicals), Human-Centric (3rd Industrial revolution, renewables/information-technology)
* Propositions:
  * Liberation Myth - whether technology provides liberation or dependency depends on the quality of awareness we bring.
  * Technology-Fix Myth - despite many failures, a belief that it can magically solve global and local crises maintains.
  * Relink R&D Investment with Pressing Societal Needs
  * Lead the Third Industrial Revolution - we should focus future policy and public investment in whether technology improves or stifles our creativity.
* Solutions:
  * Move from system-centric technologies to human and/or life-centric technologies that we can shape and give meaning to.
  * Create intentional communities of creation (alla Torvald and linux).

### Disconnect: Leadership

* Absence of leadership leads to collectively creating results that nobody wants.
* Connect leadership to the emerging future of the whole through co-sensing, co-inspiring, and co-creating.
* Evolution: Community, Authoritarian (sticks), Incentives (carrots), Participative (norms), Co-creative (collective presence)
* Myths:
  * The Leader is the Person at the Top - to face todays challenges, many, many people in the organization (sometimes everyone) need to be involved.
  * Leadership is About Individuals - leadership is actually a distributed/collective capacity in a system.
  * Leadership is About Creating and Communicating a Vision - focuses too much on broadcasting and not enough on listening.
* Solution: Collective Sensing and Prototyping:
  * Co-initiating - help stakeholders in fragmented systems connect and discover common ground.
  * Co-sensing - help people walk in each other's shoes, see the system from the edges, and develop collective sensing capacity.
  * Co-inspiring - find deeper sources of knowing through deep reflection and intentional moments of stillness
  * Co-creating - exploring the future through hands-on prototyping
  * Co-evolving - scaling and sustaining the new

### Disconnect: Consumption

* Connect economic output to well-being of all through concious/collaborative consuming, and new success indicators like gross national happiness (GNH).
* Evolution: Survival, Traditional (needs-driven), Consumerism (mass consumption), Selectively Concious Consumption, Collaborative Concious Consumption (CCC)
* Myths:
  * Production and Consumption Are Seperate - customer needs don't mark the start of production. Consumers are a target of economic activity, rather than a partner.
  * Consumers Are Seperate From One Another - customers are starting to co-create the economy in a more concious, collection, and intentional way.
  * Material Consumption Creatse Well-Being
* Solutions:
  * Technology - easy access to information levels the playing field.
  * Awareness - more and more consumers desire lifestyles that are healthy, mindful, and sustainable.
  * Disruption - the intensity and frequency of disruption and breakdown are growing.
  * Economic Human Rights - more and more people find it unacceptable to see rich nations failing to reduce the number of people who live in poverty.

### Disconnect: Coordination

* Connect economic parts to the whole through awareness-based collective action (ABC).
* Both the visible hand of central planning and invisible hand of decentralized markets do not require individual decision-makers to consider the well-being of the whole.
* Evolution: Community, Heirarchy/Control, Markets/Competition, Networks/Negotiation, Awareness Based Collective Action (ABC)
* Evolution:
  * Centrally Controlled Economy - (sticks) exterior mechanisms such as targets and plans.
  * Market Economy - (carrots) exterior mechanisms such as price and competition.
  * Social-Market Economy - (norms) exterior/interior mechanisms of negotiation, networks, and dialogue.
  * Co-Creative Eco-System Economy - (ABC) interior mechanisms of common awareness.
* Propositions:
  * Market vs Heirarchies Myth - false dichotomy.
  * Both-And, Not Either-Or - we need both markets and governments.
  * An Economy is Not a Business - economies can not walk away form citizens and it must internalize it's externalities
  * ABC Closes Feedback Loop Between Parts and Whole - build on (heirarchy, markets, negotiation) with capacity of the system to see, sense, and regenerate itself (ABC)

### Disconnect: Ownership

* Connect ownership rights to best use of assets through shared ownership and commons-based property right that safeguard the interests of future generations.
* Property rights are a bundle of legally enforceable rights and responsibilities including: access, use, management, exclusion, and alienation (right to sell).
* Evolution: Communal, State, Private, Mixed (public/private), Commons-Based
* Myths:
  * Only Private Rights Are Efficient - there are counter examples, and private rights have not addressed common resources.
  * Rights Must Be Either Public or Private - false dichotomy, many variations and commons-based options.
* Solution: Commons-Based Property Rights - trusts and trustees accountable to all stakeholders (including future generations).

## Presencing

* What is missing is taking a moment to reflect on what we are doing to ourselves.
* Gist of framework: The quality of results produced by any system depends on the quality of awareness from which people in the system operate.
* Presencing blends sensing (feeling the future possibility) and presence (state of being in the present moment). It means sensing and actualizing one's highest future possibility--acting from the presence of what is wanting to emerge.

1. Energy follows attention.
2. Follow the three movements of the U.
  a. Down the U: Observe, observe, observe. Stop downloading, immerse yourself in the places of most potential that matter most to your situation.
  b. At the Bottom: Retreat, and reflect. Allow inner knowing to emerge.
  c. Up the U: Act in an instant. Explore the future by doing. Develop a prototype.
3. Go to the edges of the self. With an open mind, we can suspend old habits of thought. With an open heart, we can empathize. With an open will, we can let go and let the new come.
4. Pass through the eye of the needle. Identify Self as your highest future possibilty, and Work as your sense of purpose or calling.
5. Transform the three enemies.
  a. Voice of doubt and judgement (VoJ), shutting down the open mind.
  b. Voice of cynicism (VoC), shutting down the open heart.
  c. Voice of fear (VoF), shutting down the open will.
6. Always start by "attending to the crack." Identify the openings, challenges, and disruptions where we feel the past ending and the future wanting to begin.
7. Hold space for transforming conversation from debate to dialoge and collective creativity.
8. Avoid the destructive dynamics of absencing.
  a. Denial: not seeing what is going on.
  b. De-sensing: lacking empathy for others.
  c. Absencing: losing connenction to ones' Self.
  d. Delusion: being guided by illusions.
  e. Destruction: destroying others and ourselves.

* Absencing means getting caught in one or more tyrannies (the triple tyranny is referred to as fundamentalism):
  * One Truth (idealism)
  * One "Us" Versus "Them" (collectivism)
  * One Will (fanaticism)

## Evolution of Economic Operating System

* Early economic concepts saw economy as firmly integrated into societal whole, whereas modern economics conceive of economy as an autonomous subsystem.
* Economic monotheism puts primacy in the invisible hand of the market as the one coordination mechanism over all economic activity.
* How is power transmitted in society?
  * Primitive - power is transmitted through violence
  * Developed - power is transmitted through money
  * Advanced - power is transmitted through cultural capital (such as belief systems)
* Economies/Societies transition through exterior challenge (push) and development of conciousness (pull).

* 1.0 - Heirarchy
  * Ideology - state-centric - Strong central actor that holds decision making power of the whole.
  * Pros: Stability
  * Cons: Inhibits individual initiative and freedom.
* 2.0 - Market Competition
  * Ideology - market-centric - State-based legal/military coercive power and/or market-based remunerative power.
  * Pros: Growth
  * Cons: negative externalities such as unbounded commodification and unintended side effects (child labor, human trafficking, environmental destruction, increasing inequality).
* 3.0 - Interest Groups
  * Ideology: communication/discourse-centric - Integrates markets and government.
  * Pros: Addresses Negative Externalities
  * Cons: Disadvantages groups that are too large to easily organize (ie consumers, taxpayers, citizens) or those who do not yet have a voice (future generations)
* 4.0 - Emerging Whole

## Source: Connecting to Intention and Awareness

* 3 Thresholds of Becoming Aware:
  * Suspension - stopping/suspending old habits of judgement and thought.
  * Redirection - listening to views and experiences of others and begin to see reality from a multiplicity of views.
  * Letting Go - connect with who we really are and what we are here for.
* Targets: Individuals Attending, Groups Conversing, Institutions Organizing, and Global Systems Coordinating
* Evolution:
  * Downloading: listener hears ideas, but only to reconfirm what they already know.
  * Factual Listening: listener lets the data talk to them (like a good scientist).
  * Empathic Listening: listener sees reality from the perspective of the other and sense the other person's circumstances.
  * Generative Listening: listener forms a space of deep attention, allowing the emerging future posibility to manifest (like a good coach).
* Solution: Individuals must pay attention to attention (self-awareness), teams must convers about conversation (dialogue), enterprises must organize organizing (networks of networks: eco-systems), and ecosystems must coordinate coordinating (systems of awareness based collective action (ABC)).

# Leading the Personal Inversion: From Me to We

* Evolution of Listening: Habitual, Factual, Empathic, Generative
* Conditions:
  * Bending the Beam of Observation - beam first radiates to the outside world (level 2), then bends back onto the self (level 3), then finds sources of self, becoming present (level 4)
  * A Holding Space for Embracing the Shadow - creating a social holding space through true listening from the heart.
  * Going to the Edge of Letting Go - the willingness to go to the edge of the abyss, to let go, to lean into the unknown, and to take the leap.
* 12 Principles:
  * Practice, Don't Preach
  * Observe, Observe, Observe - become a blackbelt observer and listener.
  * Connect to Your Intention as an Instrument - link work with Work, job with Job, self with Self.
  * When the Crack Opens Up, Stay With It, Connect and Act from the Now - observation and intention connect horizontally and vertically with higher levels of presence and readiness, but you still must act when opportunities arise.
  * Follow Your Heart, Do What You Love, Love What You Do - make sure at least some of your portfolio are things you love doing.
  * Always Be in Dialogue with the Universe - the larger context that surrounds us provides useful feedback. We need to learn to listen and identify the elements of feedback that are helpful to evolve our idea.
  * Create a Holding Space of Deep Listening that Supports Your Journey - seek Self, your capacity to access your highest future possibility. Two of the most effective mechanisms for access are cultivation practices and deep-listening circle work.
  * Iterate, Iterate, Iterate - practice and adapt to what you see emerging.
  * Notice the Crack to the Filed of the Future - attending to openings requires exploring the edges of the system and the self. At the edges, when we are lucky, we can sinse a field of future possibility that is wanting to emerge.
  * Use Different Language with Different Stakeholders - focus on the issues that matter to the audience. Broaden and deepen the definition of the problem to get all relevant parties commited to participation.
  * If You Want to Change Others, Be Open to Changing Yourself First - if you need to change a system without heirarchy, your main leverage is the quality of your relationship with other stakeholders. That is what you must build and strengthen.
  * Never Give Up. Never Give Up. You Are Not Alone - innovation and renewal take enormous amounts of perseverance. Important ideas may take many years of failed effort, and/or practice, before producing something concrete.

# Leading the Relational Inversion: From Ego to Eco

* Instead of just seeing others, we need to learn to see ourselves through the eyes of others and of the whole.
* Habitual Reactions Which Prevent Consequences of Actions from Sinking In: denial, cynicism, and depression.
* Evolution:
  * Unilateral, One-Way Downloading, Manipulation - intent to manipulate, rather than serve the well-being of the other side.
  * Bilateral, Two-Way Discussions, Exchange of Viewpoints - intent to provide/receive information, includes response/feedback mechanism.
  * Multilateral Stakeholder Dialogue, Seeing Oneself Through Eyes of Another - characterized by reflection, learning, and dialogue.
  * Co-creative Eco-system Innovation, Blurring Boundary of Ego and Eco - conversation helping diverse groups to co-sense and co-create the future by transforming awareness from ego to eco.
* Solution: Leverage Points:
  * Get rid of toxic level 1 communication (bribery, soft money, commercials, propaganda and manipulation).
  * Develop new spheres of level 4 co-creative stakeholder relationships, where partners in eco-system can come together to co-sense, prototype, and co-create the future of their eco-system.
* Principle: Energy Follows Attention - focusing only on focusing problems or closing gaps limits creativity.
* We can redraw the boundaries of competition and cooperation by introducing arenas of premarket cooperation among all sectors.
* Five Key Innovation Infrasctructures:
  * Co-Initiating - Successful multistakeholder projects require unconditional commitment from local leaders who are credible in their own communities. The core group that co-initiates the project must reflect the diversity of the overall eco-system.
  * Co-Sensing - To change our mindset we need to explore the edges of the system, seeing other perspectives, particularly from marginalize members. Shadowing practices and stakeholder interviews can help here. This is an area where we have the largest gaps presently.
  * Co-Inspiring - Utilize mindfulness and presencing to connect decision-makers to deep sources of knowing, both individually and collectively.
  * Prototyping, or Exploring the Future By Doing - Stop worrying about what you don't know and start acting on what you do know. Requires dedicated core group with a network of supportive stakeholders and users, a "0.8" prototype (incomplete, but elicits feedback), firm resolve to push forward while integrating feedback, review sessions for all protototypes (conclude what has been learned, take out what isn't working, strengthen what is working).
* Stages of Conversation:
  * Level 1: conforming, or projecting and confirming your existing judgements onto others
  * Level 2: confronting, or surfacing the differences that stakeholders hold as they view the issue from very different angles.
  * Level 3: connecting, or holding different views simultaneously, attending to the observing self - helping a system to see itself (dialogue).
  * Level 4: co-creative flow: attending to sources of creativity and self - helping a system connect to its emerging future self.

# Leading the Institutional Inversion: Toward Eco-Systems Economies

* If you are part of a system whose vital components operate in silos, connect them. Shift locus of leadership from the center to the periphery. Connect these places in ways that facilitate sense-making in more distributed, direct, and dialogic ways.
* Structural evolution:
  * Pyramid - power is centralized at the top.
  * Decentralized - power moves nearer to the bottom
  * Networked - power becomes relational
  * Inverted Pyramid - power moves to surrounding sphere of co-creative relationships
* Government Progression: centralized ruler-centric, abstract/differentiated machine bureaucracy, networked goverment paying attention to citizens, distributed/direct/dialogic system connecting and empowering citizens to co-shape the whole.
* Democracy Progression: one party (centralized), multiparty indirect (parliamentary), participatory indirect (parliamentary), participatory direct/distributed/digital/dialogic (4-D)
* Economic Progression:
  * Control over entire value chain, economies of scope, focus on vertical integration (ie old IBM).
  * Profit, economies of scale, focus on horizontal integration (ie Intel, Microsoft)
  * Eco-system domination, network economies (ie Apple, Facebook, Google)
  * Eco-system stewardship, economies of presencing
* Difference between eco-system domination and eco-system stewardship is intention.
* NGO Progression: alleviating actors (donor-dependent), policy advocates (donor-dependent), multistakeholder or social mission enterprises (partly self-funding), eco-system innovation enterprises (partly or wholly self-funding).
* Banking Progression: traditional banking, casino banking, socially responsible banking, transformative eco-system banking
* Principles:
  * Openness - Shift leadership from inside organization to surrounding sphere.
  * Transparency - Information must be transparent, not secret.
  * Sharing - Ownership of goods must be accessible and intelligently shared.
  * Intention - Organizing revolves around common intention, not structures.
  * Holding Space - Co-creative communities require high-quality core groups and holding spaces.
  * Conversation - Shift from toxic/transactional to dialogic/co-creative.
  * Awareness - Shift from ego-system to eco-system awareness.
  * Commons - Identify, protect, and cultivate commons as base of the whole eco-system.
  * Playfulness - Create a culture that values playfulness, entrepreneurship, and co-creation.
  * Diversity and Symbiosis - Twin principles that allow eco-systems to thrive.

# Leading from the Emerging Future

* 7 elements of University 4.0
  * Global classroom
  * Deep dives into inspiring local, regional, and global innovation hot spots.
  * Awareness-based leadership technologies.
  * Presencing coaching circles.
  * Action learning - co-creating hands-on prototype solutions that are helpful to a specific community or stakeholder constellation
  * Innovation hubs - inverts traditional campus (organized around discipline-based schools) putting emerging future opportunities at the center and organizing disciplines/tools around them.
  * Individualized lifelong learning journeys - today most education is when you need little or none (early in life and career, when you have little experience), while offering little later when your appetite for learning and experience are much greater.
* To facilitate profound innovation learners and leaders need practice fields - new, safe spaces that allow them to protype new behaviors, new mindsets, and new cultures of collaborating across borders.
* The Presencing Institute provides creative-commons based resources around the evolution of this framework and its practical methods and tools.

# Leading from the Emerging Future: From Ego-System to Eco-System Economies by Otto Scharmer and Katrin Kaufer
- shift from an ego-system awareness that cares about the well-being of oneself to an eco-system awareness that cares about the well-being of all, including oneself. (2)
- the two things that appear to be deeply frozen and unchanged are our collective habits of thought and the actions that they produce and reproduce in our world. (2)
- This book is a quest to answer three interrelated questions: 1. In the face of disruption, how do we lead from the emerging future? 2. What evolutionary economic framework can guide our journey forward? 3. What strategies can help us to function as vehicles for shifting the whole? (3)
- iceberg model (3)
- beneath the visible level of events and crises, there are underlying structures, mental models, and sources that are responsible for creating them. If ignored, they will keep us locked into reenacting the same old patterns time and again. (3)
- This symptoms level is a whole landscape of issues and pathologies that constitute three “divides”: what we call the ecological divide, the social divide, and the spiritual-cultural divide. (4)
- the spiritual-cultural divide reflects a disconnect between self and Self—that is, between one’s current “self” and the emerging future “Self” that represents one’s greatest potential. (4)
- Today we realize that this silo-type approach—dealing with one symptom cluster at a time—isn’t working. On the contrary, it seems to be part of the problem. (5)
- These bubbles and structural disconnects produce systems that are designed to not learn. The systems operate through delayed or broken feedback loops that prevent decision-makers from experiencing and personally feeling the impact of their decisions. (7)
- As a result, institutions tend to change too little and too late. (8)
- POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES FLOW TO THE TOP, NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES TO THE POOR (8)
- MONEY FLOWS THE WRONG WAY (9)
- Thus, in an externality-unaware financial system like the one we have today, money flows the wrong way: Those who are innovative, step into new ideas, or even work intentionally with lower returns in order to create societal benefits pay the highest prices, while those who may already have more than they really need pay the lowest prices. (9)
- GOVERNANCE IS DRIVEN BY SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS (10)
- Mental Models That Give Rise to Systemic Bubbles and Disconnects (11)
- As Albert Einstein put it so eloquently: “We cannot solve problems with the same kind of thinking that created them.” (11)
- The eight disconnects that we listed above represent a decoupling of two worlds: a decoupling of the structure of societal reality from the structure of economic thought. We could also say that they’re a decoupling of the structures of eco-system reality from the structures of ego-system awareness. (11)
- What is missing from how this story unfolded is a moment of reflective disruption in which all players would have come together, looked in the mirror, and realized what they were doing to themselves. (13)
- The blind spot of our time is that we take mainstream economic thought for granted, as if it were a natural law. But in reality, all so-called economic laws begin to melt and morph into something else the moment you begin to change the most important variable: the quality of awareness of the participants in a system. (15)
- The journey from ego-system to eco-system awareness, or from “me” to “we,” has three dimensions: (1) better relating to others; (2) better relating to the whole system; and (3) better relating to oneself. These three dimensions require participants to explore the edges of the system and the self. (16)
- Exploring the edges of the system means going to the place of most potential: (16)
- Exploring the edges of the self means shifting the inner place from which one operates. It means opening the mind, the heart, and the will. (16)
- The gist of this framework is simple: The quality of results produced by any system depends on the quality of awareness from which people in the system operate. (18)
- Presencing is a blended word combining sensing (feeling the future possibility) and presence (the state of being in the present moment). It means sensing and actualizing one’s highest future possibility—acting from the presence of what is wanting to emerge. (19)
- Principles of Presencing (21)
- 1. Energy follows attention. (21)
- 2. Follow the three movements of the U. (21)
- a. Going down the U: Observe, observe, observe. Stop downloading and totally immerse yourself in the places of most potential, in the places that matter most to the situation you are dealing with. (21)
- b. At the bottom of the U: Retreat and reflect; allow the inner knowing to emerge. (21)
- c. Going up the U: Act in an instant. Explore the future by doing. Develop a prototype. (21)
- 3. Go to the edges of the self. (22)
- With an open mind, we can suspend old habits of thought. With an open heart, we can empathize, or see a situation through the eyes of someone else. With an open will, we can let go and let the new come. (22)
- 4. Pass through the eye of the needle. (22)
- Going through that gate means encountering the two root questions of our journey: “Who is my Self?” and “What is my Work?” The capital-S Self is our highest future possibility. The capital-W Work is our sense of purpose or calling. (22)
- 5. Transform the three enemies. (23)
- the moment we commit ourselves to going on this journey, we start to encounter our three principal enemies: the voice of doubt and judgment (VoJ: shutting down the open mind), the voice of cynicism (VoC: shutting down the open heart), and the voice of fear (VoF: shutting down the open will). (23)
- 6. Always start by “attending to the crack.” (23)
- “Attending to the crack” means attending to the openings, the challenges, and the disruptions where we feel the past ending and the future wanting to begin. (23)
- 7. Hold the space for transforming the fields of conversation from debate to dialogue and collective creativity. (23)
- 8. Strengthen the sources of presencing in order to avoid the destructive dynamics of absencing. (23)
- absencing throws us into a trajectory of denial (not seeing what is going on), de-sensing (lacking empathy with the other), absencing (losing the connection to one’s higher Self), delusion (being guided by illusions), and destruction (destroying others and ourselves). (32)
- Thus, being thrown into the space of absencing means getting stuck in the tyrannies of 1. One Truth (ideology) 2. One “Us” versus “Them” (rigid collectivism) 3. One Will (fanaticism) The triple tyranny of “One Truth, One Us, One Will” is also referred to as fundamentalism. (32)
- As discussed in the introduction, these issue areas share common characteristics. Among them are that they (1) embody systemic structures that are designed not to learn; (2) are unaware of externalities; (3) facilitate money flowing the wrong way; and (4) allow special-interest groups to rig the system to the disadvantage of the whole. (47)
- If a GDP increase in developed countries does little to increase the well-being of its citizens, what does improve their welfare? Surprisingly, the leverage to increase well-being seems to be connected to reducing the size of one of the above-mentioned issue bubbles: inequality. (48)
- SOCIETY 1.0: ORGANIZING AROUND HIERARCHY (51)
- The core characteristic of this stage of societal development is a strong central actor that holds the decision-making power of the whole. (51)
- The positive accomplishment of a state-driven society, which we call Society 1.0, is its stability. The central power creates structure and order and calms the random violence that preceded it. The downsides of Society 1.0 are its lack of dynamism and, in most cases, its lack of nurturing individual initiative and freedom. (53)
- SOCIETY 2.0: ORGANIZING AROUND COMPETITION (53)
- Awareness during this stage of development—Society 2.0—can be described as an awakening ego-system awareness in which the self-interest of economic players acts as the animating or driving force. The bright side of this stage is the burst in entrepreneurial initiative. The dark side of this stage includes negative externalities such as unbounded commodification and its unintended side effects, including child labor, human trafficking, environmental destruction, and increased socioeconomic inequality. (53)
- The two main sources of power at this stage are state-based coercive legal and military power (sticks) and market-based remunerative power (carrots). (54)
- SOCIETY 3.0: ORGANIZING AROUND INTEREST GROUPS (54)
- There are three essential limitations of Society 3.0: It is biased in favor of special-interest groups, it reacts mostly to negative externalities, and it has only a limited capacity for intentionally creating positive externalities. (55)
- Since the governance mechanisms of a 3.0 society give power to organized interest groups, they systematically disadvantage all groups that cannot organize as easily because they are too large (e.g., consumers, taxpayers, citizens) or because they do not yet have a voice (future generations). (55)
- SOCIETY 4.0: ORGANIZING AROUND THE EMERGING WHOLE (55)
- Society 1.0 deals with the challenge of stability. The next challenge is growth (2.0), followed by externalities (3.0). Each challenge requires society to respond by creating a new coordination mechanism. (55)
- Society 1.0 has an ideology of state-centric core beliefs (state planning). Society 2.0 adopts a market-centered set of core beliefs (market competition). Society 3.0 operates according to a communication- or discourse-centric set of beliefs that typically integrates both markets and government (56)
- The blind spot in the twentieth-century toolkit of economics and management can be summarized in a single word: consciousness. (67)
- While the first economic concepts saw the economy as being firmly integrated in the larger societal whole, modern economics conceive of the economy as an autonomous subsystem in the larger societal whole. (70)
- economic monotheism that puts the primacy of one coordination mechanism atop all economic activities: the invisible hand of the market. (70)
- In a primitive political system, according to Johnson, power is transmitted through violence (71)
- In a more developed society, power is transmitted through money (71)
- But in the most advanced societies, power is transmitted through cultural capital, such as belief systems (71)
- What, then, is the driving force for moving an economy or a society from one operating system to another? We believe that there are two primary ones: exterior challenges (the push factor) and the development of consciousness (the pull factor). (73)
- How can we rethink and redesign our economic processes in ways that will reintegrate economic cycles with nature? (79)
- 1. All economic activity arises from and returns to nature. (80)
- 2. Commodity fiction. (80)
- In all modern economic theory, nature is thought of as a commodity. (80)
- 3. Biomimicry. (81)
- a. Zero waste. (81)
- b. Solar energy. (81)
- c. Diversity and symbiosis. (81)
- 4. Closed-Loop Designs. (81)
- 1. The discourse of denial. The public debate over deficit reduction and the promise of future growth that would bring back the industrial jobs that went to China and India all argue that we are just in another cyclical downturn that will be solved as soon as the recession ends. (84)
- 2. The myth of growth. One argument that has caused the debate to stagnate is the assumption that we will solve our economic woes over the next two or three decades through accelerated growth. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a delusional myth for at least three reasons: (85)
- a. Ecological limits. (85)
- b. Social limits. (85)
- c. Jobless growth. (85)
- 3. The myth of money. What is it that drives teachers, entrepreneurs, engineers, and others to do their best work? It’s the connection to their inner source of inspired creative energy. (86)
- 4. Relinking work and entrepreneurship. (86)
- These infrastructures combine the following elements and provide access to: 1. enabling spaces: innovation happens in nurturing places 2. key challenges: challenges are the raw material for all learning 3. sensing mechanisms that allow people to see themselves as part of a bigger picture 4. capacity-building mechanisms 5. capital 6. technology 7. community: a global web of mentors, partners, and entrepreneurs who collectively create prototypes for Society 4.0 (87)
- If the answer is yes, then a high-leverage economic intervention point would be to simply create an economic human right to basic income for every human being on the planet. (87)
- 1. The financial system is too efficient. (95)
- It focuses too narrowly on short-term financial profitability, with no awareness of its negative side effects on people and the planet. (95)
- 2. Money is not capital. (95)
- It is the force of creativity: individual and collective creativity, which we believe is the ultimate source of all capital and value creation. (96)
- 3. Money is not a commodity. (96)
- The main purpose of money 4.0 and capital 4.0 is to relink the creation of money with entrepreneurial intention in our communities. (97)
- A 4.0 system would put these principles to work. The flows of money and capital would be redirected from the US$190 trillion bubble of profit-seeking capital into those sectors of society that today are underfunded—basically, the whole regenerative side of the economy: innovation, education, health, sustainability, and the environmental, social, and cultural commons. (98)
- 4. Money does not equal money. (99)
- Any transfer of money is not only a technical act, but is also mirrored in the real economy through one of four actions: (99)
- a. Making a speculative transaction. (99)
- b. Making a purchase. (99)
- c. Making a loan. (99)
- d. Making a gift. (99)
- Contrary to conventional wisdom, gift money often generates the highest productivity over the long term because it allows recipients to radically sense and actualize the emerging future, rather than satisfying the expectations of funders or other stakeholders who tend to driven by viewpoints and indicators of the past. (100)
- 1. new tools to monitor and measure a comprehensive economic and social impact across all four levels of money and its uses (speculating, purchasing, lending, and gifting) to increase transparency and awareness on impact; (102)
- 2. a concept of capital that relinks the actual creation of capital with its source: the collective creativity of all actors in an economic community; (103)
- 3. a concept of money that debunks the commodity fiction and makes the creation of money transparent and aligned with the entrepreneurial intention in a community; and (103)
- 4. a healthier balance among the four spheres of money-related actions, achieved by eliminating level 1 (the casino economy) and strengthening level 4 (the gift economy) in order to allow more people to tap and realize their full entrepreneurial potential. (103)
- 1. Debunk the liberation myth. (106)
- Summing up: Whether technology is a force of liberation or a force of dependency depends on the inner place—the quality of awareness—from which we operate. (106)
- 2. Debunk the technology-fix myth. (107)
- Despite technology’s many failures, the belief that it can magically solve our global and local crises around water, food, energy, health, and sustainability is as strong as ever. (107)
- 3. Relink R&D investments with pressing societal needs. (107)
- 4. Lead the third Industrial Revolution. (108)
- the fundamental criterion for future public policy and public investment in technology could be this: Does the use of a specific technology improve or stifle our creativity? (108)
- We all know what the absence of leadership looks like: We collectively create results that nobody wants. (110)
- Three Leadership Myths (112)
- Myth 1: The leader is the guy at the top. (112)
- In order to face today’s leadership challenges, many, many people in the organization—sometimes everyone—need to be involved. (112)
- Myth 2: Leadership is about individuals. (112)
- Myth 3: Leadership is about creating and communicating a vision. The problem with this myth is that it focuses primarily on broadcasting a message rather than on something much more important: listening. (113)
- The Missing Mechanism: Collective Sensing and Prototyping (113)
- this process of helping diverse stakeholder groups in eco-systems to sense and actualize future possibilities requires new infrastructures or holding spaces for five critical process steps: (1) co-initiating, i.e., helping stakeholders in fragmented systems to connect and discover common ground; (2) co-sensing, i.e., helping people to walk in each other’s shoes, to see the system from the edges, and to develop capacities for collective sensing; (3) co-inspiring through deep reflection practices and intentional moments of stillness that help us to connect to our deeper sources of knowing; (4) co-creating, or exploring the future through hands-on prototyping; and (5) co-evolving, or scaling and sustaining the new. (115)
- 6. Consumption: Relinking the Economy with Well-Being (115)
- Myth 1: Production and consumption are separate. (117)
- Nothing is wrong. Except that the customer stands at the end of the process, and his or her needs don’t mark the beginning of the production sequence. (117)
- The consumer is a target of economic activity rather than a partner whose evolving needs are being identified and served. (117)
- Myth 2: Consumers are separate from one another. (118)
- Myth 3: Material consumption creates well-being. (119)
- How do we see the 4.0 future of empowered, conscious, collaborative consumers emerging? There are four driving forces. (120)
- The first is technology. The World Wide Web continues to revolutionize the economy by providing easy access to information and thereby to a more level playing field. (120)
- A second driving force is awareness: More and more people have a desire to participate in lifestyles that are healthy, mindful, and sustainable. (120)
- A third driving force is the increasing intensity of disruption and breakdown. (121)
- A fourth driving force has to do with economic human rights. More and more people around the world find it unacceptable that we operate a US$60 trillion economy and yet are unable to reduce the number of people who live in poverty. (121)
- Both the visible hand of central planning and the invisible hand of decentralized markets have one thing in common: They do not require the individual decision-maker to consider the well-being of the whole. (122)
- 1. The antagonism of markets versus hierarchies is a myth. (125)
- 2. The answer to “either-or” is “both-and.” (126)
- 3. An economy is not a business. There are at least two important differences between an economy and a business: (1) An economy cannot walk away from its community of citizens;62 and (2) it has to internalize all of its externalities. (126)
- 4. ABC closes the feedback loop between parts and whole. The evolutionary threshold we are facing with capitalism today concerns the birth of a new coordination mechanism, one that complements the existing three mechanisms (hierarchy, markets, and negotiation) and builds the capacity of the whole system to see, sense, and regenerate itself. We call this new capacity ABC—awareness-based collective action—because it arises from places that facilitate the capacity of the system to see itself, to sense what wants to emerge, and to explore the future by doing (prototyping). (127)
- Property rights are a bundle of rights and responsibilities that are legally enforceable. These rights include (1) access, (2) use, (3) management, (4) exclusion, and (5) alienation (the right to sell). (128)
- All Ownership Forms Are Socially Constructed (132)
- Myth 1: Only private property rights are efficient; other forms are not. (132)
- Myth 2: There is no third form of ownership. A second myth is that public and private are the only two forms of ownership and that there is no third form. (133)
- We Need Commons-Based Property Rights (133)
- Commons-based property rights would be institutionalized through trusts and trustees accountable to all stakeholder groups in the eco-system, including future generations, to act as stewards of the whole. (134)
- A trust and its independent trustees are accountable for the long-term sustainability of the specific commons that they manage for the next generation. (134)
- Shared Ownership Is Rising (134)
- He synthesized that fundamental process of becoming aware as a sequence of crossing three thresholds: suspension, redirection, and letting go. (146)
- 1. Suspension: Stopping and suspending old habits of judgment and thought is a precondition for the first phase of the work. It requires breaking habitual patterns and starting to pay attention. (146)
- 2. Redirection: After suspending the patterns of the past and the habit of downloading, there is a need to start seeing reality from a different angle. This requires listening to the views and experiences of others, taking them in as part of seeing current reality from a multiplicity of views. (146)
- 3. Letting go: Then, if we are lucky, we will go through a profound moment of “quieting” that allows us to let go of our old self and connect with another state of being, a state that helps us to become aware of who we really are and what we are here for. (146)
- We can change reality by changing the inner place from which we operate. The Matrix of Social Evolution (and the rest of this book) spells out what this looks like for an individual (attending), a group (conversing), an institution (organizing), and a global system (coordinating). (146)
- On level 1, the quality of listening is called downloading. Same old, same old! The listener hears ideas, and these merely reconfirm what the listener already knows. (147)
- On level 2, listening is called factual listening, which is what good scientists do. They do not hold on to existing interpretations of reality, but they let the data talk to them. (147)
- listening is getting inside social complexity. This happens at level 3, which we call empathic listening. Empathic listening allows the individual to see reality from the perspective of the other and sense the other person’s circumstances. (147)
- Level 4 is generative listening. Generative listening means to form a space of deep attention that allows an emerging future possibility to “land” or manifest. It is what great coaches do: They listen deeply in a way that allows you to connect to your emerging future self. (147)
- As individuals, we must begin to pay attention to our attention (self-awareness); as teams, we must begin to converse about our conversations (dialogue); as enterprises, we must begin to organize our organizing (networks of networks: eco-systems); and as eco-systems, we must begin to coordinate our coordinating (systems of awareness-based collective action, or ABC). (149)
- Listening 1 (habitual): projecting old judgments Listening 2 (factual): directing the beam of observation onto the world around us Listening 3 (empathic): adopting the other person’s perspective and therefore seeing ourselves through the eyes of the other (bending the beam) Listening 4 (generative): listening from the whole and the emerging new, which further turns the beam of observation onto the deep sources of Self (154)
- Condition 1: Bending the Beam of Observation (161)
- They each tell the story of bending the beam of attention back onto its source. The beam first radiated into the outside world (level 2), then bent back onto the self (level 3), and then found the sources of self, of becoming present in the moment, in the now (level 4). (161)
- Condition 2: A Holding Space for Embracing the Shadow (161)
- Condition 3: Going to the Edge of Letting Go (162)
- The third condition of possibility concerns the willingness to go to the edge of the abyss, to let go, to lean into the unknown—and take the leap. (162)
- We conclude this chapter with twelve principles and practices that can help advance our individual journey from self to Self, from me to We, as exemplified in the stories shared above. (169)
- 1. Practice, don’t preach. (169)
- 2. Observe, observe, observe: Become a blackbelt observer and listener. (169)
- 3. Connect to your intention as an instrument. (170)
- 4. When the crack opens up, stay with it—connect and act from the now. (170)
- 5. Follow your heart—do what you love, love what you do. (170)
- 6. Always be in dialogue with the universe. (170)
- 7. Create a holding space of deep listening that supports your journey. (170)
- Two of the most effective mechanisms to strengthen your capacity to access your emerging Self are cultivation practices and deep-listening-based circle work. (171)
- 8. Iterate, iterate, iterate. (171)
- 9. Notice the crack to the field of the future. (171)
- 10. Use different language with different stakeholders. (171)
- 11. If you want to change others (other stakeholders), you need to be open to changing yourself first. (171)
- 12. Never give up. Never give up. You are not alone. (172)
- To make that shift, we need to bend the beam of conversational attention back to its source. Instead of just seeing others, we need to learn how to see ourselves through the eyes of others and of the whole. (174)
- I noted that the participants had three habitual reactions of avoidance that prevented the consequences of their actions from sinking in deeply: (1) denial, (2) cynicism, and (3) depression. (174)
- Conversations Create the World (175)
- LEVEL 1: UNILATERAL, ONE-WAY DOWNLOADING, AND MANIPULATING Level 1 stakeholder communication is unilateral, one-way downloading with the intent to manipulate, rather than to serve the well-being of, the other side. (177)
- LEVEL 2: BILATERAL, TWO-WAY DISCUSSIONS, AND EXCHANGE OF VIEWPOINTS Level 2 stakeholder communication is a bilateral, two-way discussion with the intent to provide and receive information, and includes a response or feedback mechanism. (177)
- LEVEL 3: MULTILATERAL STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE: SEEING ONESELF THROUGH THE EYES OF ANOTHER Level 3 stakeholder communication is a multilateral conversation characterized by reflection, learning, and dialogue. (177)
- LEVEL 4: CO-CREATIVE ECO-SYSTEM INNOVATION: BLURRING THE BOUNDARY OF EGO AND ECO Level 4 stakeholder communication is a multilateral, collectively creative eco-system conversation that helps diverse groups of players to co-sense and co-create the future by transforming awareness from ego to eco. (178)
- the main leverage points are today for shifting the system to a better way of operating: 1. We need to get rid of the toxic layer of level 1 communication (bribery, soft money, commercials, and other forms of propaganda and manipulation that keep intoxicating the communication channels of our society today). 2. And we need to develop new spheres of level 4 co-creative stakeholder relationships, in which partners in an eco-system can come together to co-sense, prototype, and co-create the future of their eco-system. (179)
- The deep principle should be “Energy follows attention.” A mindset that is only about fixing a problem or closing a gap puts limits on creativity. (186)
- These problems invite us to redraw the boundaries of competition and cooperation by introducing arenas of premarket cooperation among all sectors. (187)
- What do you do when you are part of a system whose vital components operate in separate silos? Answer: You connect them. You shift the locus of leadership from the center to the periphery—that is, from one place to many places. You connect these places in ways that facilitate sense-making in more distributed, direct, and dialogic ways. (191)
- stages of economic development and its underlying logic. The purpose of the 1.0 company is control over the entire value chain. The logic revolves around economies of scope; the focus is on vertical integration (for example, the old IBM). The purpose of the 2.0 company is profit. The logic revolves around economies of scale, and the focus is on horizontal integration (for example, Intel and Microsoft). The purpose of the 3.0 company is eco-system domination. The logic revolves around network economies. Examples are Apple, Facebook, and Google. The purpose of the 4.0 company is eco-system stewardship. The logic revolves around economies of presencing—that is, around sensing and actualizing emerging futures. (225)
- The difference between 3.0 and 4.0 companies is intention: 3.0 companies are driven to dominate their eco-system, while 4.0 companies try to serve the well-being and shared ownership of all. (226)
- 1.0: NGOs: alleviating actors, donor-dependent 2.0: NGOs: policy advocates, donor-dependent 3.0: NGOs: multistakeholder or social mission enterprises, partly self-funding 4.0: NGOs: eco-system innovation enterprises, partly or fully self-funding (226)
- 1. Openness: Leadership shifts from inside an organization to the surrounding sphere. 2. Transparency: Information must be transparent, not secret. 3. Sharing: Ownership of goods must be accessible and intelligently shared. 4. Intention: Organizing revolves around common intention, not structures. 5. Holding space: Co-creative communities require high-quality core groups and holding spaces. 6. Conversation: Shift from levels 1 and 2 (toxic, transactional) to levels 3 and 4 (dialogic, co-creative). 7. Awareness: Shift the primary mode of operating from ego-system to eco-system awareness. 8. Commons: Identify, protect, and cultivate the commons as base of the whole eco-system. 9. Playfulness: Create a culture that values playfulness, entrepreneur-ship, and co-creation. 10. Diversity and symbiosis: These are the twin principles that allow eco-systems to thrive. (236)
- At the outset of this book we posed three questions: 1. In the face of disruption, how do we lead from the emerging future? 2. What evolutionary economic framework can guide our journey forward? 3. What strategies can help us to function as vehicles for shifting the whole? In exploring these questions, we laid out three big ideas. (239)
- The first is that there are two fundamentally different modes of learning: learning from the past and learning from the emerging future. (239)
- The second big idea concerns the Matrix of Economic Evolution (table 3). The matrix suggests that the evolution of economic structures follows the evolution of human consciousness—or, to be more precise, that they are highly interdependent. (239)
- The third big idea is that the next revolution will require a multipoint strategy that, from a mundo or system perspective, focuses on all eight acupuncture points laid out by the Matrix of Economic Evolution. (240)
- The source is, from a systems view, where the feedback loop between mind and matter closes in the now, both individually and collectively. We have called these “closing-in” points or acupuncture points. This is how it happens for each of the eight acupuncture points: (240)
- 1. Nature: Close the feedback loop of production, consumption, reuse, and recycling (through “earth-to-earth” or closed-loop design). (241)
- 2. Labor: Close the feedback loop from work (jobs) to Work (passion) by building new entrepreneurship infrastructures that ignite the connection between self and Self. (241)
- 3. Capital: Close the feedback loop in the flow of capital by redirecting speculative investment into ecological, social, and cultural-creative renewal (through gift money and intentional capital). (241)
- 4. Technology: Close the feedback loop from technology creation to societal needs, particularly in underserved markets (through needs assessment and participatory planning). (241)
- 5. Leadership: Close the feedback loop from leadership to the emerging future of the whole (through practices of co-sensing, co-inspiring, and co-creating). (241)
- 6. Consumption: Close the feedback loop from economic output to the well-being of all (through conscious, collaborative consuming and new indicators such as GNH, or gross national happiness, discussed later in this chapter). (241)
- 7. Coordination: Close the feedback loop in the economy from the parts to the whole (through ABC, awareness-based collective action). (241)
- 8. Ownership: Close the feedback loop from ownership rights to the best societal use of assets (through shared ownership and commons-based property rights that safeguard the interests of future generations). (241)
- Here are the seven elements that we see merging in what could be called University 4.0: (243)
- 1. Global classroom. (243)
- 2. Deep dives into inspiring local, regional, and global hot spots of innovation. (243)
- 3. Awareness-based leadership technologies. (243)
- 4. Presencing coaching circles. (243)
- 5. Action learning. (244)
- co-create hands-on prototype solutions that are helpful to a specific community or stakeholder constellation. (244)
- 6. Innovation hubs. (244)
- While a traditional campus is organized around discipline-based schools that deal separately with societal challenges and issues, an innovation hub is an inversion of that principle: It puts the emerging future opportunities at the center and organizes the disciplines and tools around them. (244)
- 7. Individualized lifelong learning journeys. (244)
- Today’s educational structure offers you all your training when you need little or none—early in your life and career, when your experience base is small—while offering you very little later, when your appetite for learning and your experience base are much greater. (245)
- In order to facilitate profound innovation like helping eco-systems shift to 4.0, learners and leaders need practice fields—that is, new and safe spaces that allow them to prototype new behaviors, new mindsets, and new cultures of collaborating across boundaries. (245)
- The Presencing Institute also operates a creative commons–based website that shares the further evolution of this framework and its practical methods and tools. (247)
- What strategies can help us to function as vehicles for the future that wants to emerge? We know that we need to (252)
- 1. bend the beam of attention back to its source in order to cultivate generative relationships and advance the movement of institutional inversion as individuals, groups, and organizations; (252)
- 2. focus on all eight acupuncture points to update the economic and societal logic of operating to 4.0; and (252)
- 3. shift the global field of entrepreneurship by creating a multiregional network of “hubs” that support the capacity of the next generation of entrepreneurs to build intentional eco-system economies on a scale that meets the challenges of our time (U.school). (252)
- There are three specific streams or movements that are beginning to come together now: (253)
- • global civil society, in the tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King; (253)
- • action science, as represented by Kurt Lewin and Ed Schein; (253)
- • mindfulness and awareness, inherent in the essence of all wisdom traditions, as exemplified and articulated by my conversation with Master Nan and Francisco Varela (253)
