# The Surprising Science of Meetings

* Ideal venue to bring together ideas, thoughts, and opinions - so that everyone can work in a more coordinated and cooperative manner.
* Meetings help employees connect, voice their opinions, tackle problems, and create shared understanding.
* Meeting build commitment to goals, initiatives, and broader aspirations which may not be stated in individual job descriptions. Employees can also see they are part of something bigger than themselves.
* Meetings bring people together, gain input, promote discussion, promet synergy, provide voice, explain things, coordinate, foster ownership, and learn and grow as a unit. Bringing people together as a coherent whole, helps them be more adaptive, resilient, and self-directing, especially in the face of crises.
* Holding too few meetings robs employees of inclusion, support, voice, and community.
* Allow attendees to interpersonally connect, building relationships, networks, and most importantly, support.
* Poorly conducted meetings are a form of preventable time theft.
* Provide adequate training to those both in and not in leadership already. Consider simulation, similar to what is available in some academic programs and online.

## Summary

* Small, positive changes can lead to palpable gains over time.
* As a leader, if you visualize the meeting, flow, key needs, and key challenges in advance, you will improve the chances of ultimate success. Alternatively/additionally, consider "premortem" to help guide preperation.
* Good meeting design requires a host of decisions, which should be purposely made, rather than decided out of habit and tradition.
* Ask attendees for input on the agenda to increase specificity and also accountability.
* Determine how many people are needed, then provide nonessential personnel other more appropriate opportunities to be involved.
* Leader manages crucial meeting dynamics: engaging all attendees, asking the right questions, modeling active listening, drawing out input, playing traffic officer, and managing emergent conflict.
* As meetings can be experienced as interruption, work to promote positivity from the moment attendees arrive.
* Offer purposeful opening statements, offer appreciation for attendees work and contributions, and remind attendees of "meeting values".
* Periodically evaluate regular meetings.
* Meetings, like many things, should follow an arc of try, reflect, and learn. This also communicates willingness to experiment, take risks, and grow.

## Good Meeting Leadership

* Most people likely overestimate their meeting leadership skills.
* Leaders need meeting skill and facilitation training to understand what excellent meeting behavior looks like and foster self-awareness.
* Leaders need ongoing feedback to continue to improve. Look to include in employee engagement surveys and 360-degree feedback surveys.
* Leaders should evaluate their standing meetings at least once per quarter, likely via survey.
* Leaders should aspire to servant-and-giver mindset, truly owning others' experiences of the meeting, and recognizing their responsibility to make meetings a good use of time.
* Make increasing meeting leadership an organizational priority (don't try to make these improvements alone).

## Meeting Duration

* We often default to 30 or 60 minute meetings regardless of need, and resulting meetings tend to grow to fill the allotted time (Parkinson's Law).
* Organizations can override the 30/60 minute defaults with their own standards (ie 25/50 minute meetings in gcal).
* After choosing an appropriate duration, consider cutting an additional 5-10%. This applies eustress, helps keep things focused, facilitates transitions, etc.
* Don't shy away from unusual durations, if that is the right fit for the discussion at hand.
* Never be afraid to end early if goals have been met, or the meeting is no longer productive (in the later case, stopping and regrouping later or in another medium may help).
* Sometimes 10-15 minute meetings can be an effective way to quickly debrief or reflect.
* Brief huddles can be used to strategize, discuss, monitor, motivate, or celebrate. This is not to report to the leader, but instead for team members to communicate with one another, pull together, learn together, and seek ways to support each other.
* Huddles often set the table for other, deeper conversations

## Meetings as Events

* Agendas are unlikely to make a difference on their own, particularly when recycled from meeting to meeting.
* Meetings are events, and should be planned as such, carefully considering details, flow, experience, and approach.
* Start by considering what needs to be accomplished for a meeting to be successful, it should require genuine interaction among and engagement from attendees (else another medium would likely be more efficient).
* Soliciting agenda input from atteendees and interested parties helps ensure critical topics are covered and helps build buy-in/engagement (likely solicit via email 3-5 days in advance). It may also help to ask for reasoning around why something should be included.
* After identifying potential topics and goals, carefully reflect on goals and decide what adds value beyond it's opportunity cost, dropping anything that doesn't make the cut. Also drop content that is only relevant to a subset of attendees (this content is best pursued in a different context).
* Delegating responsibility, such as by giving certain agenda items owners (in charge of discussion, and often post-meeting action) fosters accountability and distributes load.
* Seek to distribute final agenda 2-3 days in advance, cancelling at this time if you don't have compelling topics.
* Focus agendas around questions, rather than statements.

## Meeting Flow

* Items earlier in the agenda tend to get more time and attention, so front load the most critical items.
* End agenda with few minutes of wrap-up to cover meeting takeaways, clarify assignments, and note agenda items for next time. Occasionally ending with Q&A can also be helpful.
* You may want to group certain related items to tell a better "story".
* All else being equal, prioritize employee-generated/submitted agenda items to send a strong message around voice, inclusion, and shared ownership.
* Meeting should start on time and follow agenda, but sometimes "warm-up" items (ie quick announcements, updates from last meeting) can buffer late people and/or build momentum.

## Dividing up Meetings

* It can be helpful in ideation to use subteams to discuss, generate ideas, and draft preliminary solutions. A representative can then report back (with representative role rotating).
* Intervals can be helpful, with a short meeting, followed by a set time to async contribute, then after someone cleans/condenses the document voting on most promising ideas, a meeting to discuss top candidates, and a final round of voting on the best solution.
* Breaking meetings into two or more smaller parts can lead to higher-quality outcomes by counteracting a tendency toward premature consensus (as attendees often rally around the first reasonable solution/ideas generated).
* One good way of breaking up meetings to to have one meeting to discuss alternatives and another to make the decision.

## Meeting Size

* As meeting size grows, so do coordination challenges, and the probability of social loafing.
* Reducing meeting size can improve quality, and help prevent the erosion of engagement suffered by individuals who must attend irrelevant meetings.
* Start with the meeting goals, and consider: Who has info/knowledge about topics? Who are key decision makers and stakeholders? Who will need the information that is discussed? Who will implement or act upon decisions?
* Seek to have the leanest meeting possible given the goals at hand.
* For decision-making and problem-solving, seven or fewer is ideal (8-12 with outstanding facilitation).
* For idea generation, agenda setting, and huddles, fewer than fifteen is ideal.

## Inclusion without Attendance

* You could split up the agenda to allow multiple smaller, focused meetings.
* You could do time blocks with some attendees joining/leaving at certain times. For instance, initial items relevant to a large group, with many leaving before moving to more focused content.
* You could gather input before the meeting, in lieu of attendance.
  * Survey individuals in advance about topics to be discussed to get ideas about additional topics or their reactions to existing topics. Responses can be shared with and/or discussed by attendees.
  * Asking for input, even if none is subsequently provided it engenders feelings of support, buy-in, and inclusion.
  * Make it clear that even if they aren't an attendee now, they could be in the future.
* You could consider "representative voices" approach in which individuals are explicitly asked to represent groups of stakeholders. In this case, the representative should meeting with their group before hand, and keep them in the loop afterward.
  * Explicitly being assigned a role resulted in more commitment to action.
* Take detailed meeting notes to help attendees remember, recognize that what was said was heard correctly, and promote post meeting actions. Additionally, these can be shared with non-attendees to further foster inclusion.

## Breaking Rhythms

* Be wary of rituals becoming ruts, leading to stagnation.
* Trying new things conveys that you care and value controlled risk-taking and experimentation.
* Seating charts tend not to change, and can impact effectiveness, critical decision-making, creativity, enjoyment, and energy. Fluidity over time can allow you to experience the full range of possible dynamics.
* Walking meetings can change things up for small group discussions which do not need technology to drive the agenda.
* Standing meetings take about 34% less time than sit down meetings without impacting quality.

## Setting a Positive Tone

* Be a source of positive energy.
* Be a good host. Greet attendees, make introductions, point out common interests. The early social interactions you encourage and promote as leader influence the remainder of the meeting.
* Meetings are often experienced as an interruption, so to have a good experience, start by creating separation.
* Begin with passion, enthusiasm, vision, and direction. Make it clear why the attendees are there and what needs to get done.
* Consider 1-2 minutes of recognition, celebration, and appreciation (ideally collective accomplishments, though individual can be ok).
* Alternatively, ask each attendee to: recognize someone (or a group) who has helped them since the last meeting, recognize achievement/accomplishment of another person since last meeting. Just be sure to change up the prompts to keep things fresh/interesting.
* Positive mood states promote individual cognitive flexibility, resilience, well-being, and even creativity. The collective mood state also matters.
* Meeting with more humor and laughter have a greater propensity for socioemotional communication, constructive conversations, and novel solutions.
* Periodically a reminder of "meeting values" can also help create separation.
* Alternatively, you can ask attendees what expectations of norms/behaviors they would like to see from you as leader or others.
* Engagement Ideas: offer food, bring toys, establish technology policies, consider clicker quizzes, consider role playing beyond just devil's advocate, get attendees talking in pairs, consider stretching.

## Integrating Silence

* It is sometimes helpful to utilize silence in meetings, especially when generating and evaluating ideas.
* To be effective a meeting must tap into each attendee's relevant and critical knowledge, insights, and perspectives. Unfortunately by default, meetings tend to be dominated by shared information.
* Non-talking outperforms brainstorming:
  * Attendees can work in parallel, thus removing "production blocking" caused by only one person speaking at a time.
  * When silently writing ideas, attendees do not fear social humiliation (especially when anonymized).
  * Silent writing expects everyone to participate, reducing social loafing.
* Brainwriting
  * Attendees respond to a prompt with each idea on a piece of paper, submitted to the middle. If/when people run out of ideas, they can pull from the middle for possible inspiration.
  * Facilitator(s) sort the ideas into conceptually similar groups (during or possibly after idea generation meeting).
  * Group can then discuss which of these grouped ideas to discuss and flesh out in this or future meetings, or leaders can use voting to narrow down groups if there are too many.
  * Can expand on this by posting ideas and allowing written comments/thoughts/responses as well.
* Silent Reading
  * Well suited for agendas involving a proposal of an idea, concept, or initiative.
  * Reduces the influence of flash, personality, and speaking talent.
  * Demands presenter to think deeply and cogently about proposal before using other's time.
  * Reading generally followed by a vigorous discussion.
  * Generally senior managers hold comments until hearing from others to prevent prematurely swaying discussion.

## Phoning In

* Consider asking permission to be "taskmaster", firmly keeping conversation on track and calling on people as needed.
* Use people's names as much as possible, actively manage conversation flow, and draw remote attendees in.
* Try to direct questions and comments to specific individuals.
* The more anonymous individuals are, the more likely they are to social loaf.
* Assuming each attendee is truly needed, lack of complete engagement by remote attendees is clearly counterproductive.
* Consider "banning" the mute button, as with it multitasking becomes almost a foregone conclusion.
* Use chat so attendees can notify if they want to speak or if you missed something.
* Periodically follow up with attendees to get suggestions for further improvement.
* Try to find additional opportunities for attendee face time with each other to build trust, foster connections, promote empathy, learn from others, and understand humor styles.

# The Surprising Science of Meetings: How You Can Lead Your Team to Peak Performance by Steven G. Rogelberg
- Again, all roads lead to more meetings—the mechanism to bring people together, gain input, promote discussion, promote synergy, provide voice, explain things, coordinate, foster ownership, and learn and grow as a unit. (7)
- I will argue that the elimination of meetings in and of themselves is absolutely a false goal—the goal should actually be to eliminate ineffective and bloated meetings—it is still important to take stock of what meetings are implicitly and explicitly costing an organization, and what the return is on that investment. (8)
- We Need to Meet, and We Need to Meet Critical Needs (16)
- Holding too few meetings robs employees of essential information and feelings of inclusion, support, voice, and community. (16)
- A poorly conducted and unnecessary meeting is indeed a form of time theft, a theft that can be prevented. (20)
- Meetings help employees connect, voice their opinions, tackle problems, and create a shared understanding. (20)
- There is compelling evidence suggesting that we are poor judges of our own leadership skills when it comes to meetings. (25)
- This inflated perception, in turn, results in a sizable blind spot that likely prevents us from developing, improving, honing, and maximizing our ability to lead meetings. (25)
- we must not ignore the risk that poor meeting leadership skills will beget poor meeting leadership skills in others. (25)
- Human Bias in How We Perceive Ourselves (26)
- psychology professor David Myers coined the term the “Lake Wobegon Effect,” which refers to the robust human tendency to overestimate—relative to others—one’s knowledge, skills, abilities, and personality traits. In other words, most people believe they are well above average, which clearly is a statistical impossibility. (26)
- Focusing Back on Meeting Leadership (27)
- we found that the amount of participation or involvement in meetings correlated positively with perceptions of meeting effectiveness and satisfaction. (27)
- In other words, if you talk a lot, you are more likely to think the meeting experience was a good one. (28)
- What an Organization Can Do to Improve Leader Self-Awareness (28)
- First and foremost, to facilitate self-awareness, leaders need meaningful meeting skills and facilitation training. After all, if you don’t truly know what excellent meeting behaviors look like, you don’t have an internal (28)
- The second major prong to promoting self-awareness is feedback. (29)
- A company’s annual employee engagement and attitude survey must contain content on meetings in order to provide data on how leaders are doing. (29)
- Another opportunity for leader development and accountability is to conduct 360-degree feedback surveys that contain some content on meetings. (29)
- How Can Leaders Take Control of Their Meeting Leadership Skill Development? (30)
- Putting this informal scanning of cues aside, the best practice for you, as a leader, is to evaluate your standing meetings every three months or so. The evaluation should be quick and easy: a survey given to all attendees containing just a handful of questions. (31)
- What Image Do You Want to See? (34)
- The image you want to see—that is, the type of meeting leader you want to aspire to be—is one closely aligned with servant leadership. (34)
- A leader with a servant-and-giver mindset recognizes his or her unique responsibility to make the meeting a good use of time. (35)
- Such leaders recognize that, as leaders, they must truly own others’ experiences of the meeting. (35)
- They think carefully about the design and execution of the meeting, from soup to nuts—they never just “phone it in.” (35)
- Although these facilitation techniques are consistent with servant leadership and can certainly promote meeting success, none of this precludes a leader from being direct and assertive and moving the discussion forward actively if needed. (37)
- Overall, servant-and-giver meeting leaders take pride in being excellent stewards of others’ time and recognize that this is the path to their ultimate success, the success of others, and the success of the organization. (38)
- Putting It All Together (38)
- Leaders are just not as skilled as they often think they are. This problem is left unchecked because of inadequate assessment of the meetings themselves and of those who lead them. (38)
- The conclusion was that high self-awareness was an exceptional predictor of overall success. (38)
- The tools in this chapter can help you gain more self-awareness, which, with training, the right mindset, trial, error, and more feedback, will improve the way you work with your team and lead meetings. (40)
- Takeaways (40)
- 1. Realize—and embrace—the fact that you are likely not quite as good at leading meetings as you think you are. (40)
- 2. Given that we are likely to overestimate our abilities, take a pulse of your meeting leadership. (40)
- 3. Make increasing meeting leadership an organizational priority: start by suggesting that meetings be part of your 360-degree feedback for leaders; add a section to your yearly employee engagement survey on meetings. Do not try to make these improvements all on your own—make it a focus for everyone in order to create positive organizational change. (40)
- 4. Try to adopt a servant leadership and giver mindset in order to unleash collective talent in a meeting and to foster buy-in. (40)
- Cultural norms abound. They influence how we think, how we speak, what we do, how we engage with others, even how we raise our children. (41)
- Think about this for a moment: despite the fact that meetings vary greatly in purpose, scope, history, communication modality, and the number of attendees, they often are exactly one hour in length, and the sixty-minute meeting has been a cultural norm for decades. (41)
- Have Time, Will Fill It (42)
- In 1955, The Economist published a humorous essay titled “Parkinson’s Law.” (42)
- It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. (42)
- In the rest of this chapter, we will look at ways to more effectively set a meeting time so that it not only fits the task at hand but also creates reasonable pressure and poses a challenge the meeting attendees can rise up to. (43)
- Ultimately, decreasing a meeting’s length not only returns time to the attendees but also creates a positive form of pressure, in turn sharpening attendees’ focus and interest. (43)
- Decreasing Meeting Times Thoughtfully (44)
- A meeting leader should take a minute to think and make an informed guess based on some key factors: the nature of the meeting’s goals, the people invited to the meeting (discussed in a later chapter), and an analysis of past meetings. The same leader can also, at times, ask others for input and thoughtfully use that feedback, which only serves to engender attendee buy-in to time limits once they have been established. After considering these variables, don’t be wary of scheduling meetings with odd lengths. For example, a forty-eight-minute meeting is just fine if that is the right fit. These odd times attract attention and curiosity and may even be a little fun. (44)
- Once a good time estimate is generated, consider dropping it by 5–10 percent. (44)
- The Yerkes–Dodson law, which maps the relationship between stress and performance, is well established in psychological research. This relationship is one of an inverted U. (44)
- Namely, performance is optimal when some level of stress exists, and performance is lowest in the absence of stress, as well as when there is an abundance of stress. (45)
- Meeting lateness by and large leads to frustration among those who are not late. Most worrisome, this frustration appears to spill over into the meeting itself. (45)
- For example, we observed that when meetings started ten minutes late, besides creating frustration, members were more likely to interrupt one another throughout the meeting. (45)
- Dropping five to ten minutes off the meeting length allows for transition time and helps mitigate future meeting lateness. (45)
- Now when you use the Google Calendar application, you can go into settings and actually change the default meeting length. (46)
- The Super-Speedy Meeting (46)
- A ten- or fifteen-minute meeting is another tool for a leader to consider. (46)
- short meetings are often used to debrief or actively reflect on an event or occurrence like an accident (e.g., what worked and what didn’t work and why). (46)
- Short meetings with a focused agenda, facilitated effectively, can have tremendously positive effects. Plus, these short meetings align with research on limited human attention spans and fatigue. (47)
- the huddle is a gathering of the team to strategize, discuss, monitor, motivate, or celebrate. (47)
- You can also tailor your questions on the basis of emergent priorities and needs. For example, a company I worked with was trying to promote more cross-departmental teamwork. (48)
- It is also important for the meeting leader to stress that the huddle is not about reporting to the leader (this can be emphasized by rotating facilitator responsibilities). (49)
- Instead, the huddle is about the team members communicating with one another, pulling together, learning together, and seeking ways to support each other. (49)
- Relatedly, given the tight time limits of huddles, it is important to recognize that huddles are often about setting the table for additional conversations between team members offline. (49)
- Short Meetings Come with a Few Warnings (50)
- By improving coordination and communication among the members of a team, time is ultimately saved in the form of less rework, more teamwork, more support, and fewer miscommunications that need to be resolved. (50)
- The first hazard is creating yet more time spent in meetings. Shorter meetings are designed to replace some longer meetings. (50)
- A second key hazard to avoid is not honoring the shorter meeting times. (51)
- Our research suggests, in fact, that running late may have more negative consequences on attendees than starting late: it serves to negatively affect any scheduled activities post-meeting, and by ending late, the meeting is breaking an implicit time contract of sorts with attendees. (51)
- To help you get started conducting huddles, a Huddle Implementation Checklist tool is provided at the end of the book. (52)
- The Final Argument for Adding Short Meetings to Your Toolbox (52)
- To no surprise, as people exhale, carbon dioxide readings in confined spaces like meeting rooms increase. (52)
- Granted, they found that these negative effects did not kick in until after two and a half hours, but if you’re looking for a physiological rationale for shorter meetings, it’s there. (52)
- The meeting leader should never be afraid, no matter the length of a meeting, to end a meeting early: (1) when it looks as if the meeting goals have been met (no need to drag it out), or (2) when the attendees seem to be just spinning their wheels and are not being productive. In the case of the latter, sometimes just stopping and regrouping at a later time or using a different communication medium (e.g., email) can be just what is needed to ultimately turn a losing effort into a winning one. (52)
- Unfortunately, relying on a meeting agenda is a quick fix, and not one that on its own will make a difference. (55)
- Taken together, the conclusion is that agendas in and of themselves do little to improve meetings. Furthermore, it is often the case that agendas are recycled from meeting to meeting. (55)
- Planning a Wedding Meeting (56)
- An agenda is an event plan. (56)
- When planning an event, we think carefully about the details, the flow, the experience, and the approach. The same mindset and process should occur when planning a meeting. (56)
- This starts with thinking through what truly needs to be accomplished for the meeting to be successful. (57)
- Meetings should be called to address issues that require genuine interaction among and engagement with attendees. (57)
- If the topic does not require interaction, another communication medium would likely be more efficient (e.g., a memo, webinar). (57)
- Agenda Construction: What Should Be Included in the Meeting? (57)
- ideas for the agenda should also bubble up from the attendees or team members themselves. (58)
- By adding employee input to the meeting agenda, you are increasing the chances of hitting topics of critical importance to all who are present. This all can be executed simply by sending an email three to five days before the meeting asking for topics to include on the agenda (I sometimes recommend having attendees include a reason why this agenda item should be included). (58)
- After identifying the potential topics and goals of the meeting (emerging both from self-reflection and from others’ input), as the meeting leader you need to carefully reflect on the importance of the goals and whether each is adding true value—value beyond opportunity costs (i.e., time that could be spent elsewhere). Drop content that does not make the cut. Also, drop content if the goal is only relevant to a small subset of attendees; in this case, it is best pursued in a different context. (59)
- Agenda Construction: Flow Matters (59)
- To highlight a few key findings, the researchers found that weighty items did not always garner more time; most importantly, the items early in the agenda received a disproportionate amount of time and attention. (59)
- Now that you have this information at hand, you can start making decisions leveraging the following rules of thumb. First, it might be the case in looking at your agenda items that certain items should be addressed in close proximity to one another. By doing so, your agenda will tell a better “story.” Second, if all else is generally equal, I like the idea of prioritizing employee-generated agenda items. This sends a strong message around voice, inclusion, and shared ownership. Third, although meetings should always start on time and all items on the agenda should be important, the very first part of the meeting can contain some “warm-up” types of items, thus serving as a little buffer if individuals are late and, more importantly, as a means to build momentum (e.g., sharing quick announcements, sharing quick updates from the last meeting). (60)
- It is also important to note that no matter what story agenda path you take, it should always end in a similar way—closing with a few-minutes-long wrap-up to cover meeting takeaways, clarify assignments, and note some items that will be put on the agenda for next time. (60)
- I also recommend that you sometimes end the meeting with a Q&A session. (61)
- To Time or Not to Time? (61)
- Sharing Meeting Responsibilities and Assigning Agenda Item Owners (63)
- One way of doing this is to have certain agenda items assigned to “owners.” These owners facilitate the discussion around the agenda item and, in many cases, are in charge of the post-meeting actions related to it. (63)
- The research literature shows that when you clearly and publicly attach a name to a task, you foster accountability. (63)
- Matching a Process with Agenda Item (64)
- planning a meeting is knowing not only what you want to cover but also how you want to go about doing it. (64)
- Consider the people, the tasks, the history, and the potential pitfalls when picking the right tool for the job. (64)
- How far in advance should an agenda be distributed? Generally, two to three days is a fine rule of thumb. (66)
- There is evidence that, as the meeting leader, the early social interactions you encourage and promote have the power to influence the remainder of the meeting. (94)
- First, they found that the types of communication that occurred early predicted the types of communication occurring later for the team (e.g., nonconstructive early conversations seem to persist throughout the meeting). Furthermore, when those early patterns are constructive (e.g., a balanced pattern of interaction), they are ultimately positively consequential to performance. (95)
- What the researchers found was consistent with the flight crew study: early positive comments by the actor were followed by more constructive collective discussions, with increased listening and a higher probability of reaching consensus. (95)
- To start, make your first words to attendees count. Begin the meeting with passion, enthusiasm, vision, and direction. Make it clear why attendees are at the meeting and what needs to get done. (95)
- Next, a meeting leader can consider using no more than one to two minutes to focus on recognition, celebration, and appreciation—ideally, this is directed at a collective accomplishment, but this can also target individual achievements. (96)
- Alternate versions of this approach (again, just a couple of minutes) also exist, such as going around the table and encouraging each attendee: (96)
- To recognize someone (or the broader collective) who has helped them since the last meeting. (96)
- To recognize the achievement or accomplishment of another person since the last meeting. (96)
- However, don’t let this become yet another habit. Try using different prompts occasionally to keep the discussion fresh and interesting. (96)
- I am also a fan of periodically reminding folks about “meeting values” as a means to further create separation and make early moments positively impactful. (96)
- One adaptation of this is to ask attendees at some point what expectations they have of the meeting environment—norms and behaviors they want to see in you as leader and in others. (96)
- Results from a short survey like this can serve as opening fodder. (96)
- Overall, all these various approaches are designed to start the meeting with a better tone than what is typical—a tone where complaints and grousing stay in check. (97)
- Tweaking Meeting Processes to Sustain Presence and Positive Energy (97)
- I want to close the chapter by briefly sharing a variety of additional techniques that, though small in scope, can have positive effects on the meeting and its climate. (97)
- Offer Food (97)
- Not only do people enjoy treats, snacks help build an upbeat mood state and foster camaraderie that can carry into the substance of the meeting itself. (98)
- Bring Toys to the Table (98)
- Some companies use toys and other items, such as Play-Doh, Slinkys, magnets, and other little puzzles and games, to help create separation and concentration and to foster a positive mood state. (98)
- Establish Technology Policies (98)
- An unhealthy paradox ensues; we think we are good at multitasking when we are actually not all that good at it. (99)
- Furthermore, it can serve to distract those around the multitasking individual and lead to feelings of frustration and disrespect. The solution to these problems is an obvious one: create technology-free meeting zones. (99)
- Consider Clicker Quizzes (100)
- The process typically involves attendees visiting a website and entering login credentials. Then, a question is put on the screen for attendees to respond to, and within moments the data are collected and results are presented. This is a terrific way to generate high levels of participation in a very efficient manner. (100)
- Consider Role Playing Beyond Just Devil’s Advocate (101)
- certain individuals can be asked to role play a particular stakeholder not present at the meeting but relevant to the agenda item (e.g., an elderly customer). (101)
- Get Attendees Talking in Pairs (101)
- Before kicking off an all-attendee discussion on an agenda topic, ask folks to get into pairs and talk about the issue at hand for a short amount of time (e.g., three minutes). (101)
- First, it gets everyone involved (e.g., it’s hard to sit back and let other people talk in a one-on-one). Second, it gets a host of new ideas on the table, thus helping to mitigate groupthink. Third, it makes it easy for shy people to engage in the meeting in a way that is comfortable for them; in fact, it is often the case that their “partners” become advocates for their ideas. (102)
- One key to making this process work is to emphasize to the pairs that everything they do in the breakout conversation is just tentative and they are not seeking to come to any resolution (a short time allotment also helps emphasize this reality). (102)
- Consider a Good Old-Fashioned Stretch (102)
- Ten seconds is all you need to boost energy. (102)
- Let me start at the end of the story: sometimes it would be incredibly helpful and productive if meeting attendees would just stop talking for an extended period of time. As crazy as it might sound on the surface, there are a host of techniques that cultivate silence to create dynamic, engaging, and rich meetings. Silence can be golden, especially for generating and evaluating ideas in meetings. In this chapter, we will review the case for silence as a panacea for many meeting ills. (105)
- The Whole Can Be Better Than the Parts (106)
- There is a hope that when you bring people together to work on a challenge or a vexing problem, something unique and synergistic happens, whereby the meeting outcome exceeds what would have been achieved with a series of one-on-one conversations and emails. (106)
- Perhaps most importantly, for good things to happen, the meeting must tap into each attendee’s relevant and critical knowledge, insights, and perspectives. (106)
- Why does the shared information dominate discussion and unique information stay buried? When we present shared knowledge, it is reinforced by others in the form of social approval. (107)
- In fact, one of the key tactics known to prevent groupthink is to make sure contrarian and unique perspectives surface during the course of discussions. (108)
- Three reasons are offered to explain why the non-talking meetings performed better than the talking meetings for brainstorming. (108)
- First, there was an absence of “production blocking.” In a meeting, the general rule of thumb is that only one person can speak at a time (despite the fact that we often talk over each other). (108)
- A second reason is that attendees who silently wrote down their ideas did not fear social humiliation, especially when written contributions were de-identified. (109)
- The third and final reason is that the silent writing meetings fostered a process in which all attendees had to participate—the paper and pen were directly in front of them. Thus, an attendee could not hide behind others’ contributions. (109)
- A Quiet Path Forward: Brainwriting (109)
- Brainwriting represents a series of techniques that strategically use silence to generate ideas and to prioritize ideas. Essentially, brainwriting involves silently sharing written ideas in meetings around a particular topic. (109)
- Simplified Brainwriting with Voting (110)
- Each person in the meeting is asked to neatly respond to a prompt on a piece of paper. (110)
- Once again, only one idea is put on each piece of paper. Each idea is placed in the middle of the conference table, face down. Then, after participants have run out of ideas, they reach into the middle of the table and draw pieces of paper with new ideas listed. Perhaps reading those ideas will inspire new ones, perhaps not. (111)
- The responses are collected by a facilitator (or two, or three, or four) who sorts responses into piles of conceptually similar ideas (this could take place after the idea-generation meeting or during it). (111)
- In the event the group is left with a small number of buckets, the group could choose to discuss and flesh out each bucket in this or future meetings. Alternatively, leaders can use a voting process for whittling down the number of buckets needing to be discussed. (111)
- Brainwriting with a Written Discussion (112)
- What is something you have seen a leader do as part of the agenda that was surprising and well received? (66)
- one leader shares at the end of meetings some fairly specific feedback around something each attendee did during the meeting that she felt was particularly helpful in creating a better experience for all. (66)
- Can you cancel a meeting if you just don’t have compelling agenda topics? Yes, yes, please yes, yes, certainly, a must, and yes. (66)
- Remember: keep your agendas fresh! Refrain from using the same agenda with only a new date. (68)
- Agendas and meetings should not become stale. (68)
- The Case against Big Meetings: A Review of the Evidence (70)
- It is clear that larger meetings bring with them increased coordination challenges; the additional voices and viewpoints over and above the “essential personnel” can become unwieldy to manage and integrate. Perhaps even more noteworthy, we know that as meeting size increases, the probability of the “social disease” called social loafing increases. (70)
- Not only is this good for meeting quality, it is also ultimately good for the employee; our past research shows that when individuals attend meetings not relevant to their job, their employee engagement erodes. (71)
- It Starts with the Goals of the Meeting (72)
- For each meeting goal, the leader should ponder the following questions: 1. Who has the information and knowledge about the topic in question? 2. Who are the key decision makers and important stakeholders relevant to the issue? 3. Who are the people who need the information that is going to be discussed? 4. Who are the people who will implement any decision or act on the issue? (72)
- Meeting Size: Rules of Thumb (72)
- Seven or fewer is the ideal group size for decision-making and problem-solving. Eight to twelve attendees is doable if the leader has outstanding facilitation skills. For idea generation, agenda setting, and huddles, fewer than fifteen individuals is ideal. Overall, a meeting leader wants to have the leanest meeting possible given the goals at hand. (73)
- Smaller Meetings and Hurt Feelings (73)
- Techniques for Reducing Spectators That Don’t Undermine Feelings of Inclusion (74)
- First and foremost, in examining your agenda and the goals listed, it might be the case that you could split the agenda items in a compelling manner, thus allowing you to hold two smaller and shorter meetings rather than one larger, more expansive meeting. This allows you to keep meeting sizes in check. (74)
- The second technique leverages a timed-agenda approach described in the last chapter. With this technique, the meeting boundary becomes porous—certain individuals arrive at certain times and leave at certain times. This is an ideal approach for being highly inclusive but without feeling the weight of too many attendees. (74)
- A spin-off of this approach, which I prefer, is to order the agenda items such that the first items are relevant to the larger group of folks, but then after that item is completed, a group of attendees leaves and the remaining individuals continue on with the meeting. (75)
- Research has demonstrated that asking for input from others, even if none is subsequently provided, engenders feelings of support, buy-in, and an overall feeling of inclusion. (75)
- The third technique involves gathering input from ancillary individuals before the meeting, in lieu of requiring attendance. (75)
- you want them to still feel some sense of voice, you can formally or informally survey these individuals in advance—they can provide input on a series of prompts that will be discussed in the meeting itself. This could include their ideas about topics, reactions to a topic, or other ideas for topics that should be discussed in the larger meeting. (75)
- Detailed meeting notes are often taken (1) to help attendees remember what was actually said during the meeting, (2) to help attendees recognize that what they said was actually heard as it was documented, and, most importantly, (3) to promote post-meeting actions being taken by directly responsible individuals as recorded in the meeting. These notes, however, can also be used to promote feelings of inclusion among those not attending meetings. (76)
- The meeting notes can be provided to them with an email that invites questions, comments, and other remarks that can inform the next meeting. (77)
- The bottom line is, by inviting input, by sharing meeting notes, and by keeping future invitations on the table, you mitigate others’ feelings of isolation. Feelings of gratitude around having additional time, however, are amplified. (77)
- The fifth and final technique for decreasing meeting size is called “representative voices.” In this approach the meeting leader asks certain individuals to explicitly represent a set of stakeholders; this becomes an additional meeting role the individual takes on. (78)
- In this role, the representative is expected to connect with folks in that function before the meeting, keep them in the loop afterward, and ask for input as needed on an ongoing basis. (78)
- Explicitly, being assigned a direct role resulted in more commitment to action. (78)
- In this chapter, I will discuss minor interventions to break meeting rhythms to create new energy and new dynamics and raise attendee enthusiasm. (81)
- What I am advocating is that meeting leaders be sensitive to rituals becoming ruts, leading to stagnation. (82)
- The Chair Has More Power Than You Think (82)
- The dynamics created by seating location do not necessarily derail a meeting. But seating can affect meeting effectiveness, critical decision-making, creativity, enjoyment, and energy. (82)
- The takeaway from this seating analysis is not that the meeting leader needs to have a heavy hand in socially engineering the meeting experience, but that having some fluidity in seating is useful so that, over time, a full range of dynamics is experienced in the meeting. (83)
- A Walking Meeting (85)
- Taken together, it appears that walking is not only good for the individual’s mind and body but also results in greater potential for innovative thinking. (86)
- Most importantly, walking meetings are really only effective for small gatherings. Two or three attendees is ideal. Four attendees can work with excellent facilitation. (87)
- The agenda must be such that technology tools are not needed. That said, I recommended to one leader that he make voice-to-text memos using his phone, to capture key takeaways during the walk—this is fast and easy. (87)
- A Standing Meeting (88)
- Although meeting quality was unaffected by meeting format, sit-down meetings took 34 percent longer than standing meetings—so, same quality in considerably less time (88)
- Attendees also reported greater satisfaction with the standing meetings. (89)
- Trying new things conveys to your team that you care and that you value controlled risk-taking and experimentation. (90)
- In this chapter I will discuss how bringing positive energy into your meetings will benefit individuals and teams. (91)
- Why Positivity? (91)
- Positive mood states promote individual cognitive flexibility, resilience, well-being, and even creativity. Interestingly, and of great relevance to this chapter, the collective mood states of the meeting attendees, taken together, also matter. (91)
- In meetings with more humor and laughter patterns (more than would be observed due to chance), there was a greater propensity for socioemotional communication (e.g., support), constructive conversations, and novel solutions. (92)
- Unfortunately, I know it may be hard to believe, but attending a meeting does not appear to put people in a good mood. In my early research, I found that meetings are often experienced as a work interruption. (92)
- Stated differently, to achieve presence and, in turn, positivity, you must start by creating separation from the strain associated with the interruption. (93)
- Creating Separation (93)
- Even before the meeting gets underway, the leader should actively greet attendees and help folks feel welcome, appreciated, and needed. (93)
- If some attendees don’t know each other, be active in making introductions and even pointing out common areas of interest. (93)
- Above all else, be a source of positive energy. (94)
- As an alternative to greeting attendees as just described, I sometimes use music to foster separation and build presence. (94)
- Brainwriting with a written discussion takes the techniques just discussed up a notch by fostering a highly inclusive discussion, but doing so entirely in writing. (112)
- Each idea or concept goes on pieces of poster paper, which are then taped to the wall or to various tables in the room. (112)
- Attendees, armed with pens, roam around the room where the ideas are posted, adding comments or thoughts or things to think about for each idea listed. (112)
- Participants can also add comments or thoughts in response to a written comment. (112)
- Continuing Down the Quiet Path: Silent Reading (114)
- Yes, simply reading silently is used as a technique to promote meeting effectiveness. It is particularly well suited for agendas involving a proposal of an idea, concept, or initiative. (114)
- Bezos wanted ideas to be evaluated on their merits and not influenced by the flash, personality, and speaking talents of the presenter. Nor did he want the implicit pressure to be socially cohesive to dictate the choices attendees made in meetings. (114)
- Writing in advance of the meeting requires the presenter to think deeply and cogently about what he or she is proposing before engaging extensively with others and using their time. (115)
- After the silent reading period is complete, a vigorous discussion typically occurs. (115)
- The bottom line is that reading the document relative to a presentation allows for much more extensive content, with more retention at an efficient pace. This in turn triggers deep dives, debates, and valuable discourse. It is common practice for the most senior manager to hold comments until hearing others’ ideas so as not to sway the discussion prematurely. (116)
- Putting It Together (116)
- I am not referring to video-based calling in—I mean the omnipresent practice of phoning in. (119)
- Remote Meetings Are Primed for Failure (119)
- There is strong evidence to suggest that the more anonymous individuals are, the more likely they are to social loaf. The luxury of not being seen is the perfect environment for anonymity. (120)
- Assuming each attendee invited to the meeting was truly needed, the lack of complete engagement by remote attendees is clearly counterproductive to the meeting. (120)
- Facilitating a Messy Audio Situation (121)
- Pre-Meeting Tips (121)
- Consider “banning” the mute button. (121)
- When someone is on mute, multitasking becomes almost a foregone conclusion. (121)
- During-Meeting Tips (122)
- Ask attendees for permission to serve as the meeting “taskmaster,” which entails being firm about keeping the conversation on track and calling on different people when appropriate. (122)
- Use people’s names as much as possible throughout the discussion. Actively manage conversation flow. Draw remote attendees in (e.g., “Sasha, share your thoughts”). (122)
- During the meeting, try to direct questions and comments to specific individuals. (122)
- Have Instant Messenger or related technology in place, not for folks to engage in side conversations but for attendees to notify you during the meeting if they want to speak or to indicate, for example, if you missed something. (122)
- Post-Meeting Tips (123)
- Ask attendees periodically for suggestions on how to improve the meeting (things to stop, start, or continue doing). (123)
- Look for future opportunities for attendee face time with one another as a way to build trust, foster connections, promote empathy, learn about others, and understand humor styles. (123)
- Use Subteams (124)
- What she does not use the meetings for is decision-making, problem-solving, or any substantive activity involving discussion. (124)
- These subteams discuss the problem at hand, generate potential ideas, and draft preliminary solutions. They also decide on a representative to represent the subteam. The subteam is small enough that all are able to be engaged (subteams often rotate membership over time). (124)
- Later, the representatives of the various subteams, along with Sandy, meet to discuss the problem and come to a decision, which is then explained to all the others. (124)
- Use Intervals (124)
- The meeting is just fifteen minutes long. Then, post-meeting, using a basic Google Docs type of technology that allows for shared input, folks asynchronously brainstorm ideas and approaches to the problem. After a set number of days, the brainstorming ends. (124)
- Sandy assigns a representative from the team to clean up and condense the document, which is then used for the next phase—prioritizing. (125)
- Team members are asked via email to go back and vote on the five ideas they think are the most promising solutions (125)
- A twenty-minute remote call meeting is then set up (this is not hard to do since her team blocks off two hours a week for activities such as this). In this meeting, Sandy shares the top vote getters and leads a facilitated conversation in which folks talk about the finalist options on the table and ask questions. (125)
- The next day, team members are asked to vote for what they consider the best solution, using an online survey (e.g., Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey). Sandy announces the path going forward and asks three individuals to lead implementation. These three individuals are given latitude to tweak the solution as warranted given any emergent issues. (125)
- As a related aside, there are data suggesting that breaking a meeting into two or more smaller parts results in higher-quality outcomes. (126)
- The researchers suggested that breaking a meeting into parts helps counteract a natural tendency in meetings to seek premature consensus. (126)
- Namely, attendees often rally around the first reasonable solution and ideas generated, often stopping genuine and critical deliberations too early. (126)
- often having one meeting to discuss alternatives and another meeting to make the decision. These companies have found that by separating discussion and decisions, they can yield higher-quality outcomes. (126)
- Instead of actively working to mitigate the direct costs and indirect costs (e.g., frustration, opportunity costs), we accept bad meetings as a way of life. (129)
- Without meetings, it is hard to imagine an organization thriving, innovating, and being agile and resilient over the long term. (129)
- Successful organizations, and successful leaders, understand that small, positive changes—say, one meeting every week—can lead to palpable gains for the organization and the health, motivation, and engagement of its employees. (129)
- Visualization and Anticipation (130)
- As a meeting leader, if you simply take a bit of time to think through—to visualize—the meeting, the flow, the key needs, and the key challenges in advance, you will improve the chances of ultimate success. (130)
- Alternatively, you can more actively engage in the anticipation process by engaging in what is called a “premortem” (aka prospective hindsight) prior to the meeting. In this approach, the leader imagines that the meeting has failed and then works backward to ascertain potential explanations for the failure. (130)
- Preparation (130)
- There are a host of decisions that need to be made, and made well, prior to the start of the meeting. These decisions should be purposely made, rather than decided out of habit and tradition. They concern meeting time, agenda, attendees, and the context for the meeting. (130)
- good tip for making an agenda that is meeting specific—and will also increase accountability—is to ask attendees for items to include on the agenda. (131)
- There is evidence that, as the meeting leader, the early social interactions you encourage and promote have the power to influence the remainder of the meeting. (94)
- First, they found that the types of communication that occurred early predicted the types of communication occurring later for the team (e.g., nonconstructive early conversations seem to persist throughout the meeting). Furthermore, when those early patterns are constructive (e.g., a balanced pattern of interaction), they are ultimately positively consequential to performance. (95)
- What the researchers found was consistent with the flight crew study: early positive comments by the actor were followed by more constructive collective discussions, with increased listening and a higher probability of reaching consensus. (95)
- To start, make your first words to attendees count. Begin the meeting with passion, enthusiasm, vision, and direction. Make it clear why attendees are at the meeting and what needs to get done. (95)
- Next, a meeting leader can consider using no more than one to two minutes to focus on recognition, celebration, and appreciation—ideally, this is directed at a collective accomplishment, but this can also target individual achievements. (96)
- Alternate versions of this approach (again, just a couple of minutes) also exist, such as going around the table and encouraging each attendee: (96)
- To recognize someone (or the broader collective) who has helped them since the last meeting. (96)
- To recognize the achievement or accomplishment of another person since the last meeting. (96)
- However, don’t let this become yet another habit. Try using different prompts occasionally to keep the discussion fresh and interesting. (96)
- I am also a fan of periodically reminding folks about “meeting values” as a means to further create separation and make early moments positively impactful. (96)
- One adaptation of this is to ask attendees at some point what expectations they have of the meeting environment—norms and behaviors they want to see in you as leader and in others. (96)
- Results from a short survey like this can serve as opening fodder. (96)
- Overall, all these various approaches are designed to start the meeting with a better tone than what is typical—a tone where complaints and grousing stay in check. (97)
- Tweaking Meeting Processes to Sustain Presence and Positive Energy (97)
- I want to close the chapter by briefly sharing a variety of additional techniques that, though small in scope, can have positive effects on the meeting and its climate. (97)
- Offer Food (97)
- Not only do people enjoy treats, snacks help build an upbeat mood state and foster camaraderie that can carry into the substance of the meeting itself. (98)
- Bring Toys to the Table (98)
- Some companies use toys and other items, such as Play-Doh, Slinkys, magnets, and other little puzzles and games, to help create separation and concentration and to foster a positive mood state. (98)
- Establish Technology Policies (98)
- An unhealthy paradox ensues; we think we are good at multitasking when we are actually not all that good at it. (99)
- Furthermore, it can serve to distract those around the multitasking individual and lead to feelings of frustration and disrespect. The solution to these problems is an obvious one: create technology-free meeting zones. (99)
- Consider Clicker Quizzes (100)
- The process typically involves attendees visiting a website and entering login credentials. Then, a question is put on the screen for attendees to respond to, and within moments the data are collected and results are presented. This is a terrific way to generate high levels of participation in a very efficient manner. (100)
- Consider Role Playing Beyond Just Devil’s Advocate (101)
- certain individuals can be asked to role play a particular stakeholder not present at the meeting but relevant to the agenda item (e.g., an elderly customer). (101)
- Get Attendees Talking in Pairs (101)
- Before kicking off an all-attendee discussion on an agenda topic, ask folks to get into pairs and talk about the issue at hand for a short amount of time (e.g., three minutes). (101)
- First, it gets everyone involved (e.g., it’s hard to sit back and let other people talk in a one-on-one). Second, it gets a host of new ideas on the table, thus helping to mitigate groupthink. Third, it makes it easy for shy people to engage in the meeting in a way that is comfortable for them; in fact, it is often the case that their “partners” become advocates for their ideas. (102)
- One key to making this process work is to emphasize to the pairs that everything they do in the breakout conversation is just tentative and they are not seeking to come to any resolution (a short time allotment also helps emphasize this reality). (102)
- Consider a Good Old-Fashioned Stretch (102)
- Ten seconds is all you need to boost energy. (102)
- Let me start at the end of the story: sometimes it would be incredibly helpful and productive if meeting attendees would just stop talking for an extended period of time. As crazy as it might sound on the surface, there are a host of techniques that cultivate silence to create dynamic, engaging, and rich meetings. Silence can be golden, especially for generating and evaluating ideas in meetings. In this chapter, we will review the case for silence as a panacea for many meeting ills. (105)
- The Whole Can Be Better Than the Parts (106)
- There is a hope that when you bring people together to work on a challenge or a vexing problem, something unique and synergistic happens, whereby the meeting outcome exceeds what would have been achieved with a series of one-on-one conversations and emails. (106)
- Perhaps most importantly, for good things to happen, the meeting must tap into each attendee’s relevant and critical knowledge, insights, and perspectives. (106)
- Why does the shared information dominate discussion and unique information stay buried? When we present shared knowledge, it is reinforced by others in the form of social approval. (107)
- In fact, one of the key tactics known to prevent groupthink is to make sure contrarian and unique perspectives surface during the course of discussions. (108)
- Three reasons are offered to explain why the non-talking meetings performed better than the talking meetings for brainstorming. (108)
- First, there was an absence of “production blocking.” In a meeting, the general rule of thumb is that only one person can speak at a time (despite the fact that we often talk over each other). (108)
- A second reason is that attendees who silently wrote down their ideas did not fear social humiliation, especially when written contributions were de-identified. (109)
- The third and final reason is that the silent writing meetings fostered a process in which all attendees had to participate—the paper and pen were directly in front of them. Thus, an attendee could not hide behind others’ contributions. (109)
- A Quiet Path Forward: Brainwriting (109)
- Brainwriting represents a series of techniques that strategically use silence to generate ideas and to prioritize ideas. Essentially, brainwriting involves silently sharing written ideas in meetings around a particular topic. (109)
- Simplified Brainwriting with Voting (110)
- Each person in the meeting is asked to neatly respond to a prompt on a piece of paper. (110)
- Once again, only one idea is put on each piece of paper. Each idea is placed in the middle of the conference table, face down. Then, after participants have run out of ideas, they reach into the middle of the table and draw pieces of paper with new ideas listed. Perhaps reading those ideas will inspire new ones, perhaps not. (111)
- The responses are collected by a facilitator (or two, or three, or four) who sorts responses into piles of conceptually similar ideas (this could take place after the idea-generation meeting or during it). (111)
- In the event the group is left with a small number of buckets, the group could choose to discuss and flesh out each bucket in this or future meetings. Alternatively, leaders can use a voting process for whittling down the number of buckets needing to be discussed. (111)
- Brainwriting with a Written Discussion (112)
- To solve this problem, determine how many people are needed, then provide nonessential personnel the opportunity to be involved in a more appropriate way. (132)
- Meeting Mindset (134)
- The leader’s meeting mindset is a key predictor of meeting success. In Chapter 3, I explained the concept of a giver or servant leader; this mindset drives how the meeting leader facilitates the meeting. If you adopt this mindset, you will plan and lead your meetings with the understanding that it is your duty to make the meeting a good use of time and value for all. (134)
- The leader manages crucial meeting dynamics: engaging all attendees, asking the right questions, modeling active listening, drawing out input, playing traffic officer, and managing emergent conflict. (134)
- Active Facilitation (134)
- Because meetings can be experienced as an interruption, meeting leaders should work to promote positivity the moment attendees enter the room. (134)
- Offer a purposeful opening statement, consider some of the prompts I provided in Chapter 8 (e.g., recognizing group accomplishments), and remind attendees of the “meeting values.” (135)
- To encourage mindfulness (i.e., presence) once the meeting is underway, discourage multitasking during the meeting. (135)
- To sustain the momentum from these recommendations and to keep things fresh and engaging, it is important to facilitate meetings with variety. (135)
- If you’d like to move beyond more conventional techniques, try incorporating silence into meetings. (135)
- Brainwriting involves silently writing ideas about a particular topic before sharing the ideas with others in the meeting. (135)
- The second technique that builds on silence within meetings is silent reading. (136)
- Silent reading can increase employees’ understanding and retention of the new idea and it can also save time by cutting out the presentation and decreasing pre-meeting preparation. (136)
- Further, be comfortable in fully embracing your role as an active “taskmaster,” drawing attendees in by name, asking questions of particular individuals, and considering banning the mute button to reduce multitasking. (136)
- Reflection (136)
- Putting this informal scanning of cues aside, the best practice for leaders is to periodically evaluate their regular meetings. (137)
- The Bottom Line (137)
- First, meetings allow individual attendees to interpersonally connect with one another, which serves to build relationships, networks, and, most important, support. (137)
- Second, meetings can be an ideal venue to bring together ideas, thoughts, and opinions—things that should help each person perform his or her job in a better, more coordinated and cooperative manner. (137)
- Third, meetings enable leaders and employees alike to create a shared understanding that promotes efficiency and teamwork. (137)
- Fourth, meetings build commitment to goals, initiatives, and broader aspirations that may not be explicitly stated in any individual job description. Employees can see they are part of something bigger than themselves. (137)
- Finally, meetings bring individuals together as a coherent whole. As a result, this coherent whole can be more adaptive, resilient, and self-directing, especially in the face of crises. (138)
- Try, reflect, and learn. Not only will you see a direct improvement in your meetings, but the process will communicate to those around you that you are willing to experiment, to take reasonable risks, and to grow. (138)
- Offer appreciation. Begin by expressing appreciation for the attendees’ work and contributions. (142)
- Lead meetings with questions. Develop an agenda that consists of questions, rather than statements. (146)
- Provide adequate training. Provide skills training to both those in and those not in leadership roles. Consider the use of simulations, such as those available in some academic programs and online, as an opportunity to train in a more active way. (146)

- Team members are asked via email to go back and vote on the five ideas they think are the most promising solutions (125)
- A twenty-minute remote call meeting is then set up (this is not hard to do since her team blocks off two hours a week for activities such as this). In this meeting, Sandy shares the top vote getters and leads a facilitated conversation in which folks talk about the finalist options on the table and ask questions. (125)
- The next day, team members are asked to vote for what they consider the best solution, using an online survey (e.g., Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey). Sandy announces the path going forward and asks three individuals to lead implementation. These three individuals are given latitude to tweak the solution as warranted given any emergent issues.

- As a related aside, there are data suggesting that breaking a meeting into two or more smaller parts results in higher-quality outcomes. (126)
- The researchers suggested that breaking a meeting into parts helps counteract a natural tendency in meetings to seek premature consensus. (126)
- Namely, attendees often rally around the first reasonable solution and ideas generated, often stopping genuine and critical deliberations too early. (126)
- often having one meeting to discuss alternatives and another meeting to make the decision. These companies have found that by separating discussion and decisions, they can yield higher-quality outcomes. (126)
- Instead of actively working to mitigate the direct costs and indirect costs (e.g., frustration, opportunity costs), we accept bad meetings as a way of life. (129)
- Without meetings, it is hard to imagine an organization thriving, innovating, and being agile and resilient over the long term. (129)
- Successful organizations, and successful leaders, understand that small, positive changes—say, one meeting every week—can lead to palpable gains for the organization and the health, motivation, and engagement of its employees. (129)
- Visualization and Anticipation (130)
- As a meeting leader, if you simply take a bit of time to think through—to visualize—the meeting, the flow, the key needs, and the key challenges in advance, you will improve the chances of ultimate success. (130)
- Alternatively, you can more actively engage in the anticipation process by engaging in what is called a “premortem” (aka prospective hindsight) prior to the meeting. In this approach, the leader imagines that the meeting has failed and then works backward to ascertain potential explanations for the failure. (130)
- Preparation (130)
- There are a host of decisions that need to be made, and made well, prior to the start of the meeting. These decisions should be purposely made, rather than decided out of habit and tradition. They concern meeting time, agenda, attendees, and the context for the meeting. (130)
- good tip for making an agenda that is meeting specific—and will also increase accountability—is to ask attendees for items to include on the agenda. (131)
