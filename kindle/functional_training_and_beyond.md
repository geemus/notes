# Functional Training and Beyond: Building the Ultimate Superfunctional Body and Mind

* SAID - Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands
* A(k)TSP(g) (or Ability Tree) - physical Attributes, knowledge, Traits, Skills, technique Proficiencies, and goals. Left is more foundational, and well set you up for further right.
* Central concept is progressive overload, by increasing acceleration, resistence, duration, etc. As far as motor unit recruitment goes, lifting 50-70% of 1RM as fast as possible is like lifting 80-90% at regular speed. Focusing on acceleration is sometimes referred to as the dynamic effort method.
* Lifting at 90% of 1RM may be optimal for max and explosive starting strength, but this requires a lot of recovery and increases injury risk. So many recommend sticking to around 75-85% of 1RM most of the time.
* Change your relationship with your environment by maintaining an intent to train and explore your movement.

* Workouts
  * Start with the traits that appeal to you and your goals, then create blocks of related exercise to use on their own or combine into longer workouts. As long as the overall weekly valume is optimal, the particular clustering doesn't matter.
  * Focus on moves that give the most "bang for our buck", utilizing the strengths of moves from across many disciplines.
  * Start with the lower volumes of complex/demanding moves like multi-joint, multi-planar or extremely heavy movements. Finish with higher volumes of simpler moves like closed-chain, light or isolated movements.
  * Mechanical dropsets allow more endurance work by altering mechanics after failure is reached. ie push-ups to fail, then knee push-ups, etc.
  * If building endurance is a priority, consider metcon circuits.
* Intensity
  * Polarized Training uses roughly 75% low intensity, 20% high intensity, and about 5% threshold training.
  * Low Instensity Steady State cardio or LISS, involves activity at around 70 percent of the maximum heart rate or below.
    * strengthens the heart and develops Qmax (quantified maximal cardiac output) by allowing the heart to fully relax between beats. Building a stronger heart also leads to a lower resting heart rate as each beat is more effective.
  * High Intensity Interval Training or HIIT
    * excellent for fat loss because it depletes available energy in muscles and bloodstream.
    * shorter timeframe
    * increases density of mitochondria, allowing more efficient energy production
  * Both LISS and HIIT improve V02 max
* Cycles
  * Total volume of weekly/monthly training may be the most important factor for hypertrophy. Once a week is likely suboptimal.
  * Minimum volume is 2-5 sets to failure per muscle group per week, optimal is 9-18 sets and varies by muscle group.
  * A set of workouts combine to create a microcycle. Microcycles combined with deloads (roughly once per 6 weeks) to create a macrocycle.
  * Deload weeks can focus on mental training and/or mobility.
  * Splits
    * Some splits/programs: PPL (push-pull-legs), StrongLifts 5x5.
    * You can target one muscle group, the entire body with less intensity but with greater frequency, or separate push/pull/leg and use PPL approach.
    * Author prefers full-body with a focus. Many moves are inherently compound and multi-planar, so focusing could be limiting.

* Hypertrophy
  * Three main stimuli for signaling hypertrophy: mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress.
    * When muscle contracts strongly, growth factors such as myokines are released.
    * Damage occurs due to microtrauma, which the body often repairs by adding density to compensate and prevent further damage. The greatest amount of damage occurs during the lengthening (eccentric) phase of exercises.
    * Contracting muscles has an occlusion effect, essentially trapping blood and allowing it to pool. This bathes muscles in growth factors, which increases growth via swelling (and possibly other mechanisms).
    * Metabolic stress seems to be increased most in the shortening (concentric) phase of exercise. It is accomplished via higher repititions, leading to greater build-up of blood and metabolites.
  * Myofibrillar hypertrophy is the increase in myofibril volume, whereas sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is "muscle swelling", where muscles appear larger without being stronger, but this may still increase strength endurance by providing a greater supply of energy.
  * Training (catabolism) provides stimulus, but recovery (anabolism) is when growth happens.
* Energy Systems
  * Three body energy systems: ATP creatine system (aka phosphocreatine system), Glycogen Lactic Acid System (aka Lactic Acid System, aka Glycolytic System), and Aerobic System
  * Energy systems are not mutually exclusive, your body is constantly using a combination for power.
  * Anaerobic threshold is where the switch happens from primarily aerobic to primarily anaerobic, and is directly linked to the number and efficiency of mitochondria.
  * Anaerobic threshold is roughly the point at which talking becomes very difficult (can be specifically determined through a grueling test).
  * "Lactate threshold" or "lactate inflection point" is the point at which lactate build-up outpaces the body's ability to take it away, and is distinct from anaerobic threshold.
  * Training at yoru anaerobic threshold increases your ability to generate energy efficiently, and also to deal with fatigue-inducing metabolites.

* To work more on endurance, instead of increasing resistence, increase the number of reps as things get easier.
* Metabolic conditioning switches between a host of movements while trying to sustain max output for thirty seconds at a time. This provides a way to combine endurance training with movements that provide other benefits. For example combining kettlebell swings, lizard crawls, and offset loaded carries also develops core stability, hip hinge, grip strength, mobility, etc.
* Metabolic conditioning (metcon) circuits can also be designed to challenge the heart even more via "shunting" by switching between upper and lower body movements to force the body to drive blood up and then down the body.

* Intensity techniques include: drop sets, burns, flush sets, negatives, supersets, assisted reps, partial reps, cheats, and pre-exhaust.
* Resistance bands or chains can also be used to adjust resistance at different points.
* Addressing plateaus:
  * spend longer at a set weight (even when it is easy), but take a bigger jump once ready
  * take time to address weaknesses and issues in form

* conciously controlling muscle - activating muscles at will (and ideally relaxing antagonist muscles as well)
* isometric contractions (contractions that don't result in movement). Increase neural drive, or the ability to activite muscles fiber in a given muscle.
  * yielding isometrics are based on holding a joint in place against resistance
  * overcoming isometrics are based on pushing or pulling an immovable force. Can be like trying to lift 110% of 1RM, but only works in about 30 degrees of joint angle, so needs repeated for full effect.
  * quasi-isometrics involve moving extremely slowly through the full range of motion in an exercise. Removes ability to rely on momentum, teaches perfect technique, and allows for practicing controlled, shallow breathing, with a tight core.
  * "passive quasi-isometrics" focus on keeping as much of your body relaxed as possible, while exerting only the force necessary in specific muscle groups to continue the movement. This is opposed to active quasi-isometrics in which the entire body should be contracted to maintain tension

* "seven primal movements" from physiologist Paul Check: push, pull, squat, lunge, bend, twist, gait.

* kettlebell flows and hybrid exercises get us outside constrained, repetitive movement patterns. But we should take care not to train with heavier weights past the point where form breaks down.
* tire flipping has the unique benefit of being concentric only (limiting muscle damage, while still providing mechanical tension and metabolic stress). Can also do "push overs" to a wall or partner, front squats, and leg presses.
* sandbags
* medicine balls
* Unstable Surface Training or UST - stability balls and balance balls
* Proprioception training
  * proprioceptors include: muscle spindles (stretch receptors detect when muscles change length), golgi tendon organs (detect alterations in muscle tension), pacinian corpuscles (located in skin, detect pressure changes)
* neck training - can improve balance. Can use isometrics or harness. Include flexion, lateral flexion, extension, protrusion, retraction, and rotation.
* bands, ropes, chairs - alter strength curve or angle of resistance
* serape effect - moves that require rotating the trunk, stretching multiple muscles across the torso to exert maximum force
* "it's not the tool that makes a movement worthwhile, but the intent and the focus"
* recognize benefits of each form of training and use them for the right reasons, recognize gaps and borrow from other areas to fill them
* calisthenics allow you to train more vulnerable positions and more complex movement patterns, but with limited resistance. Can increase difficulty via: perform extremely high-rep ranges, switch to unilateral (one-sided) movements, extend the lever arm, aind train explosively.
  * two-finger push-up, a perfect unilateral movement
  * anti-extension movements - dragon flag, LaLanne push-up (push-up with arms outstretched overhead and only fingers touching floor), ab rollouts, hollow body
  * freestanding handstand - develop proprioception (can challenge by closing your eyes)
  * planche - masterclass in fitness and physiology, requires caution, patience, proprioception, and understanding of biomechanics
  * pistol squat, v-sit, front lever, human flag
* plyometrics - explosive movement utilizing stretch-shortening cycle ("store" elastic energy when lengthening muscles" and engaging more fast-twitch muscle fiber. The less time between lengthening and shortening, the more power is translated to the final move. Examples: clapping push ups, clapping pull ups, squat jumps. Can go a step further with "shock training" such as depth jumps (dropping from a short height, landing, and springing back), this appears to engage myotatic reflex (forcefully shoretening muscles that suddenly stretch).
  * to explode with maximum force, plyometrics need more time for recovery between sets, usually 3-5x the length of the sets themselves
* You can train the transverse abdominis via ab-vacuums.
* locomotion - provides physical mastery, but not progressive overload. Encourages intuition and creativity to move between movements.
  * Animal Flow - ape, beast, crab
  * GMB - Elements- bear, frogger, monkey
  * Vahva - Movement 202x - many moves including lizard crawl, duck walk, and gorilla leap.
  * MovNat - spear throwing and climbing trees
  * quadrepedal movements - balances weight across limbs and aligns core, trains contralateral movement.
  * free running
  * limitations - less suited to building max strength, often limited to groud movements but can include climbing, hanging, swinging (brachiation), upright bipedal movement, object manipulation, and even swimming.
* barefoot and toe training
* consider lifting/climbing/locomoting in natural places and with natural objects to provide variety
* cold exposure releases testosterone, raises metabolism, enhances thermoregulation, and provides "discomfort training"
* "mammalian diving response" dousing the face with cold water lowers heart rate by 10-25 percent and increases blood flow to vital organs.
* MovNat - physical competency based on locomotive skills of walking, running, balancing, crawling, jumping, climbing and swimming; and manipulative skills of lifting, carrying, throwing and catching, and the defensive skills of striking and grappling. Most important principles are practicality and adaptability.
* Lungs can be specifically trained by breathing through a straw or using inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Training masks offer similar effects.

* Slowcomotion - Strength at Every Angle - Slow and Mechanically DisAdvantaged Movement SAMDAM
  * Roughly four categories: Ground, Bipedal, Climbing, and Manipulation
  * By moving slowly through complex movements and at difficult angles you train weak points and learn to move powerfully from any position.
  * Manipulation uses an external submaximal load, moved in graceful, controlled patterns while standing, squatting, or even sitting.
  * Can mix in explosive plyometrics (from stronger more stable positions) to break up the slow cadence or even overcoming isometrics.
  * Overcoming Gravity Isometrics - move to a position where you can't lift your body. ie one-handed pseudo planche push-up, or attempt to "squeeze" the ground like a pec fly.
  * Helps train angles and positions many movements can't to round things out.

* Natural human mobility - your freedom of movement (positions your can reach through your own strength and control). Gain comfort by training in different positions. May be best to reach positions as part of more complex movement patterns. Try to focus on stretches that don't incorporate external resistence.
* passive stretching can be used while working or reading, ie the resting squat
* see also: PNF stretching
* avoid stretching prior to strength training as it increases the likelihood of injury
* training fascia - lots of nerves, may serve communication purposes across body
* embodied cognition suggests that many aspects of cognition are grounded in physical experience.
* complex and varied movements provide cognitive stimulation and benefits.

* fine motor control - cursive, playing piano, coloring, sewing, etc
* ambidexterity training - try cursive with non-dominant hand, possibly while also journaling or similar

* visualization - vision streaming, close your ideas and let your imagination flow, then describe what you see continually as it changes. Or practice mental rotation of objects.
* productive meditation - spending a set period to try and solve a specific problem
* big idea meditation - spending a set period of time thinking about something that is huge, creative, or even potentially impossible to fathom
* working memory - dual n-back training
* neuroplasticity - neurons that fire together wire together
* process of motor learning (postulated by P Fitts & M. Posner in 1967) suggests three disctinct phases: cognitive, associative, and autonomous
  * things require a lot of effort initially, but become second nature
  * being mindful of our practice will help skill growth
  * immediate feedback is helpful when learning new skills
  * practicing over and over, what Pavel Tsatsouline calls "greasing the groove" helps refine neural pathways allowing for more efficiency and recruiting optimal motor units. So instead of as many reps as you can in a short time, you could do just a few reps over and over throughout the day to accumulate lots of reps with little muscle damage.
* visualization can also be utilized to help with learning motor skills
* spaced learning revisits things once they have left working memory to reenforce
* physical intelligence - benefits our health as we age, may help us recognize why we feel the way we do.
* important to focus on having as much anabolism/recovery as possible and mitigating stress
* cognitive restructuring and metacognition (from CBT) help by installing coping mechanisms.
  * thought challenging - assess the reality of the situation
  * hypothesis testing - face your fears intentionally to see that things aren't as bad as imagined
* breathing and meditation
  * fourfold breath - inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, etc
  * wim hof
* changing breathing can change your mindset
* gazing meditation
* directive meditation seeks to focus or clear the mind
* practicing mental math can help with emotional control and even combat depression
* nondirective meditation seeks to relax the mind and allow thoughts to come and go, which can help organize thoughts and memories
* flow - between stress and calm. challenge is just right, task is rewarding.
  * owl eyes or splatter vision: become aware of peripheral vision. Helps us stay calmer and be present. Can also be practiced via hakalau meditation.
* mental challenge - break challenges into digestible chunks, practice nonreactivity. Train/practice doing things you don't want to do.

* Missing Attributes
  * Lateral rotation of shoulders, such as through face pulls (which don't provide that many other benefits, but few other things help with this area)
  * Thoracic spine mobility, particularly back bends. Can be addressed with back bridges, ponte, and/or Hindu squats.
  * straight arm strength. Can be addressed with planch progressions and levers.
  * calf strength. can be addressed calf jumps (jump while keeping knees and hips entirely straight)
  * finger strength. can be addressed through LaLanne and other finger push-ups
  * neck training

* nootropics - somewhat dubious, what even is optimal? That being said, there are some things that are more common and helpful.
* omega 3 for brain health
* lutein + zeaxanthin - raising energy levels by increasing efficiency of mitochondria, increase visual processing speeds, and increases plasticity in infant brains. Also positive effects for spatial memory, reasoning, and more.
* creatine - boost strength endurance and cognitive performance
* seek a varied and nutritious diet
