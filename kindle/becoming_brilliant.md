# Becoming Brilliant: What Science Tells Us About Raising Successful Children

* The real issue confronting us is sorting through, prioritizing and making use of all the information coming at us.
* Society thrives when we craft environments that support kids to become better citizens.
* We should seek to learn alongside children, working together to construct knowledge.

## Balancing Hard and Soft Skills

* The 6Cs: collaboration, communication, content, critical thinking, creative innovation, and confidence.

1. Model born from science of learning.
2. Malleable skills to continually grow in, not traits to check off a list.
3. Focus on the learner, not teacher/parent/etc.
4. Skills adaptable to many contexts.

## Collaboration

1. On My Own - Collaboration starts with self-regulation to not become hysterical any time something goes wrong. Scaffold by offering children ways to express feelings they might not think of on their own, comforting them and/or distracting them (until they learn to do these things themselves). In organizational contexts, this may be more like management coaches scaffolding independent units to be team players.
2. Side by Side - No planning, just momentary joining to get a job done (sometimes called parallel play). If we expect collaboration and social contral, we often get it.
3. Back and Forth - Pursuing loosely defined common interests, more interest in one another than toys (sometimes called associative play). Scaffold by inviting children to join in projects and look for ways to teach that more prizes come from helping than going it alone. Organizationally, it's important to start by defining the goals of collaboration, and understanding who should collaborate (as collaboration often thrives on differences in opinion, rather than similarities).
4. Building it Together - Pairs have a clear goal, trust one another, input from each is valued, and there is a join responsibility for the result (sometimes called collaborative play). In this mode children plan together, define rules, and assign roles. Organizationally, problems are solved together and solutions tend to percolate from the bottom up as groups collaborate to find answers. Help scaffold by identifying opportunities for turn taking and sharing, reflecting on it and rewarding positive social behavior. We must remember that these soft skills take practice too.

## Communication

1. Raw Emotion - Just what it sounds like. At this stage parents should respond promptly and try to understand meaning to help babies expand their ability to communicate.
2. Show and Tell - Kids can share what they know, but miss much of what is unexpected or not already known. Saffold by asking questions and inviting discussion. Organizationally, we need to take other's perspectives, lest we just show-and-tell to further our own agendas.
3. Dialogue - We share something, hoping that the listener will take it, build upon it, and return more. Scaffold by prompting kids to step into the shoes of others.
4. Tell a Join Story - Building a story together, often reflected in pretend play. Scaffold by practicing good communication and demonstrating maxims below. To do this effectively, we must work to gauge what our listeners want and need. We can bolster this by asking specific questions. Scaffold by "strive for five", seeking to have five back and forth turns when we talk to our kids. Consider a family meeting as an occasion to discuss challenges and solutions.

### Paul Grice Maxims of Communication

* Maxim of Quantity - One's contribution to the conversation should be as informative as possible, but no more informative than necessary. Answer queries crisply and precisely.
* Maxim of Quality - Tell the truth, while realizing that opinions don't always need to be expressed.
* Maxim of Relation - One's contribution to the conversation should be relevant to the topic at hand.
* Maxim of Manner - How a speaker says something.

## Content

* We need to stretch the notion of content to include how to find answers and how to combine information and resources.

1. Early Learning/Situation Specific - Babies learn routines and repeating patterns, as well as imitating. All ages follow a similar process when seeking to master new domains. The new bits of knowledge are stored in their own separate bins, with little understanding.
2. Wide Breadth/Shallow Understanding - We sample more broadly, are more aware of what we know, but can get stuck on thinking particular content is either right or wrong. Children at this stage are often also fooled by how something looks, focusing on physical attributes rather than relations.
3. Making Connections - We start to understand the relations of things and look for analogies. Drama, drawing, painting, dance, and music can all help provide opportunities for this kind of deeper understanding of content. Scaffold by providing active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive learning opportunities. Active mastery of content means doing something with the material, which is often easiest if we can make it interesting and meaningful to the lives of the learner.
4. Expertise - Now understand deeply enough to free us to think about how to improve the thing and/or modify what we know. Experts can explain, demonstrate, and provide multiple examples. Scaffold by providing new experiences, encouraging them to ask questions and demonstrate fun/enthusiasm for learning (this also provides many opportunities for shared experiences).

### Executive Function, Self-Regulation, and Learning-to-Learn

* Executive Function is the ability to focus, hold, and work with information in the mind, filter distractions, and switch gears.
* Early self-regulation is linked to early success in learning and an easier tranisition to formal schooling.
* Teaching self-regulation may be even more important than teaching academic skills, as without this children may struggle to focus and pay attention.

## Critical Thinking

* Taking a skeptical stance and using reasoned judgement.

1. Seeing is Believing - Under age 4, children take things rather literally.
2. Truths Differ - We begin to realize there are differences of opinion, but simply pick one without evaluating evidence. Scaffold by questioning the source of knowledge. Humor can also be useful to teach that people don't always literally say and do what they mean.
3. Opinions - We recognize there are other viewpoints, but rely too heavily on our own reality. Fails to consider the relative value of differing opinions. Scaffold by asking questions and finding opportunities to consider evidence, ie "why do you think I don't want you to...?" We can also encourage individuals at this level to share opinions and debate.
4. Evidence or "Mastering the Intracacies of Doubt" - We start to be able to knit together information from disparate sources, while recognizing information itself isn't perfect. Scaffold by first assuming a critical stance, and then teaching how to be effectively be critical. We can, for instance, encourage hypotheses based on premises. Games can help fuel critical thinking by making us aware of rules and when they are violated. We can further scaffold by teaching how to disagree respectecfully and negotiate. We can also learn to tell our own stories (and answer questions about them). We must encourage children to question and realize things could be otherwise (often by asking why they think the current situation prevails). If they are treated with respect and their questions are taken seriously, they will feel safe to question further and move beyond what they see. To be effective, we must take care to respond to these questions in a way that they can understand.

## Creative Innovation

* Divergent thinking or creativity: generation of information from given information, where emphasis is upno variety and quantity of output
* Creative people can generate many responses (fluency) of many kinds (variety), many of which are unusual or clever (original)
* We must dispell the myths that creativity is only for special people, only occurs as part of special activities, and/or is the work of an individual.
* Champions in any domain are not content with the status quo, they seek to stretch their thinking to take on multiple perspectives.

1. Experimentation - We play with elements, devoid of a grand plan. Scaffold by supporting independence, and defering evaluation and/or physical modeling. Organizationally, we must seek to install creativity throughout the DNA of the organization (isolated, it will be unlikely to pass to the next generation of hires). We must also encourage effort, not just final products.
2. Means-Ends - We intentionally engage in creative production for extended periods toward identifiable goals. Scaffold by inviting to discover how something works, rather than being told what to do (which dampens exploration and discovery). Scaffold by making space for playing and thinking, apart from usual hustle and bustle.
3. Voice - We have built skill and technique, and know something of the domain. We can now move beyond convention to incorporate our personal expression. Creative innovation can be taught when we offer opportunities to change endings and dream up new ways to do things.
4. Vision - We recognize a problem, we are prepared by our background/education to understand shortcomings with current solutions and envision better ones, and we are resilient enough to face the early rejection that often accompanies true innovation. Slogans like "Defer judgment" and "Go for quantity [when generating ideas]" can help. We must begin by giving ourselves permission to be creative, which means taking risks and trying some things that may fail (and in doing so we model this for our children). When we invite others to be creative, they surprise us with their genius. Scaffold by not only teaching the basics, but also helping them hypothesize what could be different. Setting aside time to be creative is critical. Likewise, seeing creativity can be an important key to fostering it.

## Confidence

* Key aspects: Willingness to try and persistence.
* We must encourage experimentation, thinking, asking questions, and failure. We have to think about failure as an opportunity, rather than a defeat.

1. Barrel On - Keep going largely regardless. May be a deferred adaptation, selected for by evolution.
2. Where Do I Stand? - We compare ourselves to others. Scaffold by encouraging effort, conveying that there is more than one approach, and getting out of the way. The arts can provide opportunities for this, where there is no one right answer. Further art helps us persevere, develop executive function, envision things mentally, express these ideas, and finally to reflect on our own work and the work of others. Organizationally, we should think about becoming coaches rather than bosses, lest we become stuck in our ways.
3. Calculated Risks - We learn to think independently, embrace novelty, and question our intellectual, social, and cultural world. Scaffold by encouraging continued effort in the face of hard tasks, sometimes by helping break big tasks into little ones. Understand that sometimes risk leads to failure, where the key is being able to learn from the experience.
4. Dare to Fail - We will sometimes struggle, and we won't always understand things immediately. We can find our way through by experimenting, hypothesizing, asking questions, failing, and learning from those failures. Scaffold by modeling trying new things, and praising effort. Respond to failure not by scolding, but by asking what happened in a neutral way to help them reflect and avoid the same mistake in the future by asking "What can you do differently next time?" Try to question, rather than evaluate. Modeling how good it feels to help others can also encourage confidence and children to feel good about themselves.

## Conclusion

* We should take care to shift our focus from what children learn to how they learn, so that they become deeply curious thinkers that grow into considerate and collaborative neighbors.
* Play and learning are completely interdependent.
* Free play allows children to find their voice, figure out what they do and don't like, and gather more of the content they will need later.
* Guided play helps when adults want to teach something specific. Children learn more from guided play than didactic learning (sitting and listening).
* We must all reinvent education worthy of our children.
