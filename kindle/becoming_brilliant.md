# Becoming Brilliant: What Science Tells Us About Raising Successful Children

* The real issue confronting us is sorting through, prioritizing and making use of all the information coming at us.
* Society thrives when we craft environments that support kids to become better citizens.
* We should seek to learn alongside children, working together to construct knowledge.

## Balancing Hard and Soft Skills

* The 6Cs: collaboration, communication, content, critical thinking, creative innovation, and confidence.

1. Model born from science of learning.
2. Malleable skills to continually grow in, not traits to check off a list.
3. Focus on the learner, not teacher/parent/etc.
4. Skills adaptable to many contexts.

## Collaboration

1. On My Own - Collaboration starts with self-regulation to not become hysterical any time something goes wrong. Scaffold by offering children ways to express feelings they might not think of on their own, comforting them and/or distracting them (until they learn to do these things themselves). In organizational contexts, this may be more like management coaches scaffolding independent units to be team players.
2. Side by Side - No planning, just momentary joining to get a job done (sometimes called parallel play). If we expect collaboration and social contral, we often get it.
3. Back and Forth - Pursuing loosely defined common interests, more interest in one another than toys (sometimes called associative play). Scaffold by inviting children to join in projects and look for ways to teach that more prizes come from helping than going it alone. Organizationally, it's important to start by defining the goals of collaboration, and understanding who should collaborate (as collaboration often thrives on differences in opinion, rather than similarities).
4. Building it Together - Pairs have a clear goal, trust one another, input from each is valued, and there is a join responsibility for the result (sometimes called collaborative play). In this mode children plan together, define rules, and assign roles. Organizationally, problems are solved together and solutions tend to percolate from the bottom up as groups collaborate to find answers. Help scaffold by identifying opportunities for turn taking and sharing, reflecting on it and rewarding positive social behavior. We must remember that these soft skills take practice too.

## Communication

1. Raw Emotion - Just what it sounds like. At this stage parents should respond promptly and try to understand meaning to help babies expand their ability to communicate.
2. Show and Tell - Kids can share what they know, but miss much of what is unexpected or not already known. Saffold by asking questions and inviting discussion. Organizationally, we need to take other's perspectives, lest we just show-and-tell to further our own agendas.
3. Dialogue - We share something, hoping that the listener will take it, build upon it, and return more. Scaffold by prompting kids to step into the shoes of others.
4. Tell a Join Story - Building a story together, often reflected in pretend play. Scaffold by practicing good communication and demonstrating maxims below. To do this effectively, we must work to gauge what our listeners want and need. We can bolster this by asking specific questions. Scaffold by "strive for five", seeking to have five back and forth turns when we talk to our kids. Consider a family meeting as an occasion to discuss challenges and solutions.

### Paul Grice Maxims of Communication

* Maxim of Quantity - One's contribution to the conversation should be as informative as possible, but no more informative than necessary. Answer queries crisply and precisely.
* Maxim of Quality - Tell the truth, while realizing that opinions don't always need to be expressed.
* Maxim of Relation - One's contribution to the conversation should be relevant to the topic at hand.
* Maxim of Manner - How a speaker says something.

## Content

* We need to stretch the notion of content to include how to find answers and how to combine information and resources.

1. Early Learning/Situation Specific - Babies learn routines and repeating patterns, as well as imitating. All ages follow a similar process when seeking to master new domains. The new bits of knowledge are stored in their own separate bins, with little understanding.
2. Wide Breadth/Shallow Understanding - We sample more broadly, are more aware of what we know, but can get stuck on thinking particular content is either right or wrong. Children at this stage are often also fooled by how something looks, focusing on physical attributes rather than relations.
3. Making Connections - We start to understand the relations of things and look for analogies. Drama, drawing, painting, dance, and music can all help provide opportunities for this kind of deeper understanding of content. Scaffold by providing active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive learning opportunities. Active mastery of content means doing something with the material, which is often easiest if we can make it interesting and meaningful to the lives of the learner.
4. Expertise - Now understand deeply enough to free us to think about how to improve the thing and/or modify what we know. Experts can explain, demonstrate, and provide multiple examples. Scaffold by providing new experiences, encouraging them to ask questions and demonstrate fun/enthusiasm for learning (this also provides many opportunities for shared experiences).

### Executive Function, Self-Regulation, and Learning-to-Learn

* Executive Function is the ability to focus, hold, and work with information in the mind, filter distractions, and switch gears.
* Early self-regulation is linked to early success in learning and an easier tranisition to formal schooling.
* Teaching self-regulation may be even more important than teaching academic skills, as without this children may struggle to focus and pay attention.

## Critical Thinking

* Taking a skeptical stance and using reasoned judgement.

1. Seeing is Believing - Under age 4, children take things rather literally.
2. Truths Differ - We begin to realize there are differences of opinion, but simply pick one without evaluating evidence. Scaffold by questioning the source of knowledge. Humor can also be useful to teach that people don't always literally say and do what they mean.
3. Opinions - We recognize there are other viewpoints, but rely too heavily on our own reality. Fails to consider the relative value of differing opinions. Scaffold by asking questions and finding opportunities to consider evidence, ie "why do you think I don't want you to...?" We can also encourage individuals at this level to share opinions and debate.
4. Evidence or "Mastering the Intracacies of Doubt" - We start to be able to knit together information from disparate sources, while recognizing information itself isn't perfect. Scaffold by first assuming a critical stance, and then teaching how to be effectively be critical. We can, for instance, encourage hypotheses based on premises. Games can help fuel critical thinking by making us aware of rules and when they are violated. We can further scaffold by teaching how to disagree respectecfully and negotiate. We can also learn to tell our own stories (and answer questions about them). We must encourage children to question and realize things could be otherwise (often by asking why they think the current situation prevails). If they are treated with respect and their questions are taken seriously, they will feel safe to question further and move beyond what they see. To be effective, we must take care to respond to these questions in a way that they can understand.

## Creative Innovation

* Divergent thinking or creativity: generation of information from given information, where emphasis is upno variety and quantity of output
* Creative people can generate many responses (fluency) of many kinds (variety), many of which are unusual or clever (original)
* We must dispell the myths that creativity is only for special people, only occurs as part of special activities, and/or is the work of an individual.
* Champions in any domain are not content with the status quo, they seek to stretch their thinking to take on multiple perspectives.

1. Experimentation - We play with elements, devoid of a grand plan. Scaffold by supporting independence, and defering evaluation and/or physical modeling. Organizationally, we must seek to install creativity throughout the DNA of the organization (isolated, it will be unlikely to pass to the next generation of hires). We must also encourage effort, not just final products.
2. Means-Ends - We intentionally engage in creative production for extended periods toward identifiable goals. Scaffold by inviting to discover how something works, rather than being told what to do (which dampens exploration and discovery). Scaffold by making space for playing and thinking, apart from usual hustle and bustle.
3. Voice - We have built skill and technique, and know something of the domain. We can now move beyond convention to incorporate our personal expression. Creative innovation can be taught when we offer opportunities to change endings and dream up new ways to do things.
4. Vision - We recognize a problem, we are prepared by our background/education to understand shortcomings with current solutions and envision better ones, and we are resilient enough to face the early rejection that often accompanies true innovation. Slogans like "Defer judgment" and "Go for quantity [when generating ideas]" can help. We must begin by giving ourselves permission to be creative, which means taking risks and trying some things that may fail (and in doing so we model this for our children). When we invite others to be creative, they surprise us with their genius. Scaffold by not only teaching the basics, but also helping them hypothesize what could be different. Setting aside time to be creative is critical. Likewise, seeing creativity can be an important key to fostering it.

## Confidence

* Key aspects: Willingness to try and persistence.
* We must encourage experimentation, thinking, asking questions, and failure. We have to think about failure as an opportunity, rather than a defeat.

1. Barrel On - Keep going largely regardless. May be a deferred adaptation, selected for by evolution.
2. Where Do I Stand? - We compare ourselves to others. Scaffold by encouraging effort, conveying that there is more than one approach, and getting out of the way. The arts can provide opportunities for this, where there is no one right answer. Further art helps us persevere, develop executive function, envision things mentally, express these ideas, and finally to reflect on our own work and the work of others. Organizationally, we should think about becoming coaches rather than bosses, lest we become stuck in our ways.
3. Calculated Risks - We learn to think independently, embrace novelty, and question our intellectual, social, and cultural world. Scaffold by encouraging continued effort in the face of hard tasks, sometimes by helping break big tasks into little ones. Understand that sometimes risk leads to failure, where the key is being able to learn from the experience.
4. Dare to Fail - We will sometimes struggle, and we won't always understand things immediately. We can find our way through by experimenting, hypothesizing, asking questions, failing, and learning from those failures. Scaffold by modeling trying new things, and praising effort. Respond to failure not by scolding, but by asking what happened in a neutral way to help them reflect and avoid the same mistake in the future by asking "What can you do differently next time?" Try to question, rather than evaluate. Modeling how good it feels to help others can also encourage confidence and children to feel good about themselves.

## Conclusion

* We should take care to shift our focus from what children learn to how they learn, so that they become deeply curious thinkers that grow into considerate and collaborative neighbors.
* Play and learning are completely interdependent.
* Free play allows children to find their voice, figure out what they do and don't like, and gather more of the content they will need later.
* Guided play helps when adults want to teach something specific. Children learn more from guided play than didactic learning (sitting and listening).
* We must all reinvent education worthy of our children.

# Becoming Brilliant: What Science Tells Us About Raising Successful Children by Roberta  Michnick Golinkoff and Kathy Hirsh-Pasek
- But the real issue confronting the modern child (or the modern parent) is how we sort through, prioritize, and make use of all the information that’s coming at us on a daily basis. (250)
- society thrives when we craft environments, in and out of school, that support happy, healthy, thinking, caring, and social children who become collaborative, creative, competent, and responsible citizens (280)
- the 6Cs: collaboration, communication, content, critical thinking, creative innovation, and confidence. (287)
- One could argue that the learning industry is shaping society’s definition of success and that the learning sciences have been largely muffled in the discussion of how to best prepare children for real success in and out of school. (476)
- In 2004, the National Science Foundation began a project called the Science of Learning Centers that would fund applied research capable of moving learning science from the lab to our schools and to our living rooms. (478)
- Only people who are creative and collaborative will be able to go beyond what a well-designed robot could achieve. (512)
- The ability to learn and succeed with a single body of knowledge is just not the world we live in today. (514)
- They also value their teachers and adopt a teacher/scholar model of education in which the teachers view themselves as learning alongside the children. In other words, teachers are no longer tasked with pouring knowledge into the children’s empty heads; they are constructing knowledge together with children. (620)
- The 6Cs differ from extant models. (799)
- First, our model is born from the science of learning (799)
- Second, our skills are malleable. (801)
- These skills are not traits nor are they to be achieved once and checked off a list. (802)
- Third, our skills focus on the learner, rather than the teacher or parent. (803)
- Fourth, the skills are adaptable to many contexts, (804)
- Kindergarten students who were socially competent and did things such as sharing, cooperating, or helping other kids were more likely to attain higher education and well-paying jobs than those who were less socially competent. (823)
- We may be born to be social, but that doesn’t mean we were born with the self-control necessary for collaboration. (939)
- LEVEL 1: ON MY OWN (942)
- Collaboration is a skill that we refine throughout our lives, but that starts with the self-regulation that keeps us from getting hysterical each time something goes wrong. (945)
- Olivia’s parents will scaffold the development of her self-regulation by comforting her and distracting her (“Oh, look at the birdie!”) until she learns to do this for herself. (946)
- Sensitive parents scaffold children and offer them other ways to express their feelings, ways that children don’t think of on their own. (956)
- Want to transform your organization from a noncollaborative set of independent units to one that functions as a well-oiled community of team players? (979)
- Parental scaffolding morphs into management coaches who facilitate that change. (980)
- LEVEL 2: SIDE BY SIDE (988)
- Side by side is an advance over on my own. Toddlers know that they can use others as tools to get things done. (990)
- No planning is involved, just momentary joining to get a little job done. No surprise that scientists call this parallel play. But let’s see what is positive here. Playing separately demands that the children maintain their own space and not invade each other’s castles. At least they are controlling their impulses that much. (998)
- Day care and preschool environments can heighten or dampen children’s collaborative attempts. (1008)
- Classrooms that expect collaboration and social control from kids often get it. (1015)
- LEVEL 3: BACK AND FORTH (1050)
- In Level 3, children pursue their loosely defined common interests. But at least they are aware that there are “other” interests. They show a level of self-control (well sometimes at least) in that they don’t bash each other’s sand creations. Back in 1932, Parten called this associative play. You know you are seeing Level 3 when children appear more interested in one another than in the toys they are playing with. (1053)
- Want kids to collaborate? Have them learn that you get more prizes by helping each other than going it alone. (1074)
- Defining the goal of the collaboration is obviously the first step. (1123)
- Who should collaborate is the next question. Collaboration thrives on differences in opinion, not similarities. (1124)
- Parents can encourage Level 3 collaboration at home too by inviting their children to join them in projects. (1132)
- LEVEL 4: BUILDING IT TOGETHER (1140)
- there are some universal characteristics that underlie these collaborations: (1145)
- First, these pairs all had a clear goal: (1145)
- Second, trust between the collaborators is necessary. (1148)
- Finally, the input of each member must be valued and there must be a sense of joint responsibility for the product that emerges. This also involves having respect for one another and the self-control to let each person speak his or her mind. (1151)
- At Level 4, we see what Parten called collaborative play.27 They plan together, define rules, and assign roles to each other. (1156)
- In the best Level 4 style, communities (in business, in science, in engineering, and many others) solve problems together. Organizations that collaborate at Level 4 rarely have management offer solutions from the top down; instead, solutions percolate from the bottom up as groups work together to find answers. (1178)
- How can parents support their children’s development of Level 4 collaboration? Parents can look at their kids’ schools to see if joint projects are encouraged or if kids are always working alone (desks in rows or in circles?). If collaboration is encouraged, it means that kids understand there is a common goal and can explain it to you when you ask and that the input of each group member is valued. After-school programs should be encouraging collaboration too because kids are often starved for interacting with their peers by the time they arrive at aftercare. (1213)
- Once we’ve established that we can work together, we do so by setting up strong lines of communication that allow us to build a common vocabulary and hear one another’s narratives. (1219)
- The first step toward creating more sophisticated collaboration is by identifying opportunities for turn taking and sharing. Then by scaffolding our child’s behavior (“It would be so nice to let Alvin have the next turn”) and reflecting on what they did, we reward positive social behavior: “Wow, you were such a good sharer. Thanks for letting Alvin put that piece in the puzzle.” There are an infinite number of teachable moments that present themselves for encouraging children to work with others rather than going it alone. (1237)
- Now none of this precludes us from having downtime or from being independent. It just means that just as we seek moments to grow rugged individualism, we must also seek moments to grow our social skills. (1264)
- However, these “soft skills” take practice, too, and there are plenty of opportunities to move our children from being the independent soul to one who also embraces the chance to build something as a part of a team. (1267)
- LEVEL 1: RAW EMOTION (1342)
- When Lulu’s parents rush to the fridge they are responding contingently to her nonverbal request, acting immediately after her point and trying to understand her meaning. Our research has shown that responding contingently in this way is the best way to help babies expand their ability to communicate. (1360)
- LEVEL 2: SHOW AND TELL (1416)
- Learning in a passive Level 2 way may allow kids to pass the tests, but that’s about all. Present them with an unusual triangle and they fall right off the rails. Although many of our schools use “scripted learning,” keeping teachers from asking kids questions and following up, parents can ask kids questions at home and invite discussion. (1467)
- When we are Level 2 listeners, as management guru Peter Drucker noted, “We hear largely what we expect to hear. The unexpected is usually not received at all.” (1494)
- People in positions of authority—be it in business, academia, or nonprofit organizations—have to take the other’s perspective to communicate effectively and rise above Level 2. Otherwise, they are just communicating in show-and-tell to further their own agenda. (1498)
- LEVEL 3: DIALOGUE (1504)
- We produce a nugget to share and—taking a leap of faith—hope that our listener will hear what we have offered, build on it, and send it back to us with some new information added. Then we respond back. (1513)
- What we call conversational duets are crucial for learning to communicate; one just can’t do good communication alone. (1519)
- conversations work. People who are good communicators take the perspective of their listener. Level 3 conversations require what psychologists call a theory of mind. (1528)
- Teachers and parents help their children achieve Level 3 when they prompt kids to step into the shoes of the other. (1568)
- LEVEL 4: TELL A JOINT STORY (1579)
- This is Level 4 communication, reflected in pretend play. It rises above Level 3—dialogue—not because of the costumes or the content but because the children are building a story together. (1583)
- Paul Grice, a British philosopher of language, developed a set of maxims to describe the best communication practices. (1630)
- The maxim of quantity holds that one’s contribution to the conversation should be as informative as possible but no more informative than necessary. Answering queries crisply and precisely works best. (1634)
- The maxim of quality is ‘tell the truth.’ (1638)
- The maxim of quality has its limits, however. Telling the truth is a fine rule to live by, except when telling the truth goes beyond what people need to hear. Most adults realize that their opinion needn’t always be expressed. (1646)
- The maxim of relation holds that a conversational tidbit should be relevant to the topic at hand. (1653)
- Finally, there is the maxim of manner, or how a speaker says something. (1656)
- Level 4 communication depends on following these maxims—and knowing how and when to apply them. (1660)
- Where can kids learn the maxims of good communication? These are not explicitly taught. Communication takes practice. (1666)
- Level 4 does not come from the air; parents and teachers have to make an effort to observe the maxims themselves if they want kids to learn them. (1680)
- One of the things that make it hardest for us to reach Level 4 is gauging what our listeners want and need. (1681)
- What can we do to bring back that feeling and to use communication as the family glue? We can ask specific questions. (1698)
- Our colleague David Dickinson at Vanderbilt uses the unforgettable phrase “strive for five” to remind us to have five back and forth turns when we talk to our kids, to keep the conversation going. (1725)
- In our homes, we created opportunities for conversation through the revered family meeting. (1745)
- The family meeting allowed children to move from whining to discussing. (1750)
- So much of parenting is about using language to share our expectations. (1755)
- The point is that we can create contexts and settings that shut down or open up opportunities for communication. Just as we planfully take a child from multiplication to division to fractions, we can be thoughtful about the kinds of experiences that enable children to move through the levels of communication to become welcome and respected contributors to Level 4 dialogues. (1758)
- We need to stretch the definition of content to include HOW to find the answers needed to solve the problem and HOW to put together the information and resources to make it possible. (1865)
- LEVEL 1: EARLY LEARNING/SITUATION SPECIFIC (1871)
- To help make sense of their complex world, babies grab onto routines and scout out repeating patterns. (1880)
- They also calculate statistics about how often things occur together. (1882)
- Another way babies learn is by imitation. (1892)
- To be sure, this kind of learning is situation specific and often not very flexible. What children—and even adults who are learning at Level 1—do is store their bits of knowledge in separate bins. There is little understanding. For example, at Level 1, sometimes people do things they see others do but really don’t know why. (1909)
- Level 1 happens to all of us when we seek to master a new domain. (1924)
- Even adolescents and adults use these same Level 1 learning methods. We imitate, we calculate statistics, and we make associations. (1952)
- LEVEL 2: WIDE BREADTH/SHALLOW UNDERSTANDING (1954)
- We know more at Level 2. We sample from a wider buffet with more choices of topics than we knew at Level 1. (1955)
- And in Level 2, knowledge is more explicit. We are more aware of what we know. (1964)
- The idea that content is either right or wrong is also Level 2 thinking. (1972)
- At Level 1, children ride on the surface of knowledge; at Level 2, although kids can still be fooled by how something looks, they can sometimes go beyond what they see. (1975)
- When children go beyond the surface, they can think using analogies. (1993)
- Although kids and adults alike use analogy all the time to learn, people who think at content Level 2 focus on physical attributes, unless they’re explicitly told otherwise, as in the shark–dolphin example. We have to wait for Level 3 for kids to focus on the relations that the objects share. (2005)
- LEVEL 3: MAKING CONNECTIONS (2108)
- EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, SELF-REGULATION, AND LEARNING-TO-LEARN SKILLS (2120)
- Being able to focus, hold, and work with information in mind, filter distractions, and switch gears is like having an air traffic control system at a busy airport to manage the arrivals and departures of dozens of planes on multiple runways. In the brain, this air traffic control mechanism is called executive function. (2127)
- Preschoolers’ self-regulation is linked to their early literacy, vocabulary, and math skills and helps them transition to a more structured and formal schooling environment once they reach kindergarten. (2141)
- Teaching children how to regulate their own behaviors may be even more important than teaching academic skills. (2145)
- The learning industry doesn’t talk much about executive functions skills, but learning scientists have shown repeatedly that children who can’t focus and pay attention can’t learn nearly as well as those who can. (2147)
- By age 10, the switching gears part of executive function skills becomes easier too. This lets children extend their knowledge to new situations. In Level 3, children shift their attention to relations—to the connections things share and not just how they look. (2149)
- Drama invites kids to look for analogies between the characters and the situations in the play and the people and situations children face in real life. Now that is deep learning. Drama increases children’s empathy for others because it requires the actor to step into someone else’s shoes. (2167)
- Drawing and painting, dance, music, and drama enhance children’s capacities for learning information deeply. (2175)
- The arts offer students an opportunity to move to Level 3 by encouraging and nurturing deep understanding of content. (2188)
- The four keys to learning that promotes Levels 3 and 4 can be encapsulated in a tweet: Active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive. (2191)
- The active mastery of content means doing something with the material. (2194)
- mental effort than working on a group project. Putting on a play, writing a joint paper, and writing a persuasive essay on giving to charity are all examples of how children can learn actively. (2195)
- Kids’ motivation is high to learn about a topic they are really interested in. (2207)
- Making learning meaningful is about linking it to our lives. Years of research has taught us that tying new learning to what we already know makes the learning “stick.” (2214)
- Deeper learning happens through social interaction. We don’t mean when Raymond and Carol just sit together; we mean when they jointly construct what they need to learn. (2224)
- LEVEL 4: EXPERTISE (2243)
- At Level 4, we gain expertise in an area—whether it is running that luncheonette, coaching that team, or driving that taxi—and that frees us to think about how to improve and modify what we know. (2245)
- The PISA test given to 14-year-olds around the world helps us understand what an expert can do that children at earlier levels can’t. Students who score really well can link up the ideas they learned in algebra with ideas they learned in trigonometry. They can identify when constraints operate on problem solution (I can’t use this strategy in this kind of problem), and they can flexibly translate between solution types. They can even apply insights they develop on the spot to forge new relationships to help themselves. (2260)
- Experts can explain and demonstrate and come up with multiple examples. (2291)
- There are teachable moments everywhere that can deepen your children’s understanding of the world and encourage them to ask questions. Children who are having fun learning outside of school are more likely to want to learn in school too. (2335)
- Are you open to going new places and learning new things? We know that you cannot be an expert in everything. No one can. But there are times when we all need to stretch to learn new information. (2342)
- Answering children’s questions in an honest and forthright way and modeling enthusiasm about how you learn is a wonderful gift to them. (2353)
- Remember that the four pillars fueling learning that we described as active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive are not academic abstractions but real ways to help kids more deeply understand what they are learning. (2363)
- Even if your child’s school does not engage in many art projects, you could do that with the content your child is learning. (2376)
- Fueling your children’s imagination through the arts is a great way to enrich their thinking and build their executive function skills too. (2383)
- We also took our children to arts performances. (2396)
- Don’t forget children’s museums for spurring your child’s love of learning. (2399)
- Research by Catherine Haden and her colleagues has shown that talking about what you have seen after you come home builds your children’s memory. (2403)
- Any place you go becomes an adventure to learn from if you are a child—especially if you have a parent who talks with you about what you are noticing and follows up with good answers to your questions. (2408)
- Although content should not be king, it is definitely important for children to learn content. But it is also important for them to learn how to learn and how to be life-long learners like their parents. (2411)
- If your children see you loving to learn, most of the time they will too. If your children believe that you take their questions seriously and try to get them answers or help them find answers, they will learn to do that for themselves. And if we recognize that content is everywhere—not just confined inside school walls—we will enrich our lives and our children’s lives. (2412)
- The road to success is paved with experiences you share with your children. (2416)
- Children thrive when we spend time with them so find those teachable moments all around you and help your children ask questions and probe for more! (2417)
- Critical thinking is evidenced when we take a skeptical stance. (2470)
- Critical thinking is using “reasoned judgment.”5 And teaching critical thinking will require that children learn how to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information that comes from all sorts of places—from “observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication.” (2478)
- LEVEL 1: SEEING IS BELIEVING (2498)
- Children under age 4 are likely to see and believe, hence the name of this first level. (2522)
- LEVEL 2: TRUTHS DIFFER (2552)
- At Level 2, we recognize differences in opinion and simply pick one. We make black or white judgments without evaluating the evidence. But Level 2 is progress: children can now recognize that truths differ for different people. (2554)
- But starting at around age 4, kids also begin to weigh an individual’s level of expertise to decide what is true. (2563)
- By age 4 or 5, children know that other minds exist. Interestingly, this is just what many children with autism lack, although there is big variation. (2574)
- Questioning children about the source of their knowledge implicitly teaches them that parroting is not enough. We need to know how we know something. (2582)
- Families are all different. Some make jokes and puns a lot. Families who use humor are setting children up for understanding that people don’t always say and do what they mean. (2583)
- Deanna Kuhn referred to people in Level 2 as absolutists—either a “fact” is true or not true.21 Level 2 people think reality is obvious—it’s pretty much what you can see. (2597)
- Level 2 thinking can affect the likelihood that you will be depressed. The term metacognition captures the way we think about thinking. (2603)
- LEVEL 3: OPINIONS (2621)
- Level 3 thinkers are happy to stop at “they say” for two reasons. First, “they say” acknowledges that people think differently. Second, because “they say” sets a low bar for evidence, it gets the speaker off the hook: “I don’t have any evidence for this, but someone does.” (2622)
- At Level 3, opinion, people recognize that there are other points of view but still rely too heavily on their own personal reality. They can even understand that reality is not so clear and that others can experience different realities. (2632)
- This is Level 3 critical thinking: The column acknowledged that there are differing opinions but then raised personal belief to the same level as the evidence captured in a large-scale scientific study. (2638)
- Critical thinking involves considering “Who says what to whom?”30 Do we know enough about the who? (2651)
- Children who can consistently think at Level 3 tend to be middle school age. These are the kids Professor Diana Kuhn called multiplists because they realize that authors express their opinions rather than facts. (2684)
- The key to engaging in critical thinking is to question and not just accept the first “answer” that comes along. Understanding is enriched by asking questions about why things are done the way they are. (2692)
- How do students get there? Critical thinking can be taught. Of course, asking questions is just one part of critical thinking. We also need to find opportunities to have children consider the evidence. This starts when they are little. Help them put themselves in someone else’s shoes: “Why do you think I don’t want you to hit your brother?” Not only will this encourage questioning and critical thinking but it will also model your thinking processes in your selection of punishments. (2695)
- Nothing is safe from the critical scrutiny of adolescents who can now imagine different realities. This sometimes-annoying quality can also be harnessed by asking them to actively think about alternatives with you: “How else could we have laid out the living room?” (2702)
- At school at Level 3 we can encourage students to share opinions and to debate. (2705)
- LEVEL 4: EVIDENCE OR “MASTERING THE INTRICACIES OF DOUBT” (2713)
- “The ability to knit together information from disparate sources into a coherent whole is vital today.”43 It “involves selecting crucial information from the copious amounts available” (p. 155) and then using it for the current task. (2730)
- Level 4 is where people, as Candice Mills wrote, “master the intricacies of doubt.”45 We do the best we can to gather information to solve a problem. But we recognize the information itself isn’t perfect. (2739)
- Psychologist Diane Halpern argued that there are several components to teaching critical thinking skills.51 The first is dispositional or attitudinal. This is parallel to assuming a critical stance. Remember the old “question authority”? Even people in positions of power don’t know everything. (2781)
- Second, there are ways to teach critical thinking skills—as Robert Sternberg has argued.52 Helping students become critical of what they hear, like the commercials on TV, is one way to approach this. (2786)
- Other ways to heighten critical thinking are to help students find and evaluate arguments in written or oral communication and to generate hypotheses based on the premises. (2792)
- We can all improve our critical thinking skills. We can all seek answers to the questions that face us on a daily basis. (2826)
- Playing games, telling funny stories, reading books, asking why—these are all ways to spur your child’s critical thinking skills. (2829)
- Games fuel critical thinking because they make children aware of rules and when they are violated. (2830)
- Disagreeing is not bad though and fuels the development of critical thinking. If we instill the ability to disagree with others but in a respectful way (no hitting, no shouting), we can watch our children solve these problems with their siblings and peers (most of the time). Learning to negotiate is part of communication too, and learning how to be critical is an important skill for children to learn. (2832)
- Storytelling is a lost art. But a good storyteller is a pleasure to listen to. Parents and caregivers can tell their own stories. (2835)
- Questioning is necessary to learn about the world and to develop a critical stance. (2837)
- Reading books is a great place to use critical thinking. (2838)
- Children are greatly motivated (aren’t we all?) to understand what makes people tick. It removes some of the unpredictability from their social relationships if they can figure out why others act in surprising ways. These are great opportunities for discussion if we don’t shut them down by saying, “Because he’s a bad boy.” We can ask children to think about what would make Bobby do that. (2845)
- We have to encourage children to question and realize things could be otherwise. (2850)
- If you are feeling really ambitious, you can even invent new games to build critical thinking while you are on family vacations. (2851)
- Controlling teachers and parents tend to shut down children’s questioning. (2861)
- Almost any place you go with your children gives you an opportunity to ask why and to stretch their thinking. Why do they think the current situation prevails? (2867)
- Small everyday conversations like these are golden opportunities to invite your children to think and question, all prerequisites to becoming critical thinkers. (2871)
- If children are treated with respect, if their questions are taken seriously, they will feel safe to question and to move beyond the information that they see. (2873)
- Sensitive and responsive parenting or parenting that takes children’s perspectives into account and responds to them in ways that they can understand is key. (2875)
- Guilford described divergent thinking (and hence creativity) as the “generation of information from given information, where emphasis is upon variety and quantity of output.” (2918)
- A creative person is one who can generate many responses (i.e., fluency) of many different kinds (i.e., variety), many of which are unusual or clever (i.e., original). (2922)
- Not only is creativity for “special people” (Myth 1) but it is also about “special activities”—like the arts (Myth 2). (2932)
- Finally, the third myth about creativity: Robinson thinks that when we use the word creativity, people have an image of a single individual running in circles (or with scissors) wearing a court jester’s hat and screaming wildly. (2953)
- Champions in any domain (he has studied athletes and political leaders from around the world) are not content with the status quo. They stretch their thinking in ways that take multiple perspectives. (2973)
- LEVEL 1: EXPERIMENTATION (2989)
- Explorers and discoverers “play” with elements devoid of a grand plan. (2994)
- At Level 1, children are uninhibited by conventions because they don’t know many. They are still learning how the world works. (3002)
- If we let the children know that they can create, that they can experiment, then we begin to develop a mind-set that is creative and artistic from its inception. (3008)
- Parents who support kids’ independence tend to have children who are more creative than those who don’t. (3015)
- Research tells us that if there is too much evaluation of new ideas rather than letting them flow freely, or if a physical model is fashioned too early in the process, it shuts down the creative process. (3017)
- Howard Gardner, the psychologist and author, has argued that the divide-and-conquer strategy of isolating creativity to a small group within a company no longer works: “If creativity does not infiltrate the DNA of an organization, it is unlikely to be passed on to the next generation that joins the company.” (3025)
- Having environments in which it is safe for creativity to emerge also means encouraging effort. We should applaud drafts, not just final products, and we should encourage the hard work that creativity involves. (3029)
- LEVEL 2: MEANS–END (3042)
- Children at Level 2 intentionally engage in creative production for extended periods of time, directing it toward a goal they can identify. We can think of Level 2 as using the same means (i.e., materials) to create diverse ends and also as using different means (e.g., blocks, paint, clay) to create the same end: that hairy scary monster. (3049)
- Interestingly, when kids are invited to creatively discover how something works, they do better than when they are told what to do. (3052)
- Thus, although teaching is really an efficient way to tell kids about how the toy works, it also dampens exploration and discovery. (3061)
- In school, children allowed to explore potential solutions to problems are likely to be more creative than those taught the right answer and given step-by-step instructions. (3071)
- The same is true for another type of problem solving: Applying what you have learned to new instances, or transfer. (3074)
- Of course, nurturing creative thinking demands that we take a break from the usual hustle and bustle of our lives and that we make space for playing and thinking. (3112)
- LEVEL 3: VOICE (3122)
- Creativity, in his view, is more an incremental process than a giant aha! experience. To reach the higher levels of creativity, a child or adult has to master skill and technique and typically know something about the domain. (3124)
- At Level 3, folks know a bunch about the area in which they work. They have “prepared minds,” so when they see an opportunity for a better mousetrap, using their critical thinking they can seize it and bring that niggling idea to fruition. (3147)
- Cornell professor Robert Sternberg pointed out that creativity depends on practical skills too.28 To create a prototype of that new mousetrap, to bring it to the attention of the right mousetrap makers, and to ultimately brand and market it requires additional skills beyond the creativity to invent the design. (3153)
- Moving beyond convention, at Level 3 we incorporate our own personal expression. (3164)
- Creative innovation can be taught, as Robert Sternberg argued, when we offer children the opportunity to change endings and dream up totally new ways to do things. (3169)
- LEVEL 4: VISION (3185)
- These seemingly disparate examples have three important things in common. The first is a great irony: The best ideas are often initially rejected—and rejected outright because truly innovative ideas take people outside their comfort zone and seem wacky—whether in the arts (e.g., many publishers rejected Harry Potter) or science (e.g., ulcers are not caused by stress!) or engineering (e.g., Atari and Hewlett-Packard rejected Steven Wozniak’s personal computer pitch). (3201)
- The second thing these examples have in common is that they all represent what we call Level 4 creativity: Vision. (3205)
- Without recognizing that there was a problem to solve (i.e., critical thinking), these inventions would never have come into being. (3208)
- Finally, these breakthrough examples have something else in common: preparation. Individuals who succeed at this level need background and usually some education in their area to comprehend the shortcomings in current solutions and envision better ones. (3210)
- Adults live in fear of the judgment of others. (3240)
- Slogans such as “Defer judgment” and “Go for quantity [when generating ideas]!” help adults regain their lost freedom to avoid self-censoring and just let the ideas flow. (3242)
- Another rule is to create a low-resolution physical prototype of an idea quickly so it can be manipulated and more readily envisioned. (3243)
- Creative thinking depends on communication and collaboration, but there is still more to it. One of the most interesting things about creative people is that they don’t give up. (3255)
- As a first step, we have to look inward and ask whether we give ourselves permission to be creative in our jobs and in our homes. Being creative means taking risks and trying out some things that are destined to fail. (3269)
- When we are willing to be creative ourselves, we model that for our children. (3276)
- The point is, we have to leave the humdrum that comes with routine and regulation, schedule and expectation, to give ourselves the chance to be creative. When we do, we open new possibilities for ourselves and let our children know that divergent thinking is a plus. (3284)
- Could we all take 15 minutes out of each day and let our kids invent? (3286)
- We tend to buy construction toys that ask the child to assemble parts rather than buying the loose parts, and we tend to stick to instructions or to the stories in the book rather than generating new ones. (3291)
- When children know that they are allowed to be creative, they surprise us with their genius. (3302)
- As our children grow their creative expertise, we can challenge them to not only learn the basics but also to hypothesize about what could be different. (3308)
- There are many ways to make your lives more creative. The first is to have space and time to nurture creative thinking and to applaud it, even if it does not always reap what you expect. (3320)
- Seeing creativity is also key to fostering it. (3326)
- If they see it, they can do it, or at least try it. (3328)
- Confidence has two components. The first is the willingness to try. (3363)
- The second aspect of confidence is persistence. (3365)
- If we are to prepare our children to be explorers on the frontier of ideas, we must encourage them to experiment, think, ask questions, and yes, fail, so that they can learn from their failures and try again. (3375)
- We have to think about failure as an opportunity rather than as a defeat. (3390)
- LEVEL 1: BARREL ON! (3410)
- Cognitive immaturity and the persistence that accompanies it may well be a “deferred adaptation,” selected for by evolution. (3416)
- Confidence is also manifest in our social interactions. A certain level of confidence is needed to interact with people we don’t know. (3430)
- LEVEL 2: WHERE DO I STAND? (3448)
- Praising effort tells us that what matters is how hard we tried; getting the right answers is not what the task is all about. (3484)
- When people are concerned about where they stand, they are likely to avoid tasks and situations they believe exceed their capabilities. (3485)
- Parents’ getting out of the way helps children build confidence. (3529)
- Another way to encourage confidence is to convey the idea that there is more than one way to do a task. (3532)
- Another way to feed children’s confidence is through the arts, where there is no one right answer. (3537)
- As Ellen Winner and her colleagues have shown, the arts build habits of the mind.24 One of these habits is to “engage and persist”—learning to persevere builds confidence and fuels the development of executive function skill. Two more are “envision” and “express.” If you can picture mentally what you can’t see and learn to convey this through some form of art, you are then in a position to “reflect”—to judge your own work and the work of others. (3538)
- These studio habits also encourage “stretching and exploring” as they foster the creativity and confidence needed to encourage experimentation. (3544)
- This is why business writers like Chris Musselwhite have suggested that CEOs become coaches rather than bosses.25 Unless the environment supports risk taking and innovation, a business is likely to flounder as it remains stuck in its ways. (3548)
- LEVEL 3: CALCULATED RISKS (3555)
- What children play with matters for their confidence in the short term and for what they think others like them can accomplish. (3576)
- As children become more competent in their everyday lives, they become better at knowing what they can and cannot do. This is calculating risk. (3591)
- In an educational system that thrives on getting one correct answer rather than on the process of learning, students lose their motivation to take risks because outperforming their classmates is sufficient. (3593)
- When children learn how to take calculated risks, they learn to think independently, embrace novelty, and question their intellectual, social, and cultural world. (3596)
- Parents play a big role here because if they encourage children to keep trying when they encounter hard tasks—like homework—children will continue to try new things and not shut down to experimentation. (3600)
- Sometimes breaking big tasks up into little ones is all your children need to know they can succeed. (3604)
- Even calculated risks will occasionally lead to failures. The key is being able to learn from them. (3631)
- Apparently, executives are concerned that if they don’t blame someone, people will think that anything goes and standards will be lowered. (3634)
- LEVEL 4: DARE TO FAIL (3639)
- If we are to prepare students to enter the frontier of ideas in a fast changing world, our educational system must include lessons on experimenting, hypothesizing, asking questions, and failing, so that students learn from mistakes. (3653)
- Parents often have trouble praising the process of learning because they are so focused on the outcome. (3668)
- on a hard task. When interviewed, the researchers made clear that high-stakes tests and emphasis on grades—just what the United States is doing now—is the exact opposite of what their research supported. Children have to be given space to struggle and not to expect that if they don’t understand immediately, they should just give up. (3689)
- In other words, and as Carol Dweck argued, if we help students understand that the brain is like a muscle that gets better with exercise, students are much more likely to keep trying when they hit obstacles. (3695)
- If we believe that members of our group—whatever that group is—should not do well, we create a self-fulfilling prophecy and do poorly. If we believe that members of our group should do well, we increase our performance. (3714)
- We could go on and on. The key to dare to fail, our last level of confidence, is to have the passion to realize what is needed, whether it is equal treatment for African Americans or a way to allow people to live on with heart disease or capitalizing on a chance invention as Gore did on the fabric that bears his name. (3751)
- When you tell your kids you are trying something new, they will support you and be inspired by your actions. (3771)
- One way to build confidence is to make sure you are not praising children for their smarts. Praise for effort. (3779)
- We want to encourage them to try and to move on even if they fail. (3781)
- When your child does something wrong or fails in a task, scolding will not be half as effective for building confidence as asking what happened in a truly neutral tone. (3782)
- Whenever we can make children think (remember deep processing?), they are less likely to make the same mistake next time. (3784)
- A follow-up of, “What can you do differently next time?” puts the onus of the problem on the child, and the child has to think it through. Confidence comes from seeing that you could have done better and that you know the route to take! (3785)
- Try not to evaluate but to question. (3795)
- Outside your home, consider what your children can do to build their confidence and persistence. (3808)
- If we let them learn how good it feels to help others, they will surely feel good about themselves. (3810)
- They are active explorers of their world, constantly interacting and creating, discovering and testing, as parents and teachers shift their focus from what children learn to how they learn. Children who grow up in these kinds of settings become deeply curious thinkers and grow into considerate and collaborative neighbors. (3826)
- “Play and learning are completely interdependent,” (3971)
- The games we played as children set the stage for us to understand how democracies work. Play is powerful. (3982)
- Free play is the butterfly; children don’t even realize how much they are learning when they are playing. (3984)
- Free play, whether alone or with peers or adults, allows kids to find their voice, to figure out what they like and don’t like, and to pick up lots of content they will need for school. (3992)
- But what we call guided play helps children learn when adults want to teach them something specific. (3996)
- Think of following children’s interests, answering their questions, and telling them what they want to know or helping them find the answers—all in the context of playing that board game or walking around the zoo. This is guided play. (3999)
- Children learn more in guided play than didactic instruction (sitting and listening). (4002)
- We must all reinvent an education that is worthy of our children. (4072)
