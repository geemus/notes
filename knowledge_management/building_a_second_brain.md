# Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential by Tiago Forte

## Chapter 2: What Is a Second Brain? (219)

- This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. (278)
- However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. (280)
- For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head. (308)
- The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note. (312)
- A knowledge building block is discrete. It stands on its own and has intrinsic value, but knowledge building blocks can also be combined into something much greater—a report, an argument, a proposal, a story. (314)

## Chapter 3: How a Second Brain Works (428)

- Think of your Second Brain as the world’s best personal assistant. (431)
- Second Brain Superpower #1: Make Our Ideas Concrete (444) - Digital notes aren’t physical, but they are visual. They turn vague concepts into tangible entities that can be observed, rearranged, edited, and combined together. (457)
- Second Brain Superpower #2: Reveal New Associations Between Ideas (461) - By keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we facilitate this connectivity and increase the likelihood that we’ll notice an unusual association. (466)
- Second Brain Superpower #3: Incubate Our Ideas Over Time (473)- This tendency is known as recency bias. We tend to favor the ideas, solutions, and influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are the best ones. Now imagine if you were able to unshackle yourself from the limits of the present moment, and draw on weeks, months, or even years of accumulated imagination. (478)
- Second Brain Superpower #4: Sharpen Our Unique Perspectives (484) - When you feel stuck in your creative pursuits, it doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with you. You haven’t lost your touch or run out of creative juice. It just means you don’t yet have enough raw material to work with. (498)

### Choosing a Notetaking App: The Neural Center of Your Second Brain (502)

- digital notes apps have four powerful characteristics that make them ideal for building a Second Brain: Multimedia, Informal, Open-ended, and Action-oriented: (517)
- They are designed to help you quickly capture stray thoughts so you can remain focused on the task at hand. (517)
- All four of the above qualities are shared by paper notes, but when we make them digital, we can supercharge these timeless benefits with the incredible capabilities of technology—searching, sharing, backups, editing, linking, syncing between devices, and many others. (518)
- Most important of all, don’t get caught in the trap of perfectionism: insisting that you have to have the “perfect” app with a precise set of features before you take a single note. It’s not about having the perfect tools—it’s about having a reliable set of tools you can depend on, knowing you can always change them later. (529)

### Remembering, Connecting, Creating: The Three Stages of Personal Knowledge Management (532)

- The second way that people use their Second Brain is to connect ideas together. Their Second Brain evolves from being primarily a memory tool to becoming a thinking tool. (541)
- Eventually, the third and final way that people use their Second Brain is for creating new things. They realize that they have a lot of knowledge on a subject and decide to turn it into something concrete and shareable. (548)
- Introducing The CODE Method: The Four Steps to Remembering What Matters (559) - To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express. (560)

### Capture: Keep What Resonates (573)

- We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds. (577)
- The solution is to keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control, and to leave the rest aside. (583)
- Don’t make it an analytical decision, and don’t worry about why exactly it resonates—just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact. (586)
- By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of ourselves and what makes us tick. (588)

### Organize: Save for Actionability (592)

- The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?” (600)
- Organizing for action gives you a sense of tremendous clarity, because you know that everything you’re keeping actually has a purpose. (604)
- Instead of organizing being an obstacle to your productivity, it becomes a contributor to it. (605)

### Distill: Find the Essence (606)

- Once you start capturing ideas in a central place and organizing them for action, you’ll inevitably begin to notice patterns and connections between them. (607)
- Why is it so important to be able to easily find the main point of a note? Because in the midst of a busy workday, you won’t have time to review ten pages of notes on a book you read last year—you need to be able to quickly find just the main takeaways. (617)
- Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention. (621)

### Express: Show Your Work (625)

- All the previous steps—capturing, organizing, and distilling—are geared toward one ultimate purpose: sharing your own ideas, your own story, and your own knowledge with others. (625)
- A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it. (630)
- It’s so easy to endlessly delay and postpone the experiences that would so enrich our lives. (633)
- Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. (636)
- This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating. (637)
- Information is always in flux, and it is always a work in progress. (648)
- The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement. (650)
- Here’s the surprising truth: you are already doing most of the work required. (652)
- All you need is a slightly more intentional, more deliberate way to manage that information, plus a few practical habits to ensure it gets done. (655)

## PART TWO The Method The Four Steps of CODE (678)

## Chapter 4: Capture—Keep What Resonates (681)

- Innovation and impact don’t happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends on a creative process. (730)

### Creating a Knowledge Bank: How to Generate Compounding Interest from Your Thoughts (732)

- Knowing how they were going to be putting ideas to use gave them a powerful lens for seeing which ones were worth the trouble of writing down. (734)
- Software engineers build “code libraries” so useful bits of code are easy to access. (737)
- In the digital world we live in, knowledge most often shows up as “content”—snippets of text, screenshots, bookmarked articles, podcasts, or other kinds of media. (743)
- These aren’t just random artifacts with no value—they are “knowledge assets” that crystallize what you know in concrete form. (746)
- Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts. (754)
- External knowledge could include: Highlights, Quotes, Bookmarks and favorites, Voice memos, Meeting notes, Images, and Takeaways: (760)
- As you start collecting this material from the outer world, it often sparks new ideas and realizations in your inner world. You can capture those thoughts too! (763)
- They could include: Stories, Insights, Memories, Reflections, and Musings
- The meaning of a thought, insight, or memory often isn’t immediately clear. We need to write them down, revisit them, and view them from a different perspective in order to digest what they mean to us. (769)
- For now, choose the two to three kinds of content from the two lists above that you already have the most of and already value. (775)
- While you can eventually learn to capture from dozens of different sources, it’s important to start small and get your feet wet before diving into the deep end. (776)

### What Not to Keep (778)

- In my experience, there are four kinds of content that aren’t well suited to notes apps: (779)
  - Is this sensitive information you’d like to keep secure? (780)
  - Is this a special format or file type better handled by a dedicated app? (783)
  - Is this a very large file? (785)
  - Will it need to be collaboratively edited? (787)

### Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner’s Approach to Capturing (790)

- Feynman revealed his strategy in an interview4: You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” (800)
- When a fellow physicist and mentor asked what the use of such an insight was, Feynman responded: “It doesn’t have any importance… I don’t care whether a thing has importance. Isn’t it fun?” He was following his intuition and curiosity. But it did end up having importance, with his research into the equations underlying rotation informing the work that ultimately led to him receiving the Nobel Prize. (815)
- Ask yourself, “What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?” (820)
- The key to this exercise is to make them open-ended questions that don’t necessarily have a single answer. To find questions that invoke a state of wonder and curiosity about the amazing world we live in. (835)
- The power of your favorite problems is that they tend to stay fairly consistent over time. (836)
- Take a moment now to write down some of your own favorite problems. Here are my recommendations to guide you: (848) Ask people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child (often you’ll continue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult). (849)
- Don’t worry about coming up with exactly twelve (the exact number doesn’t matter, but try to come up with at least a few). (850)
- Don’t worry about getting the list perfect (this is just a first pass, and it will always be evolving). (851)
- Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in contrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer). (852)
- Use your list of favorite problems to make decisions about what to capture: anything potentially relevant to answering them. (853)

### Capture Criteria: How to Avoid Keeping Too Much (or Too Little) (856)

- This is where most people get stuck. They either dive straight into the first piece of content they see, read it voraciously, but quickly forget all the details, or they open dozens of tabs in their web browser and feel a pang of guilt at all those interesting resources they haven’t been able to get to. (864)
- There is a way out of this situation. It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you. When you realize this, the answer is obvious. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note. (866)
- This is why it’s so important to take on a Curator’s Perspective—that we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. Thinking like a curator means taking charge of your own information stream, instead of just letting it wash over you. (875)
- Capture Criteria #1: Does It Inspire Me? (880)
  - There is a way to evoke a sense of inspiration more regularly: keep a collection of inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories. Any time you need a break, a new perspective, or a dash of motivation, you can look through it and see what sparks your imagination. (882)
- Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful? (886)
  - Carpenters are known for keeping odds and ends in a corner of their workshop—a variety of nails and washers, scraps of lumber cut off from larger planks, and random bits of metal and wood. (887)
  - Sometimes you come across a piece of information that isn’t necessarily inspiring, but you know it might come in handy in the future. (889)
- Capture Criteria #3: Is It Personal? (894)
  - One of the most valuable kinds of information to keep is personal information—your own thoughts, reflections, memories, and mementos. (894)
  - No one else has access to the wisdom you’ve personally gained from a lifetime of conversations, mistakes, victories, and lessons learned. No one else values the small moments of your days quite like you do. (896)
- Capture Criteria #4: Is It Surprising? (900)
  - If you’re not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it? Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn’t fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think. (906)
  - Your Second Brain shouldn’t be just another way of confirming what you already know. (910)
  - Our ability to capture ideas from anywhere takes us in a different direction: By saving ideas that may contradict each other and don’t necessarily support what we already believe, we can train ourselves to take in information from different sources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. By playing with ideas—bending and stretching and remixing them—we become less attached to the way they were originally presented and can borrow certain aspects or elements to use in our own work. (912)

### Ultimately, Capture What Resonates (916)

- Here’s why: making decisions analytically, with a checklist, is taxing and stressful. (918)
- The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable. (922)
- We know from neuroscientific research that “emotions organize—rather than disrupt—rational thinking.”8 When something resonates with us, it is our emotion-based, intuitive mind telling us it is interesting before our logical mind can explain why. (927)
- I can’t think of anything more important for your creative life—and your life in general—than learning to listen to the voice of intuition inside. It is the source of your imagination, your confidence, and your spontaneity. You can intentionally train yourself to hear that voice of intuition every day by taking note of what it tells you. (941)
- Besides capturing what personally resonates with you, there are a couple other kinds of details that are generally useful to save in your notes. It’s a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher, and the date it was published. (943)
- Also, it’s often helpful to capture chapter titles, headings, and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to your notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your behalf. (946)
- Beyond Your Notetaking App: Choosing Capture Tools (949)
- Here are some of the most popular ways of using capture tools to save content you come across: (972)
- Capturing: passages from ebooks, excerpts from online articles or web pages, quotes from podcasts, voice memos, parts of YouTube videos, excerpts from emails, and content from other apps

### The Surprising Benefits of Externalizing Our Thoughts (991)

- First, you are much more likely to remember information you’ve written down in your own words. Known as the “Generation Effect,” (995)
- There is even significant evidence that expressing our thoughts in writing can lead to benefits for our health and well-being. (1003)
- Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is that we escape what I call the “reactivity loop”—the hamster wheel of urgency, outrage, and sensationalism that characterizes so much of the Internet. The moment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity. (1010)
- I’m always amazed that when I revisit the items I’ve previously saved to read later, many of them that seemed so important at the time are clearly trivial and unneeded. (1015)

### Your Turn: What Would This Look Like If It Was Easy? (1019)

- I want to give you an open question that will help guide you as you embark on this journey: What would capturing ideas look like if it was easy? (1021)
- Capture isn’t about doing more. It’s about taking notes on the experiences you’re already having. It’s about squeezing more juice out of the fruit of life, savoring every moment to the fullest by paying closer attention to the details. (1028)

## Chapter 5 - Organize—Save for Actionability (1056)

### The Cathedral Effect: Designing a Space for Your Ideas (1106)

- There’s a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. (1110)
- No one questions the importance of having physical spaces that make us feel calm and centered, but when it comes to your digital workspace, it’s likely you’ve spent little time, if any, arranging that space to enhance your productivity or creativity. (1113)
- Your Second Brain isn’t just a tool—it’s an environment. (1117)
- The next step in building your Second Brain is to take the morsels of insight you’ve begun to capture and organize them in a space where you can do your best thinking. (1124)

### Organizing for Action: Where 99 Percent of Notetakers Get Stuck (And How to Solve It) (1125)

- I eventually named this organizing system PARA,I which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose. (1141)
- PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is. (1145)
- If there isn’t a current project that your note would be useful for, we have a couple of other options of where to put it, including dedicated places for each of the main “areas” of your life that you are responsible for, and “resources,” which is like a personal library of references, facts, and inspiration. (1159)
- Over time, as you complete your projects, master new skills, and progress toward your goals, you’ll discover that some notes and resources are no longer actionable. I’ll show you how to move them to your “archives” to keep them out of sight but within easy reach. (1161)
- We need to always be wary of accumulating so much information that we spend all our time managing it, instead of putting it to use in the outside world. (1168)
- The intention here is not to use a single software program, but to use a single organizing system, one that provides consistency even as you switch between apps many times per day. (1173)
- By structuring your notes and files around the completion of your active projects, your knowledge can go to work for you, instead of collecting dust like an “idea graveyard.” (1175)

###  How PARA Works: Priming Your Mind (and Notes) for Action (1179)

-  Projects: What I’m Working on Right Now (1185)
  - Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a specific period of time and then they finish. Second, they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.” (1186)
  - Knowing which projects you’re currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren’t important. (1202)
- Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time (1203)
  - Activities or places you are responsible for: Home/apartment; Cooking; Travel; Car. People you are responsible for or accountable to: Friends; Kids; Spouse; Pets. Standards of performance you are responsible for: Health; Personal growth; Friendships; Finances. (1219)
  - your job or business: Departments or functions you are responsible for: Account management; Marketing; Operations; Product development. People or teams you are responsible for or accountable to: Direct reports; Manager; Board of directors; Suppliers. Standards of performance you are responsible for: Professional development; Sales and marketing; Relationships and networking; Recruiting and hiring. (1221)
  - Even though areas have no final outcome, it is still important to manage them. (1226)
  - While there is no goal to reach, there is a standard that you want to uphold in each of these areas. (1227)
  - Only you can decide what those standards are. For our purposes, it helps tremendously to have a place dedicated to each of them. That way you always have somewhere to put any thought, reflection, idea, or useful tidbit of information relevant to each important aspect of your life. (1230)
- Resources: Things I Want to Reference in the Future (1233)
  - This is basically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about. (1234)
  - You can also think of them as “research” or “reference materials.” They are trends you are keeping track of, ideas related to your job or industry, hobbies and side interests, and things you’re merely curious about. (1240)
  - Any note or file that isn’t relevant or actionable for a current project or area can be placed into resources for future reference. (1243)
- Archives: Things I’ve Completed or Put on Hold (1244)
  - This includes any item from the previous three categories that is no longer active. (1245)
  - Projects that are completed or canceled Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining (such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment) Resources that are no longer relevant (hobbies you lose interest in or subjects you no longer care about) (1246)

### What PARA Looks Like: A Behind-the-Scenes Snapshot (1253)

- Here’s an example of what the folders in my notes app look like with PARA: (1256)
- Inside each of these top-level folders, I have individual folders for the specific projects, areas, resources, and archives that make up my life. (1258)
- Inside these folders live the actual notes that contain my ideas. (1260)
- The number of active projects usually ranges from five to fifteen for the average person. (1261)
- That’s it—just three levels of hierarchy to encompass the thousands of notes I’ve accumulated over the years: the top-level PARA categories, the project folder, and the notes themselves. (1267)

### Where Do I Put This?—How to Decide Where to Save Individual Notes (1284)

- The temptation when initially capturing notes is to also try to decide where they should go and what they mean. (1288)
- Here’s the problem: the moment you first capture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to. (1288)
- First, because you’ve just encountered it and haven’t had any time to ponder its ultimate purpose, but more importantly, because forcing yourself to make decisions every time you capture something adds a lot of friction to the process. This makes the experience mentally taxing and thus less likely to happen in the first place. (1289)
- This is why it’s so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: “keeping what resonates” in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. (1292)
- Most notes apps have an “inbox” or “daily notes” section where new notes you’ve captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide where they belong. (1293)
- Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA comes into play. (1297)
- The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible: (1297)
- In which project will this be most useful? If none: In which area will this be most useful? If none: Which resource does this belong to? If none: Place in archives. (1303)
- In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest. (1306)
- Organizing by actionability counteracts our tendency to constantly procrastinate and postpone our aspirations to some far-off future. PARA pulls these distant dreams into the here and now, by helping us see that we already have a lot of the information we need to get started. (1312)

###  Organizing Information Like a Kitchen—What Am I Making? (1316)

- Everything in a kitchen is designed and organized to support an outcome—preparing a meal as efficiently as possible. (1317)
- Imagine how absurd it would be to organize a kitchen instead by kind of food: fresh fruit, dried fruit, fruit juice, and frozen fruit would all be stored in the same place, just because they all happen to be made of fruit. (1323)
- Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend organizing them according to where they are going—specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize. (1326)
- PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. (1329)

### Completed Projects Are the Oxygen of Your Second Brain (1344)

- Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go. (1345)
- They had repeatedly postponed their creative ambitions to some far-off, mythical time when somehow everything would be perfectly in order. Once we set that aside and just focused on what they actually wanted to do right now, they suddenly gained a tremendous sense of clarity and motivation. (1366)
- I’ve learned that completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second Brain. (1382)
- It is only the steady completion of tangible wins that can infuse you with a sense of determination, momentum, and accomplishment. (1384)

### Your Turn: Move Quickly, Touch Lightly (1386)

- My mentor advised me to “move quickly and touch lightly” instead. To look for the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. (1392)
- When it comes to PARA, that step is generally to create folders for each of your active projects in your notes app and begin to fill them with the content related to those projects. Once you have a home for something, you tend to find more of it. (1394)
- Start by asking yourself, “What projects am I currently committed to moving forward?” and then create a new project folder for each one. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you think of the projects that might be on your plate: (1396)
- Notice what’s on your mind: What’s worrying you that you haven’t taken the time to identify as a project? What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on? (1398)
- Look at your calendar: What do you need to follow up on from the past? What needs planning and preparation for the future? (1399)
- Look at your to-do list: What actions are you already taking that are actually part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified? What communication or follow-up actions you’ve scheduled with people are actually part of a bigger project? (1401)
- Look at your computer desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, bookmarks, emails, or open browser tabs: What are you keeping around because it is part of a larger project? (1403)
- You could also create folders for your areas and resources, but I recommend starting only with projects to avoid creating lots of empty containers. (1410)
- Practice capturing new notes, organizing them into folders, and moving them from one folder to another. Each time you finish a project, move its folder wholesale to the archives, and each time you start a new project, look through your archives to see if any past project might have assets you can reuse. (1413)
- As you create these folders and move notes into them, don’t worry about reorganizing or “cleaning up” any existing notes. (1416)
- If you ever need them, they’ll show up in searches and remain just as you left them. (1418)
- Your goal is to clear your virtual workspace and gather all the items related to each active project in one place. Once you do, you’ll gain the confidence and clarity to take action on those ideas, rather than letting them pile up with no end in sight. (1419)

## Chapter 6: Distill—Find the Essence (1432)

### Quantum Notetaking: How to Create Notes for an Unknown Future (1479)

- When you initially capture a note, you may have only seconds to get it into your Second Brain before the next meeting, urgent task, or crying child comes calling. (1483)
- This is why we separate capturing and organizing from the subsequent steps: you need to be able to store something quickly and save any future refinement for later. (1486)
- Your job as a notetaker is to preserve the notes you’re taking on the things you discover in such a way that they can survive the journey into the future. That way your excitement and enthusiasm for your knowledge builds over time instead of fading away. (1500)

### Discoverability—The Missing Link in Making Notes Useful (1502)

- To enhance the discoverability of your notes, we can turn to a simple habit you probably remember from school: highlighting the most important points. (1510)
- What do you do when communicating with a very busy, very impatient, very important person? You distill your message down to the key points and action steps. (1521)

### Highlighting 2.0: The Progressive Summarization Technique (1528)

- The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart. (1533)
- This is what I call “layer one”—the chunks of text initially captured in my notes. Notice that I didn’t save the entire article—only a few key excerpts. (1542)
- To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation. I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or weekends, when I come across the note while working on other projects, or when I don’t have the energy for more focused work. All I have to do is bold the main points within the note. (1549)
- We’re not done yet! For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting. I advise using the “highlighting” feature offered by most notes apps, which paints passages in bright yellow just like the fluorescent highlighters we used in school (which appear in light gray below). If your notes app doesn’t have a highlighting feature, you can use underlining or another kind of formatting instead. Look only at the bolded passages you identified in layer two and highlight only the most interesting and surprising of those points. This will often amount to just one or two sentences that encapsulate the message of the original source. (1557)
- There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words. The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of my thinking. Looking only at the points I’ve previously bolded and highlighted in layers two and three makes it far easier to write this summary than if I was trying to summarize the entire article all at once. (1567)
- I recommend using bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive summary succinct. Use your own words, define any unusual terms you’re using, and think about how your future self, who may not remember anything about this source, might interpret what you’re writing. (1572)
- By reviewing this executive summary, I can rapidly recall the main takeaways from this article in a fraction of the time it would take to reread the original. Since the takeaways are already in my own words, they are easy to incorporate into whatever I’m working on. (1575)

### Zooming In and Out of Your Map of Knowledge (1578)

- You can customize how much attention you spend on a note based on your energy level and time available. (1583)
- With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas found in your Second Brain. (1589)
- You are building this map without moving anything or deleting anything. Every sentence gets left right where you found it, giving you the freedom to leave things out without worrying that you’ll lose them. (1590)
- The multiple layers of Progressive Summarization are like a safety net; if you go in the wrong direction, or make a mistake, you can always just go back to the original version and try again. Nothing gets forgotten or deleted. (1594)
- Progressive Summarization helps you focus on the content and the presentation of your notes,IV instead of spending too much time on labeling, tagging, linking, or other advanced features offered by many information management tools. (1596)
- Progressive Summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible—it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. (1687)

### The Three Most Common Mistakes of Novice Notetakers (1692)

- Mistake #1: Over-Highlighting (1694)
  - Remember that notes are not authoritative texts. (1700)
  - You will always be able to go back and review the full, original source if needed. Your notes only solve the problem of rediscovering those sources when you need them. (1702)
  - A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer. (1703)
- Mistake #2: Highlighting Without a Purpose in Mind (1706)
  - The most common question I hear about Progressive Summarization is “When should I be doing this highlighting?” The answer is that you should do it when you’re getting ready to create something. (1707)
  - If you try to do it with every note up front, you’ll quickly be mired in hours of meticulous highlighting with no clear purpose in mind. (1709)
  - The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future selfVII—by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it. This (1719)
- Mistake #3: Making Highlighting Difficult (1723)
  - Don’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it. (1723)
  - Just as you listened for a feeling of internal resonance in deciding what content to save in the first place, the same rule applies for the insights within the note. (1726)

### Your Turn: Keep Your Future Self in Mind (1737)

- If you can’t locate a piece of information quickly, in a format that’s convenient and ready to be put to use, then you might as well not have it at all. (1739)
- Start by saving only the best excerpts from that piece of content in a new note, either using copy-paste or a capture tool. (1748)
- Next, read through the excerpts, bolding the main points and most important takeaways. (1749)
- Now read through only the bolded passages, and highlight (or, if your notes app doesn’t have a highlighting feature, underline) the best of the best passages. (1751)
- The true test of whether a note you’ve created is discoverable is whether you can get the gist of it at a glance. (1754)
- Each time you decide to add a highlight, you are developing your judgment: distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don’t. (1757)

## Chapter 7: Express—Show Your Work (1792)

### How to Protect Your Most Precious Resource (1856)

- The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. (1859)
- The challenge we face in building a Second Brain is how to establish a system for personal knowledge that frees up attention, instead of taking more of it. (1862)
- there is a flaw in focusing only on the final results: all the intermediate work—the notes, the drafts, the outlines, the feedback—tends to be underappreciated and undervalued. (1866)
- If we consider the focused application of our attention to be our greatest asset as knowledge workers, we can no longer afford to let that intermediate work disappear. (1869)
- The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know. (1875)

### Intermediate Packets: The Power of Thinking Small (1878)

- Here’s what most people miss: it’s not enough to simply divide tasks into smaller pieces—you then need a system for managing those pieces. (1886)
- Intermediate Packets are the concrete, individual building blocks that make up your work. (1888)
- Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something interesting. (1896)
- Our time and attention are scarce, and it’s time we treated the things we invest in—reports, deliverables, plans, pieces of writing, graphics, slides—as knowledge assets that can be reused instead of reproducing them from scratch. Reusing Intermediate Packets of work frees up our attention for higher-order, more creative thinking. (1899)
- There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work: (1902)
  - Distilled notes: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain (using the Progressive Summarization technique you learned in the previous chapter, for example). (1903)
  - Outtakes: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones. (1905)
  - Work-in-process: The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects. (1906)
  - Final deliverables: Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new. (1906)
  - Documents created by others: Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work. (1908)
- Making the shift to working in terms of Intermediate Packets unlocks several very powerful benefits. (1917)
  - First, you’ll become interruption-proof because you are focusing only on one small packet at a time, instead of trying to load up the entire project into your mind at once. (1918)
  - Second, you’ll be able to make progress in any span of time. (1920)
  - Third, Intermediate Packets increase the quality of your work by allowing you to collect feedback more often. (1924)
  - Fourth, and best of all, eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. (1927)
- By “thinking small,” you can focus on creating just one IP each time you sit down to work, without worrying about how viable it is or whether it will be used in the exact way you envisioned. (1934)

### Assembling Building Blocks: The Secret to Frictionless Output (1937)

- While you can sit down to purposefully create an IP, it is far more powerful to simply notice the IPs that you have already produced and then to take an extra moment to save them in your Second Brain. (1946)
- Ask yourself: How could you acquire or assemble each of these components, instead of having to make them yourself? (1955)
- Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our ideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want to make. (1960)
- Once we’ve completed these initial steps, expression transforms from a gut-wrenching, agonizing feat to a straightforward assembly of existing packets of work. (1966)

### How to Resurface and Reuse Your Past Work (1973)

- These are some of the most valuable connections—when an idea crosses the boundaries between subjects. They can’t be planned or predicted. They can emerge only when many kinds of ideas in different shapes and sizes are mixed together. (1980)
- This inherent unpredictability means that there is no single, perfectly reliable retrieval system for the ideas contained in your notes. Instead, there are four methods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another. (1981)
- You can step through them in order until you find what you’re looking for. (1984)
- Retrieval Method #1: Search (1987)
  - Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to. It is most useful when you already know more or less what you’re looking for, when you don’t have notes saved in a preexisting folder, or when you’re looking for text, but as with every tool, it has its limitations. (1993)
- Retrieval Method #2: Browsing (1997)
  - Each of these folders is a dedicated environment designed specifically for focusing on that domain of your life. (1999)
  - Browsing allows us to gradually home in on the information we are looking for, starting with the general and getting more and more specific. (2006)
- Retrieval Method #3: Tags (2016)
  - I don’t recommend using tags as your primary organizational system. It takes far too much energy to apply tags to every single note compared to the ease of searching with keywords or browsing your folders. However, tags can come in handy in specific situations when the two previous retrieval methods aren’t up to the task, and you want to spontaneously gather, connect, and synthesize groups of notes on the fly. (2028)
- Retrieval Method #4: Serendipity (2032)
  - There is no way to plan for them, but that doesn’t mean we can’t create the ideal conditions for them to arise. This is the main reason we put all sorts of different kinds of material, on many subjects and in diverse formats, all jumbled together in our Second Brain. (2035)
  - Serendipity takes a few different forms when it comes to retrieval. (2038)
  - First, while using the previous retrieval methods, it is a good idea to keep your focus a little broad. Don’t begin and end your search with only the specific folder that matches your criteria. Make sure to look through related categories, such as similar projects, relevant areas, and different kinds of resources. (2039)
  - Second, serendipity is amplified by visual patterns. This is why I strongly suggest saving not only text notes but images as well (which is difficult to do in other kinds of software such as word processors). (2045)
  - We intuitively absorb colors and shapes in the blink of an eye, using far less energy than it takes to read words. (2047)
  - Third, sharing our ideas with others introduces a major element of serendipity. When you present an idea to another person, their reaction is inherently unpredictable. (2049)

### Creativity Is Inherently Collaborative (2095)

- Reframing your work in terms of Intermediate Packets isn’t just about doing the same old stuff in smaller chunks. That doesn’t unlock your true potential. The transformation comes from the fact that smaller chunks are inherently more shareable and collaborative. (2101)
- It’s less confronting to hear criticism on one small aspect of your work, at an early stage when you still have time to correct it, than getting a negative reaction after months of effort. (2104)
- Once you understand how incredibly valuable feedback is, you start to crave as much of it as you can find. (2109)
- You will begin to see yourself as the curator of the collective thinking of your network, rather than the sole originator of ideas. (2112)

### Everything Is a Remix (2118)

- Don’t take the work of others wholesale; borrow aspects or parts of their work. (2127)
- Of course, cite all your sources and influences, even if you don’t strictly have to. (2129)
- Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets is a major step toward this turning point. Instead of thinking of your job in terms of tasks, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble. (2134)
- As the potential of your intellectual assets becomes apparent, you’ll start to look for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks whenever possible. (2136)

### Your Turn: You Only Know What You Make (2143)

- what matters is that you are finding your voice and insisting that what you have to say matters. You have to value your ideas enough to share them. You have to believe that the smallest idea has the potential to change people’s lives. (2156)

## PART THREE The Shift Making Things Happen (2176)

## Chapter 8: The Art of Creative Execution (2180)

- We can’t expect ourselves to instantly come up with brilliant ideas on demand. I learned that innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas to the surface of our awareness. (2202)
- Building a Second Brain is really about standardizing the way we work, because we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something. (2206)

### Divergence and Convergence: A Creative Balancing Act (2220)

- The first two steps of CODE, Capture and Organize, make up divergence. They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. (2247)
- The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence. They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we’ve assembled. (2248)
- The Three Strategies I Use to Bring Creative Work Together (2250)
- Your Second Brain is a powerful ally in overcoming the universal challenge of creative work—sitting down to make progress and having no idea where to start. (2251)
- When you distinguish between the two modes of divergence and convergence, you can decide each time you begin to work which mode you want to be in, which gives you the answers to the questions above. (2254)
- In divergence mode, you want to open up your horizons and explore every possible option. Open the windows and doors, click every link, jump from one source to another, and let your curiosity be your guide for what to do next. (2255)
- If you decide to enter convergence mode, do the opposite: close the door, put on noise-canceling headphones, ignore every new input, and ferociously chase the sweet reward of completion. (2257)
- Of the two stages of this process, convergence is where most people struggle. (2259)

### 1. The Archipelago of Ideas: Give Yourself Stepping-Stones (2270)

- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is valuable any time you are starting a new piece of work—whether it’s a how-to guide, a training workshop, a brief for a new project, or an essay you’re publishing on your blog. (2271)
- To create an Archipelago of Ideas, you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense. (2281)
- Below each source, I’ve copied and pasted only the points I specifically want to use in this particular piece of writing. (2289)
- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining—laying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together. (2293)
- An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: choosing ideas (known as selection) and arranging them into a logical flow (known as sequencing). (2305)
- The goal of an archipelago is that instead of sitting down to a blank page or screen and stressing out about where to begin, you start with a series of small stepping-stones to guide your efforts. First you select the points and ideas you want to include in your outline, and then in a separate step, you rearrange and sequence them into an order that flows logically. (2309)

### 2. The Hemingway Bridge: Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today (2314)

- Besides his prolific works, Hemingway was known for a particular writing strategy, which I call the “Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear. (2316)
- How do you create a Hemingway Bridge? Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes: (2325)
- Write down ideas for next steps: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one. (2327)
- Write down the current status: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect. (2328)
- Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing. (2329)
- Write out your intention for the next work session: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach. (2331)
- To take this strategy a step further, there is one more thing you can do as you wrap up the day’s work: send off your draft or beta or proposal for feedback. (2336)

### 3. Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete (2340)

- Your Second Brain is a crucial part of this strategy, because you need a place to save the parts that get postponed or removed. (2367)
- One of the best uses for a Second Brain is to collect and save the scraps on the cutting-room floor in case they can be used elsewhere. (2370)
- Knowing that nothing I write or create truly gets lost—only saved for later use—gives me the confidence to aggressively cut my creative works down to size without fearing that I’ve wasted effort or that I’ll lose the results of my thinking forever. (2374)
- Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time. (2378)
- Divergence and convergence are not a linear path, but a loop: once you complete one round of convergence, you can take what you’ve learned right back into a new cycle of divergence. (2390)

### Your Turn: Move Fast and Make Things (2421)

- Start by picking one project you want to move forward on. It could be one you identified in Chapter 5, when I asked you to make folders for each active project. It could alternatively be something you know you want to (or have to) get started on. The more uncertain, new, or challenging the project, the better. (2422)
- Make an outline with your goals, intentions, questions, and considerations for the project. (2424)
- Here are some useful questions to ask as you conduct your search: Is there a book or article you could extract some excerpts from as inspiration? Are there websites that might have resources you could build upon? Are there podcasts by experts you could subscribe to and listen to while commuting or doing household chores? Are there relevant IPs buried in other projects you’ve worked on in the past? (2427)
- Move all the notes and IPs you might want to use into a new project folder. (2433)
- Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project using only the notes you’ve gathered in front of you. (2434)
- This first pass could be a plan, an agenda, a proposal, a diagram, or some other format that turns your ideas into a tangible artifact. (2436)
- If you find that you can’t complete the first iteration in one sitting, start by building a Hemingway Bridge to the next time you can work on it. (2441)
- If you feel resistance to continuing with this project later, try Dialing Down the Scope. (2445)
- Throughout every step of this process, be sure to keep notes on anything you learn or discover, or any new Intermediate Packets you might want to seek out. (2447)

## Chapter 9: The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers (2461)

- Your Second Brain is a practical system for enhancing your productivity and your creativity. While these domains are often seen as mutually exclusive opposites—one concrete and defined; the other abstract and open-ended—instead I see them as complementary. (2465)
- This balance between order and creativity is something that we can build into our Second Brain intentionally. (2469)
- Being organized is a habit—a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with, and put information to use. (2473)

### The Mise-en-Place Way to Sustainable Productivity (2476)

- For us as well, the only time we have available to maintain our systems is during the execution of our regular work. (2492)
- It’s not enough to have inner discipline. We also need to follow an outer discipline—a system of principles and behaviors—to channel our energies, thoughts, and emotions productively. (2499)
- In this chapter, I will introduce you to three kinds of habits that can be integrated into your routine to ensure your Second Brain remains functional and relevant. (2501)
- You can think of these habits as the “maintenance schedule” of your Second Brain. Just like you have a maintenance schedule for your car, which advises you to regularly change the oil, rotate the tires, and change the air filters, your Second Brain occasionally needs a tune-up to ensure it’s in good working order. (2508)
- The Project Checklist Habit: The Key to Starting Your Knowledge Flywheel (2511)
- At the most basic level, knowledge work is about taking in information and then turning it into results. (2512)
- What most people are missing, however, is a feedback loop—a way to “recycle” the knowledge that was created as part of past efforts so it can be used in future ones as well. (2515)
- If you look closely, there are two key moments in this process of recycling knowledge. Two places where the paths diverge, and you have the chance to do something different than you’ve done before. Those two moments are when a project starts, and when it finishes. (2522)

### Checklist #1: Project Kickoff (2526)

- 1. Capture my current thinking on the project. (2538)
  - I like to start by creating a blank note and doing a brainstorm of any thoughts that come to mind. This first note is then placed inside a new project folder dedicated to storing all the notes I’ll be creating related to it. (2539)
  - Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm: What do I already know about this project? What don’t I know that I need to find out? What is my goal or intention? Who can I talk to who might provide insights? What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? (2542)
- 2. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes. (2548)
- 3. Search for related terms across all folders. (2553)
  - This is where the Curator’s Perspective I used when I first captured the content really pays off—because each and every note in my Second Brain was deliberately chosen, I am able to search through a collection of exclusively high-quality notes free of fluff and filler. (2555)
- 4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. (2561)
  - The important thing isn’t where a note is located, but whether you can reference it quickly while staying focused on the project at hand. (2563)
- 5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project. (2565)
  - My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to formulate a logical progression of steps that make it clear what I should do next. (2566)
- The important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that you are making a plan for how to tackle the project, not executing the project itself. (2571)
- encourage you to use my kickoff checklist as a starting point and customize it over time as you understand how it fits into your own context. (2575)
- Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version: (2577)
  - Answer premortem questions: What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail? (2578)
  - Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters. (2580)
  - Define success criteria: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for? (2581)
  - Have an official kickoff: Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and timeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them. I find that doing an official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project! (2583)

### Checklist #2: Project Completion (2586)

- This is where the Project Completion Checklist is essential. It’s a series of steps you can take to decide if there are any reusable knowledge assets worth keeping, before archiving the rest. (2592)
- 1. Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app. (2599)
- 2. Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section. (2604)
  - Each project I work on usually has a corresponding goal. I keep all my goals in a single digital note, sorted from short-term goals for the next year to long-term goals for years to come. (2605)
  - like to take a moment and reflect on whether the goal I initially set for this project panned out. (2606)
  - I also like to cross out the goal and move it to a different section called “Completed.” Any time I need some motivation, I can look through this list and be reminded of all the meaningful goals I’ve achieved in the past. (2610)
- 3. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders. (2613)
  - It takes a certain lens to see each of these documents and files not as disposable, but as tangible by-products of quality thinking. (2616)
  - Any IPs I decide could be relevant to another project, I move to that project’s folder. The same goes for notes relevant to areas or resources. This is a forgiving decision, and it’s okay if you don’t catch every single one. (2618)
- 4. Move project to archives across all platforms. (2621)
  - This move ensures that your list of active projects doesn’t get cluttered with old, obsolete stuff from the past while also preserving every bit of material just in case it unexpectedly becomes relevant in the future. (2624)
- 5. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving. (2625)
  - The fifth step applies only if the project is getting canceled, postponed, or put on hold instead of completed. (2626)
  - I add a new note to the project folder titled “Current status,” and jot down a few comments so I can pick it back up in the future. (2628)
  - This Hemingway Bridge gives me the confidence to put the project on ice knowing I can bring it back to life anytime. (2630)
- Here are some other items you can include on your Project Completion Checklist. I encourage you to personalize it for your own needs: (2634)
  - Answer postmortem questions: What did you learn? What did you do well? What could you have done better? What can you improve for next time? (2636)
  - Communicate with stakeholders: Notify your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., that the project is complete and what the outcomes were. (2637)
  - Evaluate success criteria: Were the objectives of the project achieved? Why or why not? What was the return on investment? (2639)
  - Officially close out the project and celebrate: Send any last emails, invoices, receipts, feedback forms, or documents, and celebrate your accomplishments with your team or collaborators so you receive the feeling of fulfillment for all the effort you put (2640)
  - The purpose of using project checklists isn’t to make the way you work rigid and formulaic. It is to help you start and finish projects cleanly and decisively, so you don’t have “orphaned” commitments that linger on with no end in sight. Think of these checklists as scaffolding—a supporting structure that ensures what you’re building can stand on its own. (2646)

### The Review Habit: Why You Should Batch Process Your Notes (and How Often) (2651)

- Allen recommends using a Weekly Review to write down any new to-dos, review your active projects, and decide on priorities for the upcoming week. (2655)
- I suggest adding one more step: review the notes you’ve created over the past week, give them succinct titles that tell you what’s inside, and sort them into the appropriate PARA folders. Most notes apps have an “inbox” of some kind where new notes collect until they’re ready to be reviewed. (2656)

### A Weekly Review Template: Reset to Avoid Overwhelm (2660)

- Here is my own Weekly Review Checklist, which I usually complete every three to seven days depending on how busy a given week is. (2661)
- 1. Clear my email inbox. (2667)
- 2. Check my calendar. (2670)
  - I typically look at the last couple of weeks in case there’s anything I need to follow up on, and the upcoming couple of weeks in case there’s anything I need to prepare for. (2671)
- 3. Clear my computer desktop. (2674)
- 4. Clear my notes inbox. (2677)
  - By the time I get to the fourth step, the inbox in my notes app is chock-full of interesting tidbits from the previous three steps—from my email, calendar, and computer desktop. Plus all the other notes I’ve collected over the course of the preceding week, which usually totals between five and fifteen new notes in an average week. (2677)
  - At this point I’ll batch process them all at once, making quick, intuitive decisions about which of the PARA folders each note might be relevant to, and creating new folders as needed. (2680)
  - You’ll notice that this is the only step in my Weekly Review that is directly related to my digital notes. It is a simple and practical process of going through my notes inbox, giving each note an informative title, and moving them into the appropriate PARA folders. (2682)
- 5. Choose my tasks for the week. (2688)
  - It’s time to clear the inbox in my task manager app. (2688)
  - The final step of my Weekly Review is to select the tasks I’m committing to for the upcoming week. Because I’ve just completed a sweep of my entire digital world and taken into account every piece of potentially relevant information, I can make this decision decisively and begin my week with total confidence that I’m working on the right things. (2691)

### A Monthly Review Template: Reflect for Clarity and Control (2693)

- I recommend doing a Monthly Review that is a bit more reflective and holistic. It’s a chance to evaluate the big picture and consider more fundamental changes to your goals, priorities, and systems that you might not have the chance to think about in the busyness of the day-to-day. (2694)
- 1. Review and update my goals. (2699)
  - I start by reviewing my goals for the quarter and the year. (2700)
- 2. Review and update my project list. (2703)
  - It’s important that the project list remains a current, timely, and accurate reflection of your real-life goals and priorities. (2705)
- 3. Review my areas of responsibility. (2707)
  - I’ll think about the major areas of my life, such as my health, finances, relationships, and home life, and decide if there’s anything I want to change or take action on. (2708)
  - Area notebooks often contain notes that become the seeds of future projects. (2710)
- 4. Review someday/maybe tasks. (2713)
- 5. Reprioritize tasks. (2719)

### The Noticing Habits: Using Your Second Brain to Engineer Luck (2722)

- I call them “noticing” habits—taking advantage of small opportunities you notice to capture something you might otherwise skip over or to make a note more actionable or discoverable. (2724)
- Noticing that an idea you have in mind could potentially be valuable and capturing it instead of thinking, “Oh, it’s nothing.” (2726)
- Noticing when an idea you’re reading about resonates with you and taking those extra few seconds to highlight it. (2727)
- Noticing that a note could use a better title—and changing it so it’s easier for your future self to find it. (2728)
- Noticing you could move or link a note to another project or area where it will be more useful. (2730)
- Noticing opportunities to combine two or more Intermediate Packets into a new, larger work so you don’t have to start it from scratch. (2730)
- Noticing a chance to merge similar content from different notes into the same note so it’s not spread around too many places. (2732)
- Noticing when an IP that you already have could help someone else solve a problem, and sharing it with them, even if it’s not perfect. (2733)
- The nice thing about notes, unlike to-dos, is that they aren’t urgent. (2734)
- If you have the time to organize your notes each week, that’s great. If you don’t, it’s no problem. I often will wait weeks or even a month or longer before I find the time to clear my notes inbox. They remain ready and waiting there for as long as I need. (2736)
- It’s crucial to stay organized, but it needs to be done a little at a time in the flow of our normal lives. It needs to be done in the in-between moments of moving your projects forward as you notice small opportunities for improvement. (2744)
- When you make your digital notes a working environment, not just a storage environment, you end up spending a lot more time there. When you spend more time there, you’ll inevitably notice many more small opportunities for change than you expect. Over time, this will gradually produce an environment far more suited to your real needs than anything you could have planned up front. (2756)

### Your Turn: A Perfect System You Don’t Use Isn’t Perfect (2760)

- To make this concrete: There’s no need to capture every idea; the best ones will always come back around eventually. There’s no need to clear your inbox frequently; unlike your to-do list, there’s no negative consequence if you miss a given note. There’s no need to review or summarize notes on a strict timeline; we’re not trying to memorize their contents or keep them top of mind. When organizing notes or files within PARA, it’s a very forgiving decision of where to put something, since search is so effective as a backup option. (2771)
- The truth is, any system that must be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed. (2776)
- We have to remember that we are not building an encyclopedia of immaculately organized knowledge. We are building a working system. (2778)

## Chapter 10: The Path of Self-Expression (2790)

### Mindset Over Toolset—The Quest for the Perfect App (2804)

- You learned to react in a certain way when faced with new ideas. You adopted a default “blueprint” for how you treated incoming information—with anticipation, fear, excitement, self-doubt, or some complex mix of feelings that is unique to you. That default attitude to information colors every aspect of your life. (2814)

### The Fear Our Minds Can’t Do Enough (2824)

- This is the basic choice we have in creating our own experience—which aspects to nourish or starve, using only the magnifying power of our attention. (2846)
- Your mind will become calmer, knowing that every idea is being tracked. It will become more focused, knowing it can put thoughts on hold and access them later. (2848)

### Giving Your First Brain a New Job (2852)

- it’s time to fire your biological brain from that job and give it a new one: as the CEO of your life, orchestrating and managing the process of turning information into results. (2853)
- Once your biology is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, you’ll be free to expand the flow of information as much as you want without drowning in it. (2858)
- You’ll become a curator of perspectives, free to pick and choose the beliefs and concepts that serve you best in any given situation. (2863)

### The Shift from Scarcity to Abundance (2873)
- The biggest shift that starts to occur as soon as you start creating a Second Brain is the shift from viewing the world through the lens of scarcity to seeing it through the lens of abundance. (2874)
- The paradox of hoarding is that no matter how much we collect and accumulate, it’s never enough. (2885)
- An Abundance Mindset tells us that there is an endless amount of incredibly powerful knowledge everywhere we look—in the content we consume, in our social network, in our bodies and intuitions, and in our own minds. It also tells us that we don’t need to consume or understand all of it, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most need tend to continually find us again and again. (2888)

### The Shift from Obligation to Service (2898)

- Your Second Brain starts as a system to support you and your goals, but from there it can just as easily be used to support others and their dreams. You have everything you need to give back and be a force for good in the world. (2919)

### The Shift from Consuming to Creating (2922)

- “Polanyi’s Paradox.” It can be summarized as “We know more than we can say.” (2927)
- As you build your Second Brain, you will collect many facts and figures, but they are just a means to an end: discovering the tacit knowledge that lives within you. (2935)

### Our Fundamental Need for Self-Expression (2947)

### Your Turn: The Courage to Share (2968)

- They think maybe one day they’ll get around to sharing them. I’m here to tell you that there is no reason to wait. The world is desperate to hear what you know. (2970)

### Final Thoughts: You Can Do This (2982)

- There is no single right way to build a Second Brain. (2982)
- As your needs change, give yourself the freedom to discard or take on whichever parts serve you. (2985)
- If at any point you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and focus on what is immediately necessary: your most important projects and priorities. Scale back to only the notes you need to move those priorities forward. (2993)
- Instead of trying to architect your entire Second Brain system from scratch up front, focus on moving one project at a time through each step from capturing to expressing. (2994)
- You can also simplify things by focusing on just one stage of building your Second Brain. (2996)
- As you begin your journey, here are twelve practical steps you can take right now to get your Second Brain started. (3002)
  - Decide what you want to capture. (3005)
  - Choose your notes app. (3007)
  - Choose a capture tool. (3009)
  - Get set up with PARA. (3011)
  - Get inspired by identifying your twelve favorite problems. (3013)
  - Automatically capture your ebook highlights. (3016)
  - Practice Progressive Summarization. (3018)
  - Experiment with just one Intermediate Packet. (3020)
  - Make progress on one deliverable. (3023)
  - Schedule a Weekly Review. (3025)
  - Assess your notetaking proficiency. (3028)
  - Join the PKM community. (3030)
- While building a Second Brain is a project—something you can commit to and achieve within a reasonable period of time—using your Second Brain is a lifelong practice. (3034)
- If I could leave you with one last bit of advice, it is to chase what excites you. (3043)
- Those are the moments that are truly precious, and that no technology can produce for you. Run after your obsessions with everything you have. Just be sure to take notes along the way. (3044)

## Chapter 11: How to Creat a Tagging System That Works

### The Problem with Tagging

- There is no such universal taxonomy of knowledge, and any effort dedicated toward that goal will only lead to frustration.
- While tags seem useful on the surface, the most common way I see people using them - tagging every note as it's being created with every topic it might relate to - has serious flaws.
- The problem with this approach is that it requires you to spend a lot of energy upfront making a series of mentally taxing decisions before you even know whether and how a note will be used.
- Ultimately, tagging shuold facilitate effective action, not just abstract thought.
- I propose an entirely different use for tags for modern knowledge work, to track the progress of your notes.
- Tagging Is an Advanced Technique - For that reason, I recommend waiting until you've captured hundreds of notes and used them to complete multiple projects before even attempting to use tags. I encourage you to start small, stick with the simpler PARA folders for as long as possible, and focus your effort for now on turning the notes you've captured into tangible outputs.

### Three Actionable Approaches to Tagging

- 1. Create personalied tags for your use cases.
  - Similarly, if you already know how your notes are likely to be used - such as for citations in a paper [Source], as evidence in a trial [Evidence], or as slides in a presentation [Slides] - it can be helpful to tag your notes according to those use cases.
  - Ask yourself, "What are the most common use cases for the content I capture? Here are a couple common examples:
    - Tagging according to the final product a note will be used in: [Presentation], [Essay], [Report], [Website], [Project plan], [Meeting agenda], or [Budget].
    - Tagging according to the kind of information a note contains: [Arguments], [Theories], [Frameworks], [Evidence], [Claim], [Counterpoint], or [Question].
- 2. Use tags to track the progress of notes.
  - Here are a couple of examples of how I've seen people successfully use tags to track the progress of their notes:
    - Tagging according to its role in a project: [Meeting notes], [Timeline], [Budget], [Decision], [Action], [Idea], or [Objective]
    - Tagging according to the current stage of their workflow: [Planned], [In process], [Waiting for approval], [Reviewed], [Approved], [On hold], or [Finished]
- 3. Tag notes retroactively and only as needed.
  - This is the perfect situation for tags: when you want a different way of "viewing" your notes, without having to undertake a massive reorganization of your entire system. In this way, tags provide an alternative lens through which you can view your knowledge and expertise.
  - You would think adding structure to your notes after the fact would be harder, but in fact it's easier. Instead of trying to predict your future needs in advance, you can simply look at what you've already collected and pick the groupings that seem to emerge organically.
  - Instead of applying tags when you first capture content, I recommend applying them when it's time to use it.

### The Benefits of Actionable Tagging

- It allows you to jump into new projects much faster.
- This ensures you are spending as much of your time as possible directly engaging with the subject matter of your learning, rather than wasting time trying to create the "perfect" system upfront.
- Best of all, using tags in this way means it's perfectly fine to skip adding tags altogether if you don't feel like it. Since tags are not your primary way of organizing, your ideas won't fall through the cracks if you don't have the time or energy to apply tags to a given note.
