# Playbook for Strategic Foresight and Innovation

## Five Planning Phases

Five Planning Phases give a POSTV path to the future.

* __Perspective__ - Understand what has come before, focus on long-term strategy, 3-5 R&D cycles out.
* __Opportunity__ - Find growth opportunities today and into the future.
* __Solution__ - Define path to innovation, prototype and understand what must be built.
* __Team__ - Find partners and teams members to coordinate and support execution.
* __Vision__ - Develop vision to guide team action toward success.

## Ambiguity Curve

Planning phases may vary from one another, but all are defined by diminishing ambiguity over time.

## Guiding Principles

* What you foresee is what you get. If you can not envision success, you probably won't find it.
* You can't put off tomorrow. Future takes time to build.

## Tools

### Perspective

Provide broad frame of reference, review past to better anticipate future.

* __Context Maps__ - identify main dimensions of problem or opportunity space
* __Progression Curves__ - contextualize event timelines, industry lifecycles, and other developments
* __Janus Cones__ - view multiple, overlapping, and intersecting events in a single framework

### Opportunity

Understand future customer changes to see growth opportunities now and in the future.

* __Generational Arcs__ - view demographic changes and generational views of target population
* __Future User__ - profile future customer based on what will (and will not) change from today's customer
* __Futuretelling__ - use live theater to illustrate a particular user need as a realistic scene from the future

### Solution

Define questions that exist along different possible paths.

* __White Spots__ - find hidden markets and take a broad look at competitor landscape
* __Paper Mockups__ - create tangible models of ideas which can be tested at low cost for high value
* __Change Paths__ - plot major milestones needed on path to action

* __Dark Horse Prototypes__ - test out a particular option

### Team

Find talent and leadership needed for new innovation.

* __Buddy Checks__ - find matches for partners and teammates
* __VOICE Stars__ - identify aptitudes for radical innovation leadership
* __Crowd Clovers__ - map innovation networks

### Vision

Sharpen team vision to guide action.

* __Vision Statement__ - provide clear and concise summary
* __DARPA Hard Test__ - measure visionary potential of radical innovation
* __Pathfinders__ - determine best path through organization or network

##  How to Start

Types of growth through innovation:

* __core growth__ - create and deliver things that fit into existing portfolio, generally focused on short-term opportunities
* __new growth__ - add new operations or find new markets that complement existing efforts, generally mid-term opportunities
* __emerging growth__ - capitalize on emerging areas and big bets in new or unrelated sectors, generally long term

Places to look for inspiration:

* __organizational start__ - internal R&D or strategy teams
* __internal start__ - promising topic area from an innovator or team leader
* __external start__ - start from scratch, look at statistics, future scenarios, history, and common niches.

Who leads innovation:

* __Pioneer__ - Trust what you can see and follow your gut through trial and error. Scan examples, and see DARPA Hard Test.
* __Problem Solver__ - Identifies assumptions, constraints, and alternatives. See Chapter 3 on Perspective and Change Paths.
* __Analyst__ - Believe effective innovation takes discipline, and appreciate systematic rigor. Learn about layering foresight methods, and see White Spots.
* __Producer__ - Rally others to a shared mindset. See Chapter 4 on Opportunity and Futuretelling.
* __Rebel__ - Routines are negotiable, look outside the box by knowing system close enough to know where to bend rules. See Chapter 7 on Vision and Extend the Future User.
* __Pragmatist__ - Take most effecient path and help others get essentials done without extra work. Skim tips and work with templates.
