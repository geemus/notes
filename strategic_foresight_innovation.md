Playbook for Strategic Foresight and Innovation

## Five Planning Phases

Five Planning Phases give a POSTV path to the future.

* __Perspective__ - Understand what has come before, focus on long-term strategy, 3-5 R&D cycles out.
* __Opportunity__ - Find growth opportunities today and into the future.
* __Solution__ - Define path to innovation, prototype and understand what must be built.
* __Team__ - Find partners and teams members to coordinate and support execution.
* __Vision__ - Develop vision to guide team action toward success.

## Ambiguity Curve

Planning phases may vary from one another, but all are defined by diminishing ambiguity over time.

## Guiding Principles

* What you foresee is what you get. If you can not envision success, you probably won't find it.
* You can't put off tomorrow. Future takes time to build.

# Tools

## Perspective

Provide broad frame of reference, review past to better anticipate future.

* __Context Maps__ - identify main dimensions of problem or opportunity space
* __Progression Curves__ - contextualize event timelines, industry lifecycles, and other developments
* __Janus Cones__ - view multiple, overlapping, and intersecting events in a single framework

## Opportunity

Understand future customer changes to see growth opportunities now and in the future.

* __Generational Arcs__ - view demographic changes and generational views of target population
* __Future User__ - profile future customer based on what will (and will not) change from today's customer
* __Futuretelling__ - use live theater to illustrate a particular user need as a realistic scene from the future

## Solution

Define questions that exist along different possible paths.

* __White Spots__ - find hidden markets and take a broad look at competitor landscape
* __Paper Mockups__ - create tangible models of ideas which can be tested at low cost for high value
* __Change Paths__ - plot major milestones needed on path to action

* __Dark Horse Prototypes__ - test out a particular option

## Team

Find talent and leadership needed for new innovation.

* __Buddy Checks__ - find matches for partners and teammates
* __VOICE Stars__ - identify aptitudes for radical innovation leadership
* __Crowd Clovers__ - map innovation networks

## Vision

Sharpen team vision to guide action.

* __Vision Statement__ - provide clear and concise summary
* __DARPA Hard Test__ - measure visionary potential of radical innovation
* __Pathfinders__ - determine best path through organization or network

#  How to Start

Types of growth through innovation:

* __core growth__ - create and deliver things that fit into existing portfolio, generally focused on short-term opportunities
* __new growth__ - add new operations or find new markets that complement existing efforts, generally mid-term opportunities
* __emerging growth__ - capitalize on emerging areas and big bets in new or unrelated sectors, generally long term

Places to look for inspiration:

* __organizational start__ - internal R&D or strategy teams
* __internal start__ - promising topic area from an innovator or team leader
* __external start__ - start from scratch, look at statistics, future scenarios, history, and common niches.

Who leads innovation:

* __Pioneer__ - Trust what you can see and follow your gut through trial and error. Scan examples, and see DARPA Hard Test.
* __Problem Solver__ - Identifies assumptions, constraints, and alternatives. See Chapter 3 on Perspective and Change Paths.
* __Analyst__ - Believe effective innovation takes discipline, and appreciate systematic rigor. Learn about layering foresight methods, and see White Spots.
* __Producer__ - Rally others to a shared mindset. See Chapter 4 on Opportunity and Futuretelling.
* __Rebel__ - Routines are negotiable, look outside the box by knowing system close enough to know where to bend rules. See Chapter 7 on Vision and Extend the Future User.
* __Pragmatist__ - Take most effecient path and help others get essentials done without extra work. Skim tips and work with templates.

# Perspective

Develop historical perspective about an area of interest relevant to the future you want to create. By understanding the past you can better understand what may happen again and why.

Questions that drive this phase:

* What is the bigger context for the topic we are interested in?
* What historical events, industry actions, and societal movements can be identified as drivers?
* When reviewing previous inventions and opportunities, what similarities in timing and adoption exist today?

## Context Maps

Capture themes that emerge when discussing complex problems. Identify eight core dimensions in order to focus further work.

Instructions:

1. Agree on a broad topic or opportunity area your team wants to pursue. You set the scale of the topic. Very broad topics may require several iterations.
2. Draw an outline for a Context Map or use a template. (looks like a big flower with eight petals and the topic/opportunity in the center)
3. Strat talking with your team about your topic, noting any salient dimensions as they arise. Points of intense discussion or even disagreement are good to include in your context map.
4. Note side topics and connections around your Context Map. At times, you may jump to creata a tangential or different Context Map. That is great association.
5. Repeat the process until your team arrives at a map (or set of maps) that captures your problem space satisfactorily.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Which dimension did you spend the most time discussing?
  * Which dimension generate the greatest number of questions?
  * Which dimension generated the greated number of questions that you can't answer today?
  * After discussing as a group, do you want to redraw the map based on what you have learned?

## Progression Curves

Represent the evolution of changes in terms of technological, social, and other filters. By identifying repeating patterns, you know what to expect in the future. Layering data helps identify patterns that may have been missed previously.

Instructions:

1. Identify your starting topic. Your team could describe past developments for your idea, company, industry, society, technology area, etc. Some teams refer to their last Context Map, developing a Progression Curve per dimension.
2. Draw a long s-curve. You can always extend this curve or link other curves to it later. The height or length of the curve are largely symbolic.
3. Begin pletting key events that have influenced or changed in that space, estimating dates when necessary. The farthest left end point on the curve is set by you, going as far back in time as you wish. The farthes right end point represents today because you are not looking to project the future.
4. Add more data points along the curve. You may mix a variety of data points, such as historical dates, major events, people, company milestones, and social movements.
5. Draw more curves that intersect, extend, and even overlap with your first curve.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * Which dimensions did you begin with? Why?
  * Who can you contact to verify timelines and fill in any gaps?
  * Are you surprised by how long (or quickly) progress takes?
  * Was it easier to add examples and activites your team was personally involved in? Why?

## Janus Cones

Looks backwards and forwards in time to identify the timing of historical events and how timing affects potential future events. Lets you release strict linear assumptions of events, allowing multiple, overlapping, and intersecting events in a single shared framework. Each vertical marker denotes a specific time period, such as 5 or 10 years, going incrementally backwards or forwards.

Instructions:

1. Draw an open cone facing left toward the past. The right point represents today.
2. Talke about what has happened or changed leading up to today's views and assumptions for your topic. Identify major points in time, such as a company founding. Plot these data points inside the cone, placing earlier ones further back in time than more recent points.
3. Now draw appropriate time markers under the cone, such as "1990s" or "2000" to help you cluster and organize data points by time period.
4. Draw corresponding time arcs to those dates, these arcs will be vertical.
5. Add more data points so that you complete your team team's knowledge and fill in all time periods as much as possible.
6. Reflect on what you learned in the process, here are some potential discussion questions:
  * How far back in time do your Janus Cones go? Why to that point in time?
  * If you overlaid your Progression Curves on the Janus Cones timeline, did anything surprise you?
  * Did you try adding events that changed society's attitudes (such as the British Invasion) or had long-term effects (such as the dot-com bubble)?
  * Who can you contact to fill in gaps in your map?

You should look back at least twice as far as you want to look ahead. Similarly, you are strongly advised to fill in the past side of the cones first.
