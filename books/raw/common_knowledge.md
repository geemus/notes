# Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know by Nancy M. Dixon

- People distinguish between tangible information like documents and what they have learned from experience. They also are less likely to share what experience has one without some personal benefit. Little benefit comes from contributing to a database.
- If we want people to share, we should create an environment in which doing so provides personal benefit.
- Share means both "give away" and "share in common", in knowledge management you get to do both.
- Names matter. For some "lessons learned" meant mistakes and this created friction. Even the "management" in knowledge management feels loaded. Focus on a term that signifies what is to be accomplished, rather than the kind/type/quality of knowledge to be shared. Better yet, focus on the outcome rather than the process. ie "Lessons Learned Database" vs "Peer Assist".
- Common knowledge is the knowledge employees learn from doing the organization's tasks. The "know how" rather than "know what" which is often unique to a particular organization which can provide competitive advantage because it is not equally available to competitors. It is also common because across the organization, many people have similar know how. Distinct from information, knowledge always links information to it's application in action in a specific setting.
- The book seeks to gather lessons learned about doing lessons learned.
- It is critical to develop multiple approaches for transfer, even if one is very successful.
- Three major shifts in how we think about knowledge:
  - Shift from thinking that experts are the primary source to thinking that everyone has useful knowledge. There may not be authoritative sources, so ground truth may need to be relied upon.
  - Shift from thinking of knowledge as residing with individuals to embedded in a group or community. This can be problematic at organizations that focus reward/incentive at the individual level.
  - Shift from thinking of knowledge as a stable commodity to thinking of it as dynamic and ever changing. Dynamic view conceives of knowledge as a temporary explanation used to guide action. This moves from something like a warehouse metaphor to one of flowing water.
- Critical Elements for Integrating Systems:
  - The relationship between the knowledge to be transferred and the larger goals of the unit or organization.
  - The specific population the system targets.
  - The specific benefit the target population receives from participating.
  - How the system is monitored.
  - Who has specific responsibilities for knowledge transfer.
  - The control of the system.
- Getting Started Building an Integrated System:
  - Select a unit that has an interest in knowledge sharing.
  - Establish a steering committee. Not about the nitty-gritty of operating the system, but instead making policy, articulating objectives and gathering resources.
  - Conduct a knowledge assessment. Include internal and external participants to gain perspective. Should provide information to steering committee to help guide their decisions.
  - Establish the framework for knowledge transfer. Should guide steering committee planning while being tailored to specifics of the organization.
  - Identify an organizational goal and corresponding knowledge component.
  - Identify the appropriate transfer process for each type of knowledge.
  - Locate current informal systems that can be enhanced.
  - Identify resources.
  - Develop an integrated system for knowledge transfer.

## Myths

- Knowledge isn't for collecting/storing (as in a warehouse), but for reuse.
- Technology can't replace face-to-face, or vice versa, but they can enhance one another.
- Effective exchange can lead to a learning culture, and is easier to achieve.

## Creating and Leveraging Common Knowledge

- Common knowledge requires repeated engagement in the creation of knowledge and the transfer of it across time and space to create leverage.
- Creating knowledge requires intention and reflection, and is critical for current viability. Whereas transfer is critical for future viability.
- Most examples in the book focus on team knowledge, rather than individual knowledge, because that is where most organizations focus.
- One important difference in context between teams is their "absorptive capacity", which is the notion that a team or individual needs to already have a certain amount of related knowledge in order to absorb the new knowledge.

## Transfer Type Decision Tree

By looking at the intended receiver, kind of task, and type of knowledge a transfer system can be tailored to the particular situation.

- Will the same team be using what has been learned?
  - YES: Serial Transfer
  - NO: Is the knowledge tacit?
    - YES: Does the knowledge impact the whole organization?
      - YES: Strategic Transfer.
      - NO: Far Transfer.
    - NO: Is the task routine and frequent?
      - YES: Near Transfer.
      - NO: Expert Transfer.

## Serial Transfer

When a team does a task and then the same team repeats the task in a new context.
- Receiving team does a similar task in a new context.
- Task is frequent and nonroutine.
- Knowledge is tacit and explicit.

- Knowledge from previous attempts helps in future attempts, but only if knowledge is transfered from individuals to the team as a whole.
- Serial transfer moves unique knowledge from each individual into a group or public space so that it can be integrated and made sense of by the whole team.
- Individual team members can use what others say to reinterpret their own understanding.
- Experience is a poor teacher because it requires interpretation of what are often confusing facts and events. [Levinthal and March, The Myopia of Learning]. The relationship between cause and effect is often complex.
- A functional way to create useful and valid knowledge from experience is to use the checks and balances that multiple perspectives provide, especially those offered in the spirit of learning.
- Expertise can provide input, but the relationship between acions and outcomes is more accurately drawn by a group that can correct, support, and build on each other's insights.
- Examples: U.S. Army - After Action Review, British Petroleum - After Action Reviews, Bechtel - Lessons Learned Meetings
- Business Driver: Get a team to improve it's outcome measures by carufelly examining the relationship between the actions of members and the outcomes they have achieved.
- Those who generate the knowledge must also be those who can act upon it. Team members must also be interdependent and working together toward an agreed-upon goal.
- Teams have often met to reflect on what has happened, but meeting with the purpose of constructing knowledge out of their experience is relatively new.
- Focuses on collective knowledge, rather than individual knowledge. Allows for complex relationship between action and outcome and assumes team members add valuable perspective that helps make the relationship more accurate.
- Serial Transfer Design Guidelines:
  - Meetings are held regularly. Either at a scheduled time (ie weekly) or at the end of a defined action. They should not be in response to a success or failure, but just a routine part of how the work gets done. The regularity can also reduce fear of blame.
  - Meetings are brief. Thanks to their regularity and having a consistent format. For example the U.S. Army always reviews just three questions: What was supposed to happen? What happened? What accounts for the difference?
  - Everyone involved in the action participates in the meeting. Information and ideas from everyone is necessary to get the full picture and everyone attending is evidence of shared responsibility.
  - There are no recriminations. U.S. Army rules state nothing in an AAR can be used in any kind of personnel action. May have to be experienced to be believed, can be helped by lighthearted response and/or acknowledgement of fault by leaders.
  - Reports are not forwarded. There may be no written record, or if notes are taken they are only retained for local use and distribution to provide psychological safety. What is learned may be shared at some later point, but it is not effective to do so through sharing the meeting reports directly.
  - Meetings are facilitated locally. The facilitator should be a member of the team. Their responsibility is to remind the group of the simple guidelines and keep them focused on the few critical questions.
- Barriers and Problems:
  - Team members won't take the time to meet. In order to take the time, they need to see the value. This can be helped if the team owns the outcome measures which can then help them identify areas for improvement.
  - Team members lack the skills to have knowledge-producing conversations. More explicit knowledge needs little more than 1) standardized questions 2) a team member to facilitate who is familiar with the process 3) basic norms of truth telling and 4) a no-recrimination policy. For more tacit knowledge greater skill may be needed, such as advocacy and inquiry, what Chris Argyris calls Model II. [Argyris. Knowledge for Action: A Guide to Overcoming Barriers to Organizational Change]
  - Team members disperse before the end of the project. Even in this context there can be value, as if the team holds regular meetings while they are together, each dispersing member will take more knowledge with them to wherever they end up.
  - The team is virtual. Serial transfer can still work as long as the design guidelines are held to.

## Near Transfer

When a team is transferring knowledge to a different team doing a similar task in a similar context, but in a different location.
- Receiving team does a task similar to that of the source team and in a similar context.
- Task is frequent and routine.
- Knowledge is explicit.

- When a team has learned something that the organization would like to replicate to other teams doing similar work.
- Learning theorists know that the more a learning experience resembles the place and situation where the knowledge will be used, the more effective the transfer, which they call near transfer. [Gagne. The Conditions of Learning and Theory of Instruction]
- In many organizations this sort of improvement is thought of as "best practice."
- Examples: Ford - Best Practice Replication, Texas Instrument - Alert Notification System, Ernst & Young - PowerPacks.
- Business Driver: Not about sharing knowledge, but about meeting specific business goals, ie increasing efficiency. Leadership must construct the connection and recipients must clearly undestand it to drive impact.
- Near Transfer Design Guidelines:
  - Knowledge is disseminated electronically. Facilitated by most knowledge to transfer being explicit.
  - Electronic dissemination is supplemented by personal interaction. Face-to-face meetinsg reinforce relationships and show the knowledge/experience of the originators, this makes it more likely the knowledge will be put into action.
  - Users specify the content and format. People receiving the knowledge can best identify 1) process to support transfer, 2) what should be included, and 3) the format. This also demonstrates that control is at the edges, rather than centrally located.
  - Knowledge is pushed. Pushing is seen as a time saving, rather than a control device. Recipients don't have to know to search, and don't have to spend time doing so and sorting through large amounts of unrelated data.
  - A limited number of items are pushed. Both the number must be low and the quality must be high.
  - There is compliance with choice. Teams are expected to participate, both by contributing and by acknowledging receipt, but they are not required to implement any particular shared practice.
  - Usage and business goals are monitored. Using something like a scorecard to show how many items have been contributed, acknowledged, and implemented for each team.
  - Brief descriptions are adequate. Because of the similarity of contexts from originator to recipient, the reports can generally be standardized and minimized to make both submission and review faster.
  - The database is targeted. Rather than a repository for everything, focus on databases targeted to a specific topic or community of practice.
- Barriers and Problems:
  - We tried a best practice database but company members didn't use it. The database is only one small part of the puzzle, you also need 1) well designed business driver, 2) identified knowledge related to the driver, 3) face-to-face knowledge to "warrant" the knowledge, 4) a way to publicly monitor usage and goals, and 5) designated people responsible for input and retreival. Near transfer nedes all of these pieces in place.
  - If it's not invented here we won't use it. Find out who is sharing information, what they are sharing, and why others need it. Then construct a system that fits that culture.
  - People don't have time to share. If it isn't possible to transfer with brevity, it's probably not explicit knowledge, and one of the other methods may be better suited.

## Far Transfer

When a team is transferring tacit knowledge about a nonroutine task. Allows leveraging very specialized and critical knowledge to support costly decisions and problems.
- Receiving team does a task similar to that of the source team, but in a different context.
- Task is frequent and nonroutine.
- Knowledge is tacit.

- When a team has learned something that the the organizaiton would like to make available to other teams doing similar work.
- Most knowledge that makes an organization competitive is tacit, rather than explicit. This is why companies compete so aggressively around employees. Writing it off as "difficult to transfer" is ignoring a company's most valuable knowledge asset.
- Examples: British Petroleum - Peer Assist, Chevron - Capital Project Management, Lockheed Martin - LM21 Best Practices.
- Business Driver: high-level, visible and determined at the corporate level.
- Far Transfer Design Guidelines: (many ways to do this, but largely situation dependent, so less easy to replicate)
  - Exchange is reciprocal. Originators know they will also come away from the experience with more knowledge.
  - Source team knowledge is translated. Because team contexts are so different, knowledge has to be translated by one of the teams to the new context.
  - People carry the tacit knowledge across the organization. Databases are not able to translate things to new contexts readily because they are explicit knowledge. People carry with them tacit knowledge that makes translation possible.
  - Process is given a regonizable name. Provides a way to reference the process and takes it from an individual asking for help to a sanctioned organizational activity. This can remove concerns about being a pest/bother for instance. Names with a business ring can further help distance from "asking for help"
- Barriers and Problems:
  - We don't know how to get knowledge out of people's heads. You don't get tacit knowledge out of a person, you just move the person to where the knowledge is needed.
  - Our people won't ask for help. In any organization there will already be a few people asking for and giving help, start there and scale. Even just 10-15% participation can build a knowledge-sharing culture. [Macy. Learning Theory and the Logic of Critical Mass]

## Strategic Transfer

When transferring very complex knowledge from one team to another when the teams may be separated by both time and space. Unlike Far Transfer, the impact is to large parts of the system, rather than one team or unit.
- Receiving team does a task that impacts the whole organization in a context different from that of the source team.
- Task is infrequent and nonroutine.
- Knowledge is tacit and explicit.

- When a team is taking on a one-off project and wants to benefit from others in the organization who have done similar tasks.
- Strategic transfer is what people are wishing for when they say they don't want to "keep reinventing the wheel."
- Requires translation, similar to far transfer, but for tasks that have a much broader impact across the organization.
- Makes organizational knowledge available that otherwise would be lost or forgotten, extending it's shelf life. [Milton. Knowledge with Shelf Life]
- Examples: British Petroleum - Knowledge Assets, U.S. Army - Center for Army Lessons Learned, Learning Histories
- Business Driver: need to reduce costs and time involved in reinventing solutions to strategic issues.
- Strategic Transfer Design Guidelines:
  - Knowledge needed is identified by senior-level managers. Used when knowledge is presumed to exist somewhere, although it may be widely dispersed. Managers also need to identify where it exists.
  - Knowledge specialists collect and interpret knowledge. These specialists need to formulate questions that get at the reasoning of interviewees, recognize inferences others make, and ask questions to test those inferences. These require considerable training and preparation. It is also often helpful for the collector to come from outside the team to bring perspective and avoid bias.
  - Collection occurs in real time rather than retrospectively. In fact the collectors actions may actually influence and improve the situation while they are collecting.
  - Focus is on the end user. Need to uncover not just the knowledge, but to frame it based on what the end user will need.
  - Multiple voices are synthesized. Not just multiple collectors, but also multiple analysts and multiple people providing feedback on their interpretations. Inputs synthesize knowledge but also illustrate, amplify, verify, and continually challenge it.
- Barriers and Problems:
  - It's too expensive to have a group of knowledge specialists. You can borrow people on a temporary basis, as U.S. Army CALL does. Partly the problem is actual cost vs perceived cost as well, still it really only makes sense to incur this cost for things critical to the organizations future, otherwise less costly methods should be used.
  - If the company identifies a "way to do something" we will all have to conform. Strategic Transfer should inform without dictating. Two safeguards are making principles on which knowledge sharing is based conspicuous and to build into knowledge products multiple voices representing multiple options.

## Expert Transfer

When transferring explicit knowledge about a task that may be done infrequently. Because the needed expertise can be made explicit, the problem does not need interpreted, only clearly stated.
- teams facing an unusual technical problem beyond the scope of their own knowledge seek the expertise of others in the organization to help them.
- Receiving team does a different task from the source team, but in a similar context.
- Task is infrequent and routine.
- Knowledge is explicit.

- Even when the knowledge is obscure in expert transfer, there is a known, explicit answer. It is not a matter of interpretation (such as far tranfer) or development (such as strategic transfer).
- Electronic systems facilitate the transfer of explicit knowledge as messages can be brief and to the point, requesting very specific information.
- Two ways to get answers: 1) broadcast the question to colleagues who are likely to have the answer or 2) use yellow pages functionality to identify a specific individual whose expertise makes it likely they will have the answer.
- Examples: Buckman labs - Techforums, Tandem - Second-Class Mail, Chevron - Best Practices Resource Map.
- Business Driver: Reduces time it takes teams to resolve nonroutine technical issues that they come across.
- Expert Transfer Design Guidelines:
  - Electronic forums are segmented by topic. Important to 1) reduce number of requests received and 2) send requests between people who have the same general knowledge, allowing brevity. Forums are seldom stand-alone, often accompanied by networked groups, communities of practice, meetings, trainings, announcements, etc.
  - Electronic forums are monitored and supported.
    - One or more persons are appointed to monitor and support each forum.
    - Make sure questions are answered. Monitor checks to see if responses have been made, usually in a set time period, and otherwise forwards directly to a source who can answer.
    - Archive responses. When responses have stopped or after a set time, the monitor summarizes, assigns keywords, and places summary where others can find it. Others can then first search the archive before asking new questions.
    - Establish general guidelines.
    - Attend to cultural differences. Adjust usage and other things to support particular user needs.
    - Differing levels of participation are encouraged. The perception of sharing may be as important as the reality. People need to feel they can get help from others.
    - Knowledge in pulled. Unlike some systems, users do not have to search, but instead make very specific requests and/or find very specific answers.
- Barriers and Problems:
  - Our technology is not sophisticated enough to connect people. Different people may be at different places in technology adoption, most opt to set up a system for those who can get in and let others catch up.
  - Our people aren't computer literate. Less and less of an issue these days.
