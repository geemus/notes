# Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know by Nancy M. Dixon

- People distinguish between tangible information like documents and what they have learned from experience. They also are less likely to share what experience has one without some personal benefit. Little benefit comes from contributing to a database.
- If we want people to share, we should create an environment in which doing so provides personal benefit.
- Share means both "give away" and "share in common", in knowledge management you get to do both.
- Names matter. For some "lessons learned" meant mistakes and this created friction. Even the "management" in knowledge management feels loaded. Focus on a term that signifies what is to be accomplished, rather than the kind/type/quality of knowledge to be shared. Better yet, focus on the outcome rather than the process. ie "Lessons Learned Database" vs "Peer Assist".
- Common knowledge is the knowledge employees learn from doing the organization's tasks. The "know how" rather than "know what" which is often unique to a particular organization which can provide competitive advantage because it is not equally available to competitors. It is also common because across the organization, many people have similar know how. Distinct from information, knowledge always links information to it's application in action in a specific setting.
- The book seeks to gather lessons learned about doing lessons learned.

## Myths

- Knowledge isn't for collecting/storing (as in a warehouse), but for reuse.
- Technology can't replace face-to-face, or vice versa, but they can enhance one another.
- Effective exchange can lead to a learning culture, and is easier to achieve.

## Creating and Leveraging Common Knowledge

- Common knowledge requires repeated engagement in the creation of knowledge and the transfer of it across time and space to create leverage.
- Creating knowledge requires intention and reflection, and is critical for current viability. Whereas transfer is critical for future viability.
- Most examples in the book focus on team knowledge, rather than individual knowledge, because that is where most organizations focus.
- One important difference in context between teams is their "absorptive capacity", which is the notion that a team or individual needs to already have a certain amount of related knowledge in order to absorb the new knowledge.

## Transfer Type Decision Tree

By looking at the intended receiver, kind of task, and type of knowledge a transfer system can be tailored to the particular situation.

- Will the same team be using what has been learned?
  - YES: Serial Transfer
  - NO: Is the knowledge tacit?
    - YES: Does the knowledge impact the whole organization?
      - YES: Strategic Transfer.
      - NO: Far Transfer.
    - NO: Is the task routine and frequent?
      - YES: Near Transfer.
      - NO: Expert Transfer.

## Serial Transfer

When a team does a task and then the same team repeats the task in a new context.
- Receiving team does a similar task in a new context.
- Task is frequent and nonroutine.
- Knowledge is tacit and explicit.

- Knowledge from previous attempts helps in future attempts, but only if knowledge is transfered from individuals to the team as a whole.
- Serial transfer moves unique knowledge from each individual into a group or public space so that it can be integrated and made sense of by the whole team.
- Individual team members can use what others say to reinterpret their own understanding.
- Experience is a poor teacher because it requires interpretation of what are often confusing facts and events. [Levinthal and March, The Myopia of Learning]. The relationship between cause and effect is often complex.
- A functional way to create useful and valid knowledge from experience is to use the checks and balances that multiple perspectives provide, especially those offered in the spirit of learning.
- Expertise can provide input, but the relationship between acions and outcomes is more accurately drawn by a group that can correct, support, and build on each other's insights.
- Examples: U.S. Army - After Action Review, British Petroleum - After Action Reviews, Bechtel - Lessons Learned Meetings
- Business Driver: Get a team to improve it's outcome measures by carufelly examining the relationship between the actions of members and the outcomes they have achieved.
- Those who generate the knowledge must also be those who can act upon it. Team members must also be interdependent and working together toward an agreed-upon goal.
- Teams have often met to reflect on what has happened, but meeting with the purpose of constructing knowledge out of their experience is relatively new.
- Focuses on collective knowledge, rather than individual knowledge. Allows for complex relationship between action and outcome and assumes team members add valuable perspective that helps make the relationship more accurate.
- Serial Transfer Design Guidelines:
  - Meetings are held regularly. Either at a scheduled time (ie weekly) or at the end of a defined action. They should not be in response to a success or failure, but just a routine part of how the work gets done. The regularity can also reduce fear of blame.
  - Meetings are brief. Thanks to their regularity and having a consistent format. For example the U.S. Army always reviews just three questions: What was supposed to happen? What happened? What accounts for the difference?
  - Everyone involved in the action participates in the meeting. Information and ideas from everyone is necessary to get the full picture and everyone attending is evidence of shared responsibility.
  - There are no recriminations. U.S. Army rules state nothing in an AAR can be used in any kind of personnel action. May have to be experienced to be believed, can be helped by lighthearted response and/or acknowledgement of fault by leaders.
  - Reports are not forwarded. There may be no written record, or if notes are taken they are only retained for local use and distribution to provide psychological safety. What is learned may be shared at some later point, but it is not effective to do so through sharing the meeting reports directly.
  - Meetings are facilitated locally. The facilitator should be a member of the team. Their responsibility is to remind the group of the simple guidelines and keep them focused on the few critical questions.
- Barriers and Problems:
  - Team members won't take the time to meet. In order to take the time, they need to see the value. This can be helped if the team owns the outcome measures which can then help them identify areas for improvement.
  - Team members lack the skills to have knowledge-producing conversations. More explicit knowledge needs little more than 1) standardized questions 2) a team member to facilitate who is familiar with the process 3) basic norms of truth telling and 4) a no-recrimination policy. For more tacit knowledge greater skill may be needed, such as advocacy and inquiry, what Chris Argyris calls Model II. [Argyris. Knowledge for Action: A Guide to Overcoming Barriers to Organizational Change]
  - Team members disperse before the end of the project. Even in this context there can be value, as if the team holds regular meetings while they are together, each dispersing member will take more knowledge with them to wherever they end up.
  - The team is virtual. Serial transfer can still work as long as the design guidelines are held to.

## Near Transfer

When a team is transferring knowledge to a different team doing a similar task in a similar context, but in a different location.
- Receiving team does a task similar to that of the source team and in a similar context.
- Task is frequent and routine.
- Knowledge is explicit.

- When a team has learned something that the organization would like to replicate to other teams doing similar work.
- Learning theorists know that the more a learning experience resembles the place and situation where the knowledge will be used, the more effective the transfer, which they call near transfer. [Gagne. The Conditions of Learning and Theory of Instruction]
- In many organizations this sort of improvement is thought of as "best practice."
- Examples: Ford - Best Practice Replication, Texas Instrument - Alert Notification System, Ernst & Young - PowerPacks.
- Business Driver: Not about sharing knowledge, but about meeting specific business goals, ie increasing efficiency. Leadership must construct the connection and recipients must clearly undestand it to drive impact.
- Near Transfer Design Guidelines:
  - Knowledge is disseminated electronically. Facilitated by most knowledge to transfer being explicit.
  - Electronic dissemination is supplemented by personal interaction. Face-to-face meetinsg reinforce relationships and show the knowledge/experience of the originators, this makes it more likely the knowledge will be put into action.
  - Users specify the content and format. People receiving the knowledge can best identify 1) process to support transfer, 2) what should be included, and 3) the format. This also demonstrates that control is at the edges, rather than centrally located.
  - Knowledge is pushed. Pushing is seen as a time saving, rather than a control device. Recipients don't have to know to search, and don't have to spend time doing so and sorting through large amounts of unrelated data.
  - A limited number of items are pushed. Both the number must be low and the quality must be high.
  - There is compliance with choice. Teams are expected to participate, both by contributing and by acknowledging receipt, but they are not required to implement any particular shared practice.
  - Usage and business goals are monitored. Using something like a scorecard to show how many items have been contributed, acknowledged, and implemented for each team.
  - Brief descriptions are adequate. Because of the similarity of contexts from originator to recipient, the reports can generally be standardized and minimized to make both submission and review faster.
  - The database is targeted. Rather than a repository for everything, focus on databases targeted to a specific topic or community of practice.
- Barriers and Problems:
  - We tried a best practice database but company members didn't use it. The database is only one small part of the puzzle, you also need 1) well designed business driver, 2) identified knowledge related to the driver, 3) face-to-face knowledge to "warrant" the knowledge, 4) a way to publicly monitor usage and goals, and 5) designated people responsible for input and retreival. Near transfer nedes all of these pieces in place.
  - If it's not invented here we won't use it. Find out who is sharing information, what they are sharing, and why others need it. Then construct a system that fits that culture.
  - People don't have time to share. If it isn't possible to transfer with brevity, it's probably not explicit knowledge, and one of the other methods may be better suited.

## Far Transfer

When a team is transferring tacit knowledge about a nonroutine task. Allows leveraging very specialized and critical knowledge to support costly decisions and problems.

## Strategic Transfer

When transferring very complex knowledge from one team to another when the teams may be separated by both time and space. Unlike Far Transfer, the impact is to large parts of the system, rather than one team or unit.

## Expert Transfer

When transferring explicit knowledge about a task that may be done infrequently. Because the needed expertise can be made explicit, the problem does not need interpreted, only clearly stated.
