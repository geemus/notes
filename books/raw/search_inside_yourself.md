## Mindfulness Meditation

Let us begin by sitting comfortably. Sit in a poition that enables you to be both relaxed and alert at the same time, whatever that means to to you. Or, if you prefer, you may sit like a majestic mountain, whatever that means to you.
Let us now take three slow, deep breaths to inject both energy and relaxation into our practice.
Now, let us breathe naturally and bring a very gentle attention to your breath. You can either bring attention to the nostrils, the abdomen, or the entire body of breath, whatever that means to you. Become aware of in breath, out breath, and space in between.
(Short pause)
If you like, you can think of this exercise as resting the mind on the breath. You can visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it, very gently. Just be.
(Long pause)
If at any time you feel distracted by a sensation, thought, or sound, just acknowledge it, experience it, and very gently let it go. Bring your attention very gently back to the breathing.
(Long pause)
If you like, let us end this meditation by inviting joyful inner peace to arise.
Breathing in, I am calm.
Breathing out, I smile.
This present moment,
Wonderful.
(Short pause)
Thank you for your attention.

# 3: Mindfulnes without Butt on Cushion

## Walking Meditation

Start by standing still. Bring attention to this body. Become aware of the pressure on the feet as they touch the ground. Take a moment to experience this body standing on the ground.
Now take a step forward. Lift one foot mindfully, move it forward mindfully, plant it down in front of you mindfully, and shift your weight to this foot mindfully. Take a short pause, and do it with the other foot.
If you like, when lifting your foot, you may repeat silently to yourself, "Lifting, lifting, lifting," and when moving and plating your foot forward, you may repeat silently to yourself, "Moving, moving, moving."
After taking a number of steps, you may wish to stop and turn around. When you decide to stop, just take a few seconds to become mindful of your body in a standing position. If you like, you may repeat silently to yourself, "Standing, standing, standing." As you turn around do it mindfully, and if you like, you may repeat silently to yourself, "Turning, turning, turning."
If you wish, you may synchronize your movement with your breathing. When lifting your foot, breathe in, and when moving and planting your foot, breathe out. Doing this may help inject calmness into the experience.

Let us begin by sitting comfortably in a position that enable you to be both relaxed and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you.
Let us rest the mind. If you like, you can visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it.
(Short pause)
Let us shift into focused attention. Bring your attention to your breath, or any other object of meditation you choose. Let this attention be stable like a rock, undisturbed by any distraction. If the mind is distracted, gently but firmly bring the mind back. Let's continue this exercise for the remainder of 3 minutes.
(Long pause)
Now we shift into open attention. Bring yoru attention to whatever you experience and whatever comes to mind. Let this attention be flexible like grass moving in the wind. In this mind, there is no such thing as a distraction. Every object you experience is an object of meditation. Everything is fair game. Let us continue this exercise for the remainder of 3 minutes.
(Long pause)
(Shift to focused attention for 3 minutes, Then shift to open attention for 3 minutes)
Let us end this sitting by resting the mind. If you like, you can again visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cusion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it.
(Long pause)
Thank you for your attention.

# 4: All-Natural, Organic Self-Confidence

## Body Scan

### Settling Attention

Let us begin by sitting comfortably for 2 minutes. Sit in a position that enable you to be both relaxed and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you.
Now, let us breathe naturally and bring very gentle attention to the breath. You can either bring attention to the nostrils, the abdomen, or the entire body of breath, whatever that means to you. Become aware of in breath, out breath, and space in between.

### Scan Body

#### Head

Now bring your attention to the top of your head, ears, and back of your head. Notice sensations, or lack of sensations, for 1 minute.

#### Face

Now move your attention to your face. Your forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, lips, mouth, and inside of your mouth (gums, tongue) for 1 minute.

#### Neck and Shoulders

Move you attention to your neck, the inside of your throat, and your shoulders for 1 minute.

#### Back

Move you attention to your lower back, mid back, and upper back for 1 minute. The back carries a lot of our load and stores a lot of our tension. So let us give our backs the kind and loving attention they deserve.

#### Front

Now move your attention to the chest and stomach for 1 minute. If it is possible for you, try to bring attention to your internal organs, whatever that means to you.

#### Entire Body at Once

And now, bring your attention to your entire body all at once for 1 minute.

#### Scan for Emotion

Did you find any emotion in your body? If there is any, just notice its presence in the body. If not, jjust notice the absence of emotions, and catch one if it arises in the next 2 minutes.

#### Positive Emotion

Let us now try to experience a positive emotion in the body.
Bring to mind a memory of a happy, joyous event or a time when you were optimal and productive or a time when you felt confident.
Experience the feeling of positive emotion. Now, bring your attention to your body. What does that positive emotion feel like in the body? In the face? Neck, chest, back? How are you breathing? Any difference in level of tension? Let us just experience it for 3 minutes.

### Returning to Grounding

Let us now return to the present. If you find an emotionally charged thought, just let it go.
Bring your attention to either your body or your breath, whichever your mind finds more stability in. And let's just settle the mind there for 2 minutes.
(Long pause)
Thank you for your attention.
