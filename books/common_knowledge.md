# Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know by Nancy M. Dixon

- Knowledge links information to action in a specific setting.
- Common knowledge collects the "know how" that individuals gain from doing an organization's tasks.
- Common knowledge requires repeated creation of knowledge and the transfer of it across time and space to create leverage.
- If we want people to share, we should create an environment where doing so provides personal benefit.
- For successful transfer we must consider a teams "absorptive capacity", or how much related knowledge they will need to absorb the new knowledge.
- Names matter. Focus names on goals and outcomes, rather than process or aspects of the knowledge involved.

## Transfer Type Decision Tree

Customize the transfer systems to a particular context by looking at the intended receiver, kind of task, and knowledge type:

- Will the same team use the knowledge?
  - YES: Serial Transfer
  - NO: Is the knowledge tacit?
    - YES: Does the knowledge impact the whole organization?
      - YES: Strategic Transfer.
      - NO: Far Transfer.
    - NO: Is the task routine and frequent?
      - YES: Near Transfer.
      - NO: Expert Transfer.

## Serial Transfer

- Transfers tacit and explicit knowledge of a frequent, non-routine task and will repeat similar tasks in a new context.
- Moves unique individual knowledge to the group so that others can update their own understanding, integrate the knowledge, and reuse it.
- Combining perspectives corrects, supports, and builds on each others insights to create a more accurate understanding of the often complex relationship between cause and effect.
- Business Driver: Improve outcome measures by examining the relationship between the actions of members and the outcomes they have achieved.
- Examples: U.S. Army - After Action Review, British Petroleum - After Action Reviews, Bechtel - Lessons Learned Meetings

### Serial Transfer - Design Guidelines:

- Regular meetings. Either on a regular schedule or at the end of a defined action, not in response to events.
- Brief meetings. Regularity and consistent format help keep things concise.
- Everyone involved in the action participates in the meeting. Creates a more accurate view and demonstrates shared responsibility.
- No recriminations. Leaders demonstrating vulnerability helps.
- Local notes. Protect psychological safety by keeping what the discussion within the team.
- Local facilitator. A team member facilitator should remind the group of the guidelines and keep them focused on critical questions.

### Serial Transfer - Barriers and Problems:

- Team members won't take the time to meet. Focus on showing them the value by helping them own related outcome measures.
- Team members lack the skills to have knowledge-producing conversations. Explicit knowledge should transfer thanks to the guidelines. Tacit knowledge may require training in skills such as advocacy and inquiry.
- Team members disperse before the end of the project. Serial transfer still allows each member to leave with more knowledge than they would otherwise have.
- Distributed team. Serial transfer still works as it follows the design guidelines.

## Near Transfer

- Transfers explicit knowledge of a frequent, routine task to a different team doing a similar task in a similar context. Often called "best practices."
- Examples: Ford - Best Practice Replication, Texas Instrument - Alert Notification System, Ernst & Young - PowerPacks.
- Business Driver: Not about sharing knowledge, but about meeting specific business goals like increasing efficiency. Leadership must construct the connection and recipients must understand it to drive impact.

### Near Transfer - Design Guidelines:

- Digital transfer of explicit knowledge.
- Supplemented with personal interaction to reinforce relationships and sense of expertise.
- Users specify process, content and format.
- Push relevant knowledge to save time (not as a control device).
- Limit amount pushed and keep quality high.
- Compliance with choice. Teams must contribute and acknowledge receipt, but may choose for themselves whether to adopt individual practices.
- Monitor usage and business goals such as items contributed, acknowledged, and adopted.
- Keep descriptions brief. Similarity of contexts between originator and recipient allows for short, standardized reports to simplify contribution and review.
- Targeted database. Focus each database to a specific topic or community of practice.

### Near Transfer - Barriers and Problems:

- We tried a best practice database, but it didn't get used. Besides the database, success also requires 1) business driver, 2) identified related knowledge, 3) face-to-face "warranting," 4) publicly monitored usage and goals, and 5) designated people responsible for input and retrieval.
- We won't use what we haven't invented. Construct a system around those who already shares, what they share, and why others need it.
- People don't have time to share. If one can't share briefly, it may not be explicit knowledge, so other methods may be more effective.

## Far Transfer

- Transfers tacit knowledge about a frequent, non-routine task to a different team doing a similar task in a different context.
- Allows leveraging specialized and critical knowledge to support costly decisions and problems.
- Tacit knowledge provides most competitive advantage.
- difficult to replicate due to high degree of situational dependence.
- Examples: British Petroleum - Peer Assist, Chevron - Capital Project Management, Lockheed Martin - LM21 Best Practices.
- Business Driver: high-level, visible and determined at the corporate level.

### Far Transfer - Design Guidelines:

- Reciprocal exchange. Originators also come away from the experience with more knowledge.
- Knowledge requires translation to accommodate differences in context.
- People carry the tacit knowledge necessary for translation, unlike databases which just hold explicit knowledge.
- Recognizable name. Provides a way to reference the process and makes it a sanctioned activity rather than an individual asking for help.

### Far Transfer - Barriers and Problems:

- We don't know how to get tacit knowledge out of people's heads. You don't have to, just move the person the area of need.
- Our people won't ask for help. Find those already asking for and giving help. Start there and scale.

## Strategic Transfer

- Transfers tacit and explicit knowledge about infrequent, non-routine task with broad systemic impact to a different team and context.
- Helps prevent "reinventing the wheel," by preventing the loss or forgetting of strategic organizational knowledge.
- Examples: British Petroleum - Knowledge Assets, U.S. Army - Center for Army Lessons Learned, Learning Histories
- Business Driver: need to reduce costs and time involved in reinventing solutions to strategic issues.

### Strategic Transfer - Design Guidelines:

- Knowledge needs and location identified by senior-level managers.
- Knowledge specialists collect and interpret. Need to get at the reasoning of interviewees, recognize their inferences, and ask questions to test the inferences. May require considerable training and preparation. Can benefit from an external perspective.
- Real time collection, rather than retrospective. Collectors may even influence and improve the situation while collecting.
- End user focus. Translate captured knowledge to reflect what the end user will need.
- Synthesize multiple voices to illustrate, amplify, verify, and continually challenge the knowledge.

### Strategic Transfer - Barriers and Problems:

- Knowledge specialists are too expensive. You can borrow people on a temporary basis, or tease apart actual vs perceived costs. Ultimately reserved for the most critical areas, others should use less costly methods.
- Identifying a "way to do something" will require conformance. Strategic transfer should inform without dictating. Making principles clear, including multiple voices, and including multiple options helps.

## Expert Transfer

- Transfers explicit knowledge about infrequent, routine tasks to a different team doing a different task, but in a similar context.
- Two ways to get answers: 1) broadcasting to those who may know 2) using yellow pages to find individuals to reach out to.
- Examples: Buckman labs - Techforums, Tandem - Second-Class Mail, Chevron - Best Practices Resource Map.
- Business Driver: Reduces time it takes teams to resolve non-routine technical issues that they come across.

### Expert Transfer - Design Guidelines:

- Electronic forums segmented by topic to reduce the number of requests received and keep requests among those with similar knowledge to allow brevity.
- Monitored and supported forums.
  - One or more persons monitor and support each forum.
  - Ensure timely responses, or the monitor forwards to a source.
  - Archive responses after they stop or a set time. Monitor then summarizes and assigns keywords. Others can then search the archive before asking new questions.
  - Monitors establish general guidelines.
  - Monitors attend to cultural differences, adjusting to support particular user needs.
  - Encourage differing levels of participation. People need to feel they can get help from others.
  - Pull knowledge through specific requests and specific answers, rather than generic database searching.

### Expert Transfer - Barriers and Problems:

- Our technology is not sophisticated enough. Focus on helping those who can get in and let others catch up.
- Our people aren't computer literate. Less and less of an issue these days.

## Creating an Integrated System

- Combining methods provides the best support for different kinds of knowledge transfer.

### Critical Elements for Integrating Systems:

- Relationship between knowledge to transfer and larger goals.
- Specifics of target population, including the benefit received from participating.
- How to monitor the system.
- Who has specific responsibilities for knowledge transfer.
- Who controls the system.

### Getting Started Building an Integrated System:

- Select a unit with an interest in knowledge sharing.
- Establish a steering committee to make policy, articulate objectives, and gather resources.
- Conduct a knowledge assessment to guide the steering committee with internal and external participants to provide perspective.
- Establish the framework for knowledge transfer customized to the organization to guide the steering committee.
- Identify an organizational goal and corresponding knowledge component.
- Identify the appropriate transfer process for each knowledge type.
- Locate current informal systems to enhance.
- Identify resources.
- Develop an integrated knowledge transfer system.
