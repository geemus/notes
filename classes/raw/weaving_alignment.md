Weaving Alignment

# Week 1: Orientation

## Alignment: What is it?

* Degree of coherence between intention, motivation, needs and interest between two parties.
* Alignment outcomes: strong agreements, effective collaborations, clear decisions, satisfying solutions, and future adaptability.
* Agreement describes a course of action to be taken, but it does not necessarily alleviate friction.
* We can function inside agreements without alignment, but when aligned our agreements are easier to come by and more robust.
* Primary actions that drive alignment/misalignment:
  * Intend: inner orientation we bring to relationships and engagement with work and other people. Includes self-awareness, self-reflectivity, ways we manage and lead ourselves on the inside.
    * Skills: Sensing & Perceiving, unbiased curiosity, and emotional self-leadership.
  * Relate: all of the nuance that goes into our way of communicating and relating with others. How we listen, or don't; how we express ourselves, how we inquire and check for understanding.
    * Skills: Listening, reflecting, reframing, inquiring, and expressing.
  * Weave: captures all the actions and interventions we make that influence the process of working together with others. The people we seek input from, the way we engage within a meeting, etc.
    * Skills: Identifying & understanding needs & interests, seeing possibilities, and facilitating shared understanding & agreement

# Week 1: Intend

## Sense & Perceive

* Sensing is focused on becoming more aware of signals of alignment/misalignment through a mix of careful attention and curiousity.
* Notice: Sensing is followed quickly by Perception.
* Consider: Aware of what we perceive, we consider it. What significance might it have? What might be biasing my sensing and perceiving? Who might I check my impressions with?
* Act: We determine how to act. How could I communicate with others that might address what I am noticing in a useful way to decrease friction?

## Emotional Self-Leadership

* Make sense of what is going on inside themselves.
* Act on what they are feeling in ways that do not harm others and importantly, transform challenging emotions into useful interventions that support the group's purpose.

## Unbiased Curiosity

* Be wary of bringing too strong of an agenda of your own and maintain openness to being influenced/convinced.
* Be careful not to get caught up in our own story about what is true or right/wrong.
* Let go of trying to be seen as on expert or knowing the answer.
* Requires perseverance and determination.
* Unbiased curiosity is an ongoing practice, not an end state.

# Week 2

## Expression

* Expressing Well: Identify needs and concerns of audience, understand why you want to express, understand impact words might have, and understand the perspective communicated.
* Three perspectives: First person "I statements", second person "we statements" on shared perspective, and third person "if statements" about objective facts.
* Speech acts:
  * Assertions share information. Are there questions to accompany and keep the conversation flowing? Are you advocating? Are you willing to surrender the view?
  * Requests what is needed. Be clear what is required and if it is your own need or a need of the group.
  * Suggestions to make a bid, offer an idea, proposal or possibility. May include ideas, solicit verification, confirmation, or alternatives.
  * Commands to clearly tell someone what to do.
* Double trouble. We lose impact when we combine wrong perspective and wrong speech act.
* Skillful interventions can help others realize when they are using the wrong perspective or speech act and help them reframe.
* Repairs can be used to rework and fix when you realize you have not clearly articulated as intended.

## Listening

* Listening is receiving and validating a perspective, without necessarilly agreeing with it.
* Listening well:
  * clarify your intention to listen fully - what is your purpose?
  * commit to setting your own thoughts and preferences aside when they show up
  * listen to what is not said
  * recieve the experience of the other person, emotion, body, facial expressions, etc
  * interject pauses for clarification, or questions to support yourself to follow along
  * repeat back what you've heard
  * summarize what's been shared
  * reframe if appropriate or desired (can help or hinder depending on your accuracy)
  * check for accuracy of your listening and understanding
  * attend to feedback from the speaker
  * self correct if you missed something or got it wrong
  * allow there to be silence (without needing to fill it)
  * dropping your own theories, ideas; making space for unknown
  * appreciate and validate
* Clarifying - check accuracy, get more info, ask questions, restate wrong interpretations, and invite speaker to explain.
* Restating - to show you are listening and demonstrate understanding, restate the basic ideas and facts as you herad them.
* Reflecting - To express understanding for the person's feelings, both type and intensity of feeling, and to mirror the accurate emotion.
* Summarizing - To demonstrate the speaker's message has been heard, and to pull important ideas, facts, feeling stogether, establishing a basis for moving on in the conversation.
* Validating - To acknowledge the person's perceptions, increase trust, and legitimize the expression of feeling.

## Reframing

* Reframing helps:
  * See situation from larger, more long-term perspective.
  * Move from fixed position to interest-based negotiating stance.
  * Reduce attacks or threatening language.
  * Shift from a negative emphasis to a positive one.
  * Remove values from language and minimize differences in style.
  * Create flexibility in demands.
  * Maintain an atmosphere of safety and good faith.
* Why reframe? When to reframe?
  * To make something understandable.
  * To take the "sting" out.
  * To show commonality between perspectives.
  * To reduce emotional heat.
* Ripe for reframing:
  * "Always" and "never" blaming statements.
  * Criticisms and accusations (including those directed at you).
  * Third person claims about what is the case / will be the case / must happen or not. Especially when used in argumentation as a convincing strategy.
* Positive outcomes of reframing that increase alignment:
  * To receive and relax through being heard.
  * To create more space from an intense emotion or experience.
  * To open up options and choices.
  * To bridge understanding between parties.
* Reframing done poorly:
  * Your intention, unbiased curiosity, and emotional self leadership will help determine how successful your reframing is.
  * You can reframe with an agenda!
  * People can feel your agenda within your reframe, so be careful about using reframing to negate something you don't like about someone else's view.
  * The verification of truth for a reframe is the other person's agreement, so you always need to check their responsiveness to what you offer in your reframe.
* Reframing and power - pay attention if reframing is being used to:
  * Not receive what is being said.
  * Minimize something.
  * Distort intention.
  * Rewrite the story.
  * Assert a different truth through.
  * Avoid challenges to power.
* Suggestions for experimenting with reframing:
  * Choose a safe and trusted relationship.
  * Ask permission to offer a reframe.
  * Keep it simple.
  * Ask how it landed, what the other person felt.
  * Try again.
  * Experience reframing on the receiving end -- invite someone you trust to reframe something you say.

## Questioning

* Types of Questions:
  * Open ended questions invite any range of responses. They are exploratory in nature.
  * Narrowing questions help respondent deepen and clarify thoughts and feelings.
  * Closed questions bring convergence, and have only two options for the respondent -- yes or no.
  * Appreciative questions ask about what has worked.
* Powerful questions:
  * uncover assumptions
  * reveal values
  * open uncharted territory
  * prompt reflection
  * invite new frames of mind
  * reveal commitments and limitations
  * discover patterns in process and relationships
  * allow for emergent ways of seeing the situation or possibility
