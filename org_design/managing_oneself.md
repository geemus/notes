# Managing Oneself (Harvard Business Review Classics) by Peter Ferdinand Drucker

## WHAT ARE MY STRENGTHS? (2)

- Feedback Analysis: when making a key decision or taking a key action, write down your expectations, then schedule time to compare to what actually happens.
- Practiced consistently it will reveal areas of strength, areas lacking strength, what to do, and what not to do.
- Implications:
  - Concentrate on your strengths and put yourself where they can produce results. Waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence.
  - Work on improving strengths.
  - Discover where intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it.
- It can also reveal bad habits that inhibit effectiveness and performance.
  - If analysis shows your brilliant work fails as soon as cooperation is required, your problem may be a lack of manners.

## HOW DO I PERFORM? (10)

- In addition to focusing on strengths, also consider in what ways you perform best. A few common personality traits generally determine this:
- Am I a reader or a listener? Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves into competent readers, and vice versa.
- How do I learn? Most know the answer to this, yet few act on this knowledge.
- Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship? (19)
- Do I produce results as a decision maker or as an adviser? This is a reason, by the way, that the number two person in an organization often fails when promoted to the number one position. (20)
- Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environment? (21)
- Do I work best in a big organization or a small one? (21)

## WHAT ARE MY VALUES? (22)

- That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, What kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning? (23)
- To work in an organization whose value system is unacceptable or incompatible with one’s own condemns a person both to frustration and to nonperformance. (23)
- Whether a business should be run for short-term results or with a focus on the long term is likewise a question of values. (26)
- A person’s strengths and the way that person performs rarely conflict; the two are complementary. But there is sometimes a conflict between a person’s values and his or her strengths. What one does well—even very well and successfully—may not fit with one’s value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one’s life to (or even a substantial portion thereof (29)
- Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test. (30)

## WHERE DO I BELONG? (30)

- But most people, especially highly gifted people, do not really know where they belong until they are well past their mid-twenties. By that time, however, they should know the answers to the three questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? and, What are my values? And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. (31)
- Equally important, knowing the answer to these questions enables a person to say to an opportunity, an offer, or an assignment, “Yes, I will do that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it should be structured. This is the way the relationships should be. These are the kind of results you should expect from me, and in this time frame, because this is who I am.” (32)
- Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. (32)

## WHAT SHOULD I CONTRIBUTE? (33)

- Knowledge workers should ask: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three distinct elements:
  - What does the situation require?
  - Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?
  - And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference?
- So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half (36)
- The results should be a stretch, or hard to achieve, yet within reach. They should be meaningful and make a difference. They should be visible, and if at all possible, measurable.
- From this will come a course of action: what to do, where and how to start, and what goals and deadlines to set. (37)

## RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELATIONSHIPS (37)

- Managing yourself requires taking responsibility for relationships. This has two parts. (38)
- First, accept that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are. (38)
  - To be effective, you have to know the strengths, performance modes, and values of your coworkers. (38)
  - Bosses are neither a title on the organization chart nor a “function.” They are individuals and are entitled to do their work in the way they do it best. It is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to find out how they work, and to adapt themselves to what makes their bosses most effective. This, in fact, is the secret of “managing” the boss. (39)
  - The same holds true for all your coworkers. (40)
- Second is taking responsibility for communication. (40)
  - Even people who understand the importance of taking responsibility for relationships often do not communicate sufficiently with their associates. (43)
  - Whenever someone goes to his or her associates and says, “This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values. This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I should be expected to deliver,” the response is always, “This is most helpful. But why didn’t you tell me earlier?” (43)
  - And one gets the same reaction—without exception, in my experience—if one continues by asking, “And what do I need to know about your strengths, how you perform, your values, and your proposed contribution?” (44)
  - In fact, knowledge workers should request this of everyone with whom they work, whether as subordinate, superior, colleague, or team member. (44)
- Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust. (44)

## THE SECOND HALF OF YOUR LIFE (45)

- There are three ways to develop a second career. (47)
- The first is actually to start one. (47)
  - Often this takes nothing more than moving from one kind of organization to another: (47)
  - But there are also growing numbers of people who move into different lines of work altogether: (47)
- The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career. (48)
  - But in addition, they create a parallel job, usually in a nonprofit organization, that takes another ten hours of work a week. (48)
- Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. (49)
  - In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activity, usually a nonprofit. (49)
- There is one prerequisite for managing the second half of your life: You must begin long before you enter it. (50)
- There is another reason to develop a second major interest, and to develop it early. No one can expect to live very long without experiencing a serious setback in his or her life or work. (52)
- such times, a second major interest—not just a hobby—may make all the difference. (53)
- In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. (53)
- In effect, managing oneself demands that each knowledge worker think and behave like a chief executive officer. (56)
- Every existing society, even the most individualistic one, takes two things for granted, if only subconsciously: that organizations outlive workers, and that most people stay put. (56)
- But today the opposite is true. Knowledge workers outlive organizations, and they are mobile. The need to manage oneself is therefore creating a revolution in human affairs. (56)
