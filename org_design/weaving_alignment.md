Weaving Alignment

# Week 1: Orientation

## Alignment: What is it?

* Degree of coherence between intention, motivation, needs and interest between two parties.
* Alignment outcomes: strong agreements, effective collaborations, clear decisions, satisfying solutions, and future adaptability.
* Agreement describes a course of action to be taken, but it does not necessarily alleviate friction.
* We can function inside agreements without alignment, but when aligned our agreements are easier to come by and more robust.
* Primary actions that drive alignment/misalignment:
  * Intend: inner orientation we bring to relationships and engagement with work and other people. Includes self-awareness, self-reflectivity, ways we manage and lead ourselves on the inside.
    * Skills: Sensing & Perceiving, unbiased curiosity, and emotional self-leadership.
  * Relate: all of the nuance that goes into our way of communicating and relating with others. How we listen, or don't; how we express ourselves, how we inquire and check for understanding.
    * Skills: Listening, reflecting, reframing, inquiring, and expressing.
  * Weave: captures all the actions and interventions we make that influence the process of working together with others. The people we seek input from, the way we engage within a meeting, etc.
    * Skills: Identifying & understanding needs & interests, seeing possibilities, and facilitating shared understanding & agreement

# Week 1: Intend

## Sense & Perceive

* Sensing is focused on becoming more aware of signals of alignment/misalignment through a mix of careful attention and curiousity.
* Notice: Sensing is followed quickly by Perception.
* Consider: Aware of what we perceive, we consider it. What significance might it have? What might be biasing my sensing and perceiving? Who might I check my impressions with?
* Act: We determine how to act. How could I communicate with others that might address what I am noticing in a useful way to decrease friction?

## Emotional Self-Leadership

* Make sense of what is going on inside themselves.
* Act on what they are feeling in ways that do not harm others and importantly, transform challenging emotions into useful interventions that support the group's purpose.

## Unbiased Curiosity

* Be wary of bringing too strong of an agenda of your own and maintain openness to being influenced/convinced.
* Be careful not to get caught up in our own story about what is true or right/wrong.
* Let go of trying to be seen as on expert or knowing the answer.
* Requires perseverance and determination.
* Unbiased curiosity is an ongoing practice, not an end state.

# Week 2

## Expression

* Expressing Well: Identify needs and concerns of audience, understand why you want to express, understand impact words might have, and understand the perspective communicated.
* Three perspectives: First person "I statements", second person "we statements" on shared perspective, and third person "if statements" about objective facts.
* Speech acts:
  * Assertions share information. Are there questions to accompany and keep the conversation flowing? Are you advocating? Are you willing to surrender the view?
  * Requests what is needed. Be clear what is required and if it is your own need or a need of the group.
  * Suggestions to make a bid, offer an idea, proposal or possibility. May include ideas, solicit verification, confirmation, or alternatives.
  * Commands to clearly tell someone what to do.
* Double trouble. We lose impact when we combine wrong perspective and wrong speech act.
* Skillful interventions can help others realize when they are using the wrong perspective or speech act and help them reframe.
* Repairs can be used to rework and fix when you realize you have not clearly articulated as intended.

## Listening

* Listening is receiving and validating a perspective, without necessarilly agreeing with it.
* Listening well:
  * clarify your intention to listen fully - what is your purpose?
  * commit to setting your own thoughts and preferences aside when they show up
  * listen to what is not said
  * recieve the experience of the other person, emotion, body, facial expressions, etc
  * interject pauses for clarification, or questions to support yourself to follow along
  * repeat back what you've heard
  * summarize what's been shared
  * reframe if appropriate or desired (can help or hinder depending on your accuracy)
  * check for accuracy of your listening and understanding
  * attend to feedback from the speaker
  * self correct if you missed something or got it wrong
  * allow there to be silence (without needing to fill it)
  * dropping your own theories, ideas; making space for unknown
  * appreciate and validate
* Clarifying - check accuracy, get more info, ask questions, restate wrong interpretations, and invite speaker to explain.
* Restating - to show you are listening and demonstrate understanding, restate the basic ideas and facts as you herad them.
* Reflecting - To express understanding for the person's feelings, both type and intensity of feeling, and to mirror the accurate emotion.
* Summarizing - To demonstrate the speaker's message has been heard, and to pull important ideas, facts, feeling stogether, establishing a basis for moving on in the conversation.
* Validating - To acknowledge the person's perceptions, increase trust, and legitimize the expression of feeling.

## Reframing

* Reframing helps:
  * See situation from larger, more long-term perspective.
  * Move from fixed position to interest-based negotiating stance.
  * Reduce attacks or threatening language.
  * Shift from a negative emphasis to a positive one.
  * Remove values from language and minimize differences in style.
  * Create flexibility in demands.
  * Maintain an atmosphere of safety and good faith.
* Why reframe? When to reframe?
  * To make something understandable.
  * To take the "sting" out.
  * To show commonality between perspectives.
  * To reduce emotional heat.
* Ripe for reframing:
  * "Always" and "never" blaming statements.
  * Criticisms and accusations (including those directed at you).
  * Third person claims about what is the case / will be the case / must happen or not. Especially when used in argumentation as a convincing strategy.
* Positive outcomes of reframing that increase alignment:
  * To receive and relax through being heard.
  * To create more space from an intense emotion or experience.
  * To open up options and choices.
  * To bridge understanding between parties.
* Reframing done poorly:
  * Your intention, unbiased curiosity, and emotional self leadership will help determine how successful your reframing is.
  * You can reframe with an agenda!
  * People can feel your agenda within your reframe, so be careful about using reframing to negate something you don't like about someone else's view.
  * The verification of truth for a reframe is the other person's agreement, so you always need to check their responsiveness to what you offer in your reframe.
* Reframing and power - pay attention if reframing is being used to:
  * Not receive what is being said.
  * Minimize something.
  * Distort intention.
  * Rewrite the story.
  * Assert a different truth through.
  * Avoid challenges to power.
* Suggestions for experimenting with reframing:
  * Choose a safe and trusted relationship.
  * Ask permission to offer a reframe.
  * Keep it simple.
  * Ask how it landed, what the other person felt.
  * Try again.
  * Experience reframing on the receiving end -- invite someone you trust to reframe something you say.

## Questioning

* Types of Questions:
  * Open ended questions invite any range of responses. They are exploratory in nature.
  * Narrowing questions help respondent deepen and clarify thoughts and feelings.
  * Closed questions bring convergence, and have only two options for the respondent -- yes or no.
  * Appreciative questions ask about what has worked.
* Powerful questions:
  * uncover assumptions
  * reveal values
  * open uncharted territory
  * prompt reflection
  * invite new frames of mind
  * reveal commitments and limitations
  * discover patterns in process and relationships
  * allow for emergent ways of seeing the situation or possibility

# Week 3

## Mapping

* Zoom out - view situation from a neutral third person perspective.
* Get curious - Set down your own needs / interests /perspective.
* Endeavor to take a generous view of other perspectives.
* Generate your own best sense of the diverse needs & interests at play.
* Ask yourself where you might be wrong (often!)
* Seek perspectives in an open way - Engage others to discover / disprove / corroborate your perceptions.
* Refine and revise your mapping based on what you learn.

# Week 4

## Positions, Needs & Interests

* Position - a surface statement about an issue.
  * Tend to be fixed, often resulting in zero-sum thinking.
* Needs and interests - the why behind a position.
  * Allow discussion to get underneath position to understand driving values and build shared understanding.
* We may not have a clear picture of our own needs and interests, which may make it difficult to see beyond our position, and may not have the best idea about what would ultimately satisfy us.

## Engage to Elicit Needs & Interests

* The Process
  * Ask Open Questions
  * Listen (focus, receive, clarify as needed)
  * Reflect back values/needs/interests (this focus/reflection sets this practice apart form generic active listening)
  * Check for accuracy
  * Repeat
* Helps speaker clarify through the process as well as the listener.

## Review

* Listen for what's at the heart of what is being said or communicated.

# Week 5

## Preparing to Convene

* Stakeholders
  * Who needs to be at the table? Is there anyone not currently included that should be?
  * Are any perspectives primarily due to authority / scope of influence?
  * Can we go connect with those people and learn about their needs & interests?
  * Have you learned enough about the needs & interests of each stakeholder?
  * Would further 1:1 flesh out the picture? What stakeholders do you still need to connect with?
* Clarifying
  * How do others perceive your role?
  * Are you empowered to convene and guide? If not, what would make that possible?
  * Do others understand your endeavor to increase alignment? If not, how can this be made more transparent? Do you need sponsorship from anyone?
  * What could clarify your intention so others can support your interventions?

## Convening

* Intention - Create or strengthen group into "we". Align around shared vision. Converge on shared view where we are right now.
* Consider synchronous meeting vs asynchronous document/text based communication.
* How can you share your perspective in a neutral and affirming way that enables others to buy in?
  * Avoid assigning blame for misalignment.
  * Propose your understanding as your understanding, and invite input.
  * Appreciatively receive the input you are given.
  * Use the "we" voice, ie "we are out of alignment" as opposed to "you and they" or "us and them"
