# MIT: Making Connections

# Module 1: Connect

* Communicate: designing generative dialogue spaces based on community focused storytelling. Focus on images to enhance clarity and memory. Explore different perspectives together in a playful way

# Module 2: Communicate

* Each discussion group is a system: holistic, interconnected, always changing, pattern-dependent, expanding & contracting
* Meeting best practices:
  * Start meetings with grounding in purpose/intention, explain any process, describe what participants are invited to do, and also how these goals relate to broader context.
  * Check-in with each discussion participant at the beginning as a way to invite them to bring their whole self, and shift focus to this new context.
  * Generative Activities - produce ideas, insights and concepts. Can inspire/motivate crativity. Elicit memories, evoke emotions/feelings, and express relationships.

* Goal Process:
