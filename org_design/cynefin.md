# Cynefin

* We often assume causality is determinable and therefore that options can be eliminated.
* Instead of predicting the future, we move to control the future.
* Ordered systems have determinable cause and effect, unordered systems do not.
* Simple ordered systems have causality that is obvious from experience.
* Complicated ordered systems have causality that can be determined by analysis, which means determination of cause is separated by time.
* Ordered systems could be taken apart, and put back together again (ie a car or airplane). Unordered systems can never be deconstructed and put pack together (ie mayonnaise).
* Complex unordered systems are stable and dispositional, or disposed to move or evolve in a certain direction, no amount of analysis will allow prediction and causality can only be determined in hindsight.
* Chaotic unordered systems are unstable, with few constraints, and random behavior.
* As yet undetermined systems are disordered.
* Systems are not always stable and the state may change over time.

## Framework

* Obvious (known knowns) - We know what we are doing and have seen it many times, so we sense, categorize, and respond (S-C-R). We employ best practices.
* Complicated (known unknowns) - We don't know what is going on, but we can analyse what has happened and work it out, so we sense, analyze, and respond (S-A-R). We employ good practice.
* Complex (unknown unknowns) - We cannot determine the cause of particular outcomes, but we can experiment to see if we are trending in the right direction, so we probe, sense, and respond (P-S-R). With no single right or wrong answer, we may want to run a number of experiments in parallel or series. We employ emergent practice.
* Chaotic (unknownable unknowns) - The system is unstable, but it is not viable to wait, so we act (do something), sense, and  respond (A-S-R). We employ novel practice.
* Disorder (not determined) - We have not yet determined the domain.
* Note: most transitions between domains can happen smoothly, but there is a cliff between obvious and chaotic that can be tripped over through complacency, which is very difficult to recover from.

## Determining Domains

* First differentiate between order and un-order. Have we seen this before and/or is there experience that can be leveraged? If so it is ordered. If it is truly novel, then we may need to explore it. If so it is unordered.
* If there is no time to consider further, consider the worst case, rather that the most simple. ie if it is ordered, treat it as complicated and engage experts, and if it is unordered, treat it as chaotic and attempt to stabilize.

## Challenges

* The challenge with experts in the complicated domain is a tendency toward groupthink. This can be countered by engaging a diverse set of individuals with other domains of expertise to include naive views.
* In the complex domain there will be many hypotheses, so aim to run parallel experiments to test hypotheses and maximise the potential for learning. Naivety again has a role as we cannoct know what will happen. As long as someone can make a coherent argument, their idea has value and should be explored.
* Finally, there is value to obliquity, which is the practice of achieving objectives indirectly.

## Narrative Inquiry Practice

* Use anecdotes, informal stories that reflect what actually happens versus what people would like to happen, to establish the issue and help make sense of what is happening.
* Provides an oblique means of investigation by avoiding asking direct questions and has wide applicability.
* Can exploit self-signification of stories, guarding against bias and supporting disintermediation.
* Anecdote circles bring together 7-12 people and ask an oblique question such as "If a friend was looking to join the company, what would you tell them about the organization?"
* Facilitators may need to prompt them to expand, but should avaid asking direct questions.
* Finally, participants are asked to reflect on what they talked about to self-signify and help establsh issues or points of interest raised by anecdotes.

## Contextualization Practice

* Establish issues that exist in this environment and how they relate to create a checkpoint and decide what we want to do.
* Supports building shared context and purpose within an organization.

* Abductive logic - Based on a hunch, we believe this is the case.
* Inductive logic - Based on a small sample, we believe this is the general case.
* Deductive logic - We have a large number of examples and we believe this is the general case.
* Most external agents can apply deductive and inductive reasoning, but abductive logic requires deep understanding of the domain.

* Gather 7-12 people and proceed with four tables, four corners, or linear contextualization.
* Four corners: start with large, blank paper or wall. Put an exemplar, or sample narrative, of each of the four core Cynefin domains in each corner.
* Obvious - Seen before and know what to do. Complicated - Know someone who could work it out with analysis. Complex - There are competing hypothesis. Chaos - There is no structure and everything is chaotic.
* Each issue should be written on a small piece of paper and placed where they sit between exemplars. There is no right or wrong position, it should be based on individual opinion. Be sure to position not only between two exemplars, but among all four. Note that issues should never be placed directly on a corner.
* After placing issues, draw domain boundaries, defined by where issues have been grouped. If people cannot agree which side of a boundary an issue sits on, consider if the issue could be split up.
* The borders give us contextualized issues to work on, but also keep an ear open for (oblique) insights from this exercise, which are instances of abductive logic.

## Initiative Portfolio

* Ideas may not have strong justification, but as long as there is a coheret argument it should be considered.
* Utilize safe-to-fail experiments to determine how we want to evolve the system.
* We should seek to create a diverse portfolio of different experiments.
* A valuable first step may be small experiments to pre-qualify and balance portfolio options. This validates initiatives before large commitment/expenditure, helps clarify success criteria, and allows exploration of many more ideas.
* Facilitator should leave people to learn by doing, providing as little guidance as possible, to prevent introducing bias.
* We are not trying to determine if a hypothesis is correct, only if there is enough coherence to support an experiment. ie we are looking to maximize learning and invalidate ideas, not substantiate them.

* Obvious - Just do it as it has been done.
* Complicated - Gather experts to undertake analysis. Remember to engage related experts to increase diversity and provide naive views.
* Complex - Undertake a series of experiments to see if we can move in a desired direction.
* Chaotic - Not normally encountered during planning, as this dynamic state doesn't exist for long. Propose an action and go from there, seeking to push the problem into complex or complicated domains so we can handle it.

## Ritualized Dissent Practice

* Used to review and validate initiatives, which is something most organizations are not good at.
* Ensures initiative is well formed and has been objectively reviewed before presently to management for sponsorship.
* Goal of reviewers is NOT to reject proposoals, which is the prerogative of management, but to improve them.
* We can ask people what would need to be true to support a hypothesis, which moves them away from thinking of barriers and focuses on what we need to invalidate an idea (which is the opposite of what it would take for it to be true).
* Presenter has a few minutes to outline their initiative, during which no other person speaks. After this they disengage by hiding their face (donning a mask or turning their back).
* Group members now express their views of the idea, particularly what is wrong with it, and shold not hold back in an effort to cover all aspects (devil's advocacy). Each person should speak uninterrupted until they have voiced all their concerns.
* During this the presenter takes notes for consideration in revisions, we are trying to ensure the initiative is viewed objectively and the individual is not involved.
* When finished, the presenter takes the idea back to the original group or goes off to revise based on input.

## Transitioning Between Domains

* We want to move from exploitation to exploration:
  * We have encountered a messy problem and would benefit from treating it as complex and using probes to see if we can move it in a desirable direction.
  * If there are competing hypotheses, we should explore all of them, so the path from complicated into complex may spit into multiple paths of exploration.
  * The resulting series of safe-to-fail probes then lead to a series of options which may be exploited in an ordered domain.
* We want to increase organizational agility (rate of change):
  * We are looking to enter a shallow dive through chaos to invoke a change of direction.
  * Start by creating a crisis, or letting one develop.
  * Then contain this chaotic element and look to move out of this domain as quickly as possible.
  * This can be used to explore what direction we want to take, after which complex domain practices can be used to explore competing hypothesis.

# Cynefin (Greg Brougham)

## Limits of rationality

- When we are faced with a problem, we assume that all we need to do is elaborate the options, select one, and then execute. This assumes that causality is determinable and therefore that we have a valid means of eliminating options.
- This is not always the case and we need to acknowledge that there are systems in which we can determine cause and effect and those in which we cannot. We call the former ordered and the later un-ordered1 systems
- In an ordered system, the system is highly constrained, the behaviour is highly predictable, and the causality is either obvious from experience or can be determined by analysis. If the cause is obvious then we have a simple system, and if it is not obvious but can be determined by analysis, we say it is a complicated system as cause and effect (or determination of the cause) is separated by time.
- For an un-ordered system, we cannot determine causality.
- However, we find that some of these systems are stable, and the constraints and behaviour evolve over time through the interaction of the components. They are dispositional in nature — that is, they are disposed to move or evolve in a certain direction — but causality can only be determined in hindsight, and no amount of analysis will allow us to predict the behaviour of the system. This domain, we call complex.
- But there are also some systems that are not stable and which we can only described as chaotic: there are few to no constraints, and behaviour is random.
- There is one additional domain that needs to be considered: systems that we have not yet determined — we put these in the “disorder” bucket.
- We can apply another definition to systems that are ordered as we can take them apart and put back together again — for example, a car or an aeroplane; those that are un-ordered can never be deconstructed then put back together. For example, think of making mayonnaise.
- We also need to acknowledge that systems are not always stable and the state of the system may change over time.

## The Cynefin framework

- Obvious (known knowns): Here, we know what we are doing and have seen it a thousand times before, so we sense, categorise, and respond (S-C-R). We expect to see best practices employed.
- Complicated (known unknowns): We don’t know what is going on but we know that we can analyse what has happened and work it out, so we sense, analyse, and respond (S-A-R). This is the domain of good practice.
- Complex (unknown unknowns): We cannot determine what will cause a particular outcome but we can run some experiments to see if they move us in the right direction, so we probe, sense, and respond (P-S-R). This is also the domain of multiple hypotheses: there is no right or wrong answer, so we may want to run a series of experiments or run a number in parallel. This is the domain of emergent practice.
- Chaotic (unknowable unknowns): Here, the system is not stable but we need to do something as it is not viable to wait, so we act (do something), sense, and respond (A-S-R). This is the domain of novel practice.
- Disorder (not determined): These are the items whose domain we have yet to determine.

- The first thing we need to do is to differentiate between order and un-order: have we seen this before or have any experience that can be leveraged? If so, then the problem is ordered. If we haven’t seen this before and it is truly novel, then this is something that we may be better off exploring first; therefore, we treat it as un-ordered.
- If there is no time to consider the domain in which we are operating, then we should consider the worst case, not the most simple — which means that if is ordered, then deal with it as complicated and engage experts and if it is un-ordered, then treat it as chaotic and act in an attempt to stabilise the situation.
- The issue with the complicated domain, the domain of experts, is that there is a tendency towards groupthink.
- The issue of groupthink can be addressed by engaging diverse groups of individuals and ensuring that some of these come from other domains of expertise and therefore provide a naive view.
- Multi-hypotheses: We have talked about there being no clear answer in the complex domain, which means that we will have competing views.
- The complex domain is the domain of multi-hypotheses, so aim to run a number of parallel experiments that test these hypotheses and maximise the potential for learning.
- Again, naivety has a role to play as we cannot assume that we know what will happen. As long as someone can make a coherent argument, their idea has value and should be explored.
- Obliquity: The last point to make is that of the need to recognise the value of obliquity, which is the practice of achieving objectives indirectly.
- What we ideally want to use is an oblique approach, as this avoids the cognitive bias that comes from using a traditional measure that can be gamed. This is explored in John Kay’s excellent Obliquity: Why Our Goals Are Best Achieved Indirectly.
- Cynefin provides an approach and a set of practices for addressing the uncertainty that increasingly faces management today. It provides them with the means to realise that they are facing a messy, intractable problem and with the tools to enable them to make progress in this imperfect world.
- Instead of obsessing about predicting the future, we can move to controlling the future, and we therefore don’t need to predict everything.

## Cynefin and narrative

- Anecdotes are informal stories that reflect what actually happens versus what people would like to happen.
- The practice of narrative enquiry is the use of anecdotes to establish the issues and to help make sense of what is happening.
- Narrative enquiry is an oblique means of investigation and has wide applicability.
- It is an oblique technique as the user is not asked direct questions, which ensures more openness and honesty.
- A second advantage of narrative enquiry is that it can exploit self-signification of the stories, which guards against the facilitators or other parties biasing the results (this supports the principle of disintermediation).
- In a traditional analysis approach, once we have conducted one or two interviews, human biases come into play as we start to look for stories or requirements that confirm the themes that we are seeing (this is confirmation bias at work).
- The use of stories allows people to access thoughts and feelings that are otherwise not available to them. This is because some knowledge is tacit in nature, meaning that a person doesn’t know it until they need it (Polanyi, 2009).
- Cognitive Edge’s approach to this at the group level is the use of anecdote circles,
- At the group level, we need to consider the dynamics, and groups should be seven to twelve members large (see the “Shared context and sense making” section for a discussion of group sizes). In addition, we ideally want to record the conversation and transcribe it.
- We engage at the individual level with an oblique question such as “If a friend was looking to join the company, what would you tell them about the organisation?”
- We may need to prompt them to expand on their answers, but we avoid asking direct questions about the challenges and the good or bad.
- As part of the session, we also need to ask them to reflect on what they talked about.
- This reflection is the self-signification element and helps to establish the issues or points of interest that the anecdotes have raised.
- The Cynefin framework can be used in different ways: for categorisation, which is useful from a situational perspective; for contextualisation, which is useful in establishing a checkpoint and deciding what we want to do; and from a dynamics perspective – we are here and need to move to here, so this the journey that we need to consider.
- Contextualisation is one of the most useful Cynefin practices as it supports building shared context and purpose within an organisation.

## Contextualisation

- Abductive logic — Based on a hunch, we believe this is the case.
- Inductive logic — Based on a small sample, we believe this is the general case.
- Deductive logic — We have a large number of examples and we believe this is the general case.
- Not everything is based on analysis, which is an underlying theme in Cynefin.
- Most external agents can apply deductive and inductive reasoning to a problem, but abductive logic requires deep understanding of the domain.

## Shared context

- A shared context is developed by contextualisation — that is, establishing the issues that exist in this environment and how they relate. We are using Cynefin to develop this understanding of the issues so we are assuming that we are largely aware of the issues; there may be an issue log or list of questions that we are looking to make sense of.
- Remember that diversity and naivety are key tenets of Cynefin, so it is desirable to engage other parties as they bring different perspectives to bear.
- The ideal group size for this exercise is seven to twelve.4 Nancy Kline (1999) mentions that twelve is as large a group as we want, as this is the size of group in which people are still comfortable expressing themselves. Similarly, we don’t want a lot of small groups as we want to encourage diversity; don’t form groups any smaller than seven members as a general rule.
- There are three approaches that we can use to support contextualisation: four tables, four corners, or linear.
- Of these, I prefer four corners.
  - In the four-corners method, we start out with a large, blank piece of paper or a wall.
  - In each of the four corners, we place an exemplar, a sample narrative, of each of the four core domains of the Cynefin framework
  - Obvious — Have seen it before and you know what to do. Complicated — Know someone who could work it out with some analysis. Complex — There are competing hypothesis about what is happening. Chaos — There is no structure and everything is chaotic.
  - The process is to write each issue on a small piece of paper (for example, Post-it notes) and then place these on the piece of paper one at a time based on where they sit between the exemplars.
  - There is no right or wrong position for an issue, as the placement should be based on the individual’s opinion of where each sits relative to the exemplars
  - Issues fit not only between any two of the exemplars but among all four.
  - We are emplying an oblique practice here, so although we are looking at developing a shared understanding of the issues that we face, we are also managing for emergence and insights that may help establish the direction in which people want to progress.
  - Position the issues on the wall based on association with the exemplars. This is not an absolute position but based on how we think each issue relates to each of the exemplar narratives. I must stress that we should not allow people to place an issue directly on any corner
  - After placing all the issues, we want to draw the domain boundaries, which are defined by where the issues have been grouped.
  - If people cannot agree whether an issue sits on one side of a boundary or other, then we ask them to consider if there are in fact two issues, and whether they could be split into two with one placed inside either associated domain.
  - The borders give us a set of contextualised issues that we can start to work on. Remember to keep an ear open for insights that come out of this exercise, which are instances of abductive logic.
  - The next phase is the development of a series of initiatives that start to address the key issues that we have identified, embracing the insights that have come out of the exercise.
  - Remember that there may not be a strong justification for an idea, but as long as there is a coherent argument it should be considered.
- One of the core ideas of Cynefin is the use of safe-to-fail experiments to determine how we want to evolve the system.
- Since another of Cynefin’s key tenets is the exploration of multi-hypotheses, and there will be a number of experiments and portfolio forms to control these tests.
- An alternative view holds that these small experiments should serve to pre-qualify the portfolio options and ensure that there is a balance to the portfolio.
- This has a number of advantages — the first being that it validates initiatives before there is any large commitment or expenditure.
- It also clarifies what constitutes success and allows exploration of multiple ideas when this traditionally could not be accommodated.
- Additionally, it allows for the development of a balanced portfolio that can deliver some business value, and is not only focused on hygiene-driven change such as system maintenance, upgrades, or regulatory or legislative change.
- The facilitator must leave the people to learn by doing, providing as little guidance as possible, so that they express their own views and the facilitator does not bias the outcomes.
- Once a number of people have exposure to these practices, they can perform them with no external facilitation in an on-going basis.
- We are not trying to establish if a hypothesis is right or wrong, only that there is enough coherence to support an experiment.
- We are looking to maximise learning and invalidate an idea, not substantiate an idea.
- You will recall from the first section that complex systems are dispositional in nature, meaning that they are disposed to move or evolve in a certain direction, but we cannot determine causality so the only way we can manage this type of system is by probing, sensing, and responding. That is, we run a series of experiments to see if we can move the system in a direction that is desirable or beneficial to us.
- In the complicated domain, in comparison, we manage by sensing, analysing, and responding. Here, we are looking for someone or a group of people who could determine what is desirable based on sensing and analysing the environment.
- In summary, this is how we approach the initiatives in each of the domains once they are identified:
  - Obvious — Just do it, as you have seen it before and it should be obvious what needs to be done (this is after all the criterion for it being classified as obvious). It should just be a case of what resources are needed and whether you have them.3
  - Complicated — You need to involve a group of experts or knowledgeable individuals to undertake the analysis. Remember to engage related experts to honour the principle of requisite diversity and to bring naive views to bear to avoid groupthink.
  - Complex — What are the viable (that is, coherent) hypotheses and therefore what are the experiments that we are proposing? Remember, this is the domain of messy coherence and therefore we cannot predict the outcome, so we need to undertake a series of experiments to see if we can move in a desired direction (this being where you want to move or at least start to progress towards).
  - Chaotic — This is not often encountered during planning as this is normally a dynamic state that doesn’t exist for long. We want to do something to move the problem into the complex or complicated domain so that we can start to get a handle on it.4 Remember, we approach this domain based on act-sense-respond, so someone just needs to propose an action and then we go from there.
- The Cynefin practice of ritualised dissent is used here to review and validate the initiatives and this is something that most organisations are not good at.
- The ideas behind the practice are similar to neuroscientist Vincent Walsh’s idea of trashing, in which a proposal is rigorously critiqued to ensure that it is fully formed. This practice ensures an objective review of the idea and removes the subjectivity.
- Complicated portfolio template
- These can be acknowledged experts from other areas of the organisation that would typically not be engaged or they could be external agents.
- To improve information scanning, we want to ensure requisite diversity by engaging people who are not familiar with the domain.

## Complex portfolio template

- This is the domain of multi-hypotheses so we expect there to be more than one by the nature of the domain. Remember that any idea that appears coherent may have value and should be evaluated.
- The objective is not to determine what should be done but what probes (experiments) would help clarify the situation.
- Portfolio initiatives review
  - If we have the opportunity, we can ask people what would need to be true to support the hypothesis. This moves them away from thinking of barriers and allows us to start looking at what we need to invalidate an idea, as these are just the opposites of what it would take for it to be true.
  - The presenter has a few minutes to outline the initiative during which no other person is allowed to speak.
  - Once finished, the presenter disengages from the group by hiding their face — donning a mask, if available, or turning their chair so that their back faces the group.
  - The group members may now express their views of the idea, particularly what is wrong with it, and they should not hold back as this is about ensuring that all aspects are covered.
  - Again, this is not a debating forum so only one person at a time should speak until each has voiced all their concerns
  - During this, the presenter takes notes of the points raised for consideration in a revision of the initiative. We are trying to ensure that the initiative is reviewed objectively and the individual is not involved.
  - When the group has finished expressing concerns, the presenter takes the ideas back to the original group or goes off to revise the proposal to address the points that have been made.
  - This simple practice takes advantage of the expertise and knowledge of the organisation to ensure that any initiative is well formed and has been objectively reviewed before presenting it to management for sponsorship.
  - It is not the function of the reviewers to reject proposals, which is the prerogative of management, but to improve them.

## Portfolio management

- The outcome of the initiative review is likely to be a series of robust initiatives that should be considered for implementation.
- We may have to address a series of strategic themes, business priorities, and ensure that the initiatives are balanced and not biased towards one particular area. Also, if we are dealing with complex issues, we want to have multiple initiatives. In the complicated domain, it may be more straightforward as there is likely to be only a single initiative within a theme, but there may be multiple competing ideas from different teams or areas of the business, and we should explore these. These are only elements that need to be considered as part of each organisation’s approach to exploiting Cynefin.

## Cynefin dynamics

- This gives rise to two situations where moving between domains is of value: one where we want to move from exploitation to exploration and the other where we want to increase the organisational agility (rate of change).
- In the first case (marked A in the diagram above), we have encountered a problem that is messy in nature.2 We may or may not realise that this is complex in nature but we would benefit from dealing with it as complex as we can use probes to see if we can move the situation in a desirable direction.
- If there are competing hypotheses, we should explore all of them, so the path from complicated into complex may split into multiple paths of exploration.
- The resulting series of safe-to-fail probes will then lead to a series of options that may be then exploited in an ordered domain.
- In the second case (B), where we want to create a change in an organisation, we can move the issue intentionally (or let it collapse) into a chaotic state.
- This is more a challenging art than a science, but we are looking to enter a shallow dive through chaos to invoke a change of direction for the organisation.
- The first step is creating the crisis or letting it develop, and this is not addressed here.
- The thing to realise is that the chaotic element needs to be contained and we need to look to move out of this domain as quickly as possible.
- What I find useful is to use this to explore the direction that we want to take and then use complex domain practices to explore the competing hypotheses.
