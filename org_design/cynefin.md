# Cynefin

* We often assume causality is determinable and therefore that options can be eliminated.
* Instead of predicting the future, we move to control the future.
* Ordered systems have determinable cause and effect, unordered systems do not.
* Simple ordered systems have causality that is obvious from experience.
* Complicated ordered systems have causality that can be determined by analysis, which means determination of cause is separated by time.
* Ordered systems could be taken apart, and put back together again (ie a car or airplane). Unordered systems can never be deconstructed and put pack together (ie mayonnaise).
* Complex unordered systems are stable and dispositional, or disposed to move or evolve in a certain direction, no amount of analysis will allow prediction and causality can only be determined in hindsight.
* Chaotic unordered systems are unstable, with few constraints, and random behavior.
* As yet undetermined systems are disordered.
* Systems are not always stable and the state may change over time.

## Framework

* Obvious (known knowns) - We know what we are doing and have seen it many times, so we sense, categorize, and respond (S-C-R). We employ best practices.
* Complicated (known unknowns) - We don't know what is going on, but we can analyse what has happened and work it out, so we sense, analyze, and respond (S-A-R). We employ good practice.
* Complex (unknown unknowns) - We cannot determine the cause of particular outcomes, but we can experiment to see if we are trending in the right direction, so we probe, sense, and respond (P-S-R). With no single right or wrong answer, we may want to run a number of experiments in parallel or series. We employ emergent practice.
* Chaotic (unknownable unknowns) - The system is unstable, but it is not viable to wait, so we act (do something), sense, and  respond (A-S-R). We employ novel practice.
* Disorder (not determined) - We have not yet determined the domain.
* Note: most transitions between domains can happen smoothly, but there is a cliff between obvious and chaotic that can be tripped over through complacency, which is very difficult to recover from.

## Determining Domains

* First differentiate between order and un-order. Have we seen this before and/or is there experience that can be leveraged? If so it is ordered. If it is truly novel, then we may need to explore it. If so it is unordered.
* If there is no time to consider further, consider the worst case, rather that the most simple. ie if it is ordered, treat it as complicated and engage experts, and if it is unordered, treat it as chaotic and attempt to stabilize.

## Challenges

* The challenge with experts in the complicated domain is a tendency toward groupthink. This can be countered by engaging a diverse set of individuals with other domains of expertise to include naive views.
* In the complex domain there will be many hypotheses, so aim to run parallel experiments to test hypotheses and maximise the potential for learning. Naivety again has a role as we cannoct know what will happen. As long as someone can make a coherent argument, their idea has value and should be explored.
* Finally, there is value to obliquity, which is the practice of achieving objectives indirectly.

## Narrative Inquiry Practice

* Use anecdotes, informal stories that reflect what actually happens versus what people would like to happen, to establish the issue and help make sense of what is happening.
* Provides an oblique means of investigation by avoiding asking direct questions and has wide applicability.
* Can exploit self-signification of stories, guarding against bias and supporting disintermediation.
* Anecdote circles bring together 7-12 people and ask an oblique question such as "If a friend was looking to join the company, what would you tell them about the organization?"
* Facilitators may need to prompt them to expand, but should avaid asking direct questions.
* Finally, participants are asked to reflect on what they talked about to self-signify and help establsh issues or points of interest raised by anecdotes.

## Contextualization Practice

* Establish issues that exist in this environment and how they relate to create a checkpoint and decide what we want to do.
* Supports building shared context and purpose within an organization.

* Abductive logic - Based on a hunch, we believe this is the case.
* Inductive logic - Based on a small sample, we believe this is the general case.
* Deductive logic - We have a large number of examples and we believe this is the general case.
* Most external agents can apply deductive and inductive reasoning, but abductive logic requires deep understanding of the domain.

* Gather 7-12 people and proceed with four tables, four corners, or linear contextualization.
* Four corners: start with large, blank paper or wall. Put an exemplar, or sample narrative, of each of the four core Cynefin domains in each corner.
* Obvious - Seen before and know what to do. Complicated - Know someone who could work it out with analysis. Complex - There are competing hypothesis. Chaos - There is no structure and everything is chaotic.
* Each issue should be written on a small piece of paper and placed where they sit between exemplars. There is no right or wrong position, it should be based on individual opinion. Be sure to position not only between two exemplars, but among all four. Note that issues should never be placed directly on a corner.
* After placing issues, draw domain boundaries, defined by where issues have been grouped. If people cannot agree which side of a boundary an issue sits on, consider if the issue could be split up.
* The borders give us contextualized issues to work on, but also keep an ear open for (oblique) insights from this exercise, which are instances of abductive logic.

## Initiative Portfolio

* Ideas may not have strong justification, but as long as there is a coheret argument it should be considered.
* Utilize safe-to-fail experiments to determine how we want to evolve the system.
* We should seek to create a diverse portfolio of different experiments.
* A valuable first step may be small experiments to pre-qualify and balance portfolio options. This validates initiatives before large commitment/expenditure, helps clarify success criteria, and allows exploration of many more ideas.
* Facilitator should leave people to learn by doing, providing as little guidance as possible, to prevent introducing bias.
* We are not trying to determine if a hypothesis is correct, only if there is enough coherence to support an experiment. ie we are looking to maximize learning and invalidate ideas, not substantiate them.

* Obvious - Just do it as it has been done.
* Complicated - Gather experts to undertake analysis. Remember to engage related experts to increase diversity and provide naive views.
* Complex - Undertake a series of experiments to see if we can move in a desired direction.
* Chaotic - Not normally encountered during planning, as this dynamic state doesn't exist for long. Propose an action and go from there, seeking to push the problem into complex or complicated domains so we can handle it.

## Ritualized Dissent Practice

* Used to review and validate initiatives, which is something most organizations are not good at.
* Ensures initiative is well formed and has been objectively reviewed before presently to management for sponsorship.
* Goal of reviewers is NOT to reject proposoals, which is the prerogative of management, but to improve them.
* We can ask people what would need to be true to support a hypothesis, which moves them away from thinking of barriers and focuses on what we need to invalidate an idea (which is the opposite of what it would take for it to be true).
* Presenter has a few minutes to outline their initiative, during which no other person speaks. After this they disengage by hiding their face (donning a mask or turning their back).
* Group members now express their views of the idea, particularly what is wrong with it, and shold not hold back in an effort to cover all aspects (devil's advocacy). Each person should speak uninterrupted until they have voiced all their concerns.
* During this the presenter takes notes for consideration in revisions, we are trying to ensure the initiative is viewed objectively and the individual is not involved.
* When finished, the presenter takes the idea back to the original group or goes off to revise based on input.

## Transitioning Between Domains

* We want to move from exploitation to exploration:
  * We have encountered a messy problem and would benefit from treating it as complex and using probes to see if we can move it in a desirable direction.
  * If there are competing hypotheses, we should explore all of them, so the path from complicated into complex may spit into multiple paths of exploration.
  * The resulting series of safe-to-fail probes then lead to a series of options which may be exploited in an ordered domain.
* We want to increase organizational agility (rate of change):
  * We are looking to enter a shallow dive through chaos to invoke a change of direction.
  * Start by creating a crisis, or letting one develop.
  * Then contain this chaotic element and look to move out of this domain as quickly as possible.
  * This can be used to explore what direction we want to take, after which complex domain practices can be used to explore competing hypothesis.
