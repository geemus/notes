# The Power of Stories to Fuel Innovation

* Stories: move us, teach us, provide an escape, pass tradition, orient us, and define us.
* Stories bring an audience through a journey of connected beginning, middle, and end (though not necessarilly in that order).
* Tactical stories serve a single purpose: illiciting a laugh, instructing, making someone feel better, etc.
* Strategic stories define the essence of something, explaining not just what you is being done, but also why.
* Effective stories provide 2 + 2, but let the listener get to 4 on their own.
* You are rarely the hero, the audience is. Show them how you or your brand can be it's tool.

## Why Stories?

* Stories drive clarity, culture, connection, stickiness, and leadership.
* Story is everywhere. It is as much a way of life as a skill. Spend time learning other stories (to better meet other's needs) and noticing your own. Bank stories.
* Effective stories create a participatory environment with a single focused goal, attention grabbing, engaging story, and enabled action. Seek to transition from advocate to ambassador, by creating contexts that empower the right kinds of stories to occur.
* Creating personal connection makes a story memorable; if it creates real emotion, makes your jaw drop, or is a provocative question, it will get shared. This translates to growth.

* Physiologically - provide a framework for the brain to organize information.
* Psychologically - make people care by helping them see themselves in the story.
* Increase Memory - up to 22x more memorable than facts alone.
* Hold Attention - help hold attention beyond usual drift every ~7 minutes.
* Compassion - "let me tell you a story" slows people down to listen harder, and open up.
* Behavior - Brands described in narrative are evaluated more favorably (vs a feature list), and customers are more likely to buy from brands whose story they believe and resonate with.

## Powerful, Effective Stories

1. Single-Focused Goal - Develop a clear, single, focused goal. There is elegance in simplicity.
  * Human2Human - Focus on who you want to help, rather than jumping to solutions.
  * Actionable - What action must one take to address audience need?
  * Happiness - Ensure the goal is personally meaningful and would bring happiness to you and the audience in some way.
  * Measurable - Identify metrics to help evaluate success/failure. Establish deadlines, celebrate small wins, etc.
  * Clarity - Keep goals focused to increase odds of success and generate momentum. Start with simplest behavior to change at a low cost.
  * Journey - Understand where your audience is now, and where they should be after. What journey should the audience take, and what do you want them to think, feel, or do?
2. Grab Attention - Reverse the rules to grab attention.
  * Hook - What catches you and draws you in? Is it exciting (something you would talk about), engaging (part of the stories of your life), innovative (new things keep happening), enthusiastic (creating differentiated experience), etc
  * Personal - What makes the hook personally resonant?
  * Tone - Pay attention to not just what you say, but also how you say it.
  * Unexpected - People like consuming and sharing new info. Pique their curiosity. Look to reframe the familiar.
  * Visual - Show, don't tell. Photos and videos speak millions of words in seconds.
  * Visceral - Speak to all the senses - sight, sound, hearing or taste.
  * S.T.A.R. - What is the S.T.A.R. (Something They'll Always Remember), the defining moment that people will talk about.
3. Engage - Tell a good (truthful) story.
  * Protagonist - Should be someone knowable and relatable.
  * Arc - Chronology doesn't matter, as long as it has an interesting pattern (like a roller coaster).
  * Credibility - Mix fact and emotion, you can emphasize one or the other, but take care to maintain some balance.
  * Conclusions - The audience will pay closer attention and feel respected if you let them draw their own conclusions.
  * Memorable Story - Find compelling, sticky stories to convey critical information. Less is more, let customers connect the dots. Make sure the protagonist is on a journey.
  * Customer Hero - You and your brand are not the heroes. Your brand helps the customer, the real hero, achieve something. It's that simple.
  * Empathy - As you engage, let your audience engage you. What is important to them? How does that relate to your campaign.
  * Authenticity - True passion is contagious. The more authentic you are, the easier it will be for others to connect with you and your cause. Build common ground by sharing values and beliefs.
4. Enable - Enable others to contribute and choose their own weapon.
  * Co-create - Stories are richer if you enable customers to be a part of them.
  * Share - Design stories for sharability. ie why would someone want to retell? Will they look smart, is it funny, does it spread awe?
  * Vary - Stories should span channels (traditional, hybrid, social, owned), and be retold in the most appropriate way for each channel.
  * Ease - Make it easy for others to act. Prioritize calls to action. Campaigns will be more successful if people understand what you need and can take simple immediate action.
  * Fun - Consider game play, competition, humor, and rewards. Can you engage competitive spirit? Can you make them feel like a kid again.
  * Idiosyncratic - People like programs they perceive are tailored to them (ie speak to their interests) or where they are uniquely advantaged to do well and can have disproportionate impact.
  * Enable - No one should have to ask permission to act. Provide a frame to work within - your point of view and story - and empower them to brieng their effort and unique talents and surprise you.

## Effective Storytelling

* How to coach storytelling:
  * Be curious: Start with open ended questions. Seek to understand what they are trying to communicate, rather than jumping to conclusions. If there are gaps between their intention and your understanding, work together to close them.
  * Don't judge: Look for what you connect with, and build on that.
  * Give thoughtful feedback: Demonstrate attention and interest with thoughtful comments or questions. Mention parts of the story that resonate. Check if you caught the "a ha" moments. Suggest delivery methods that could help audiences further connect.
* How to storyteller's act:
  * Practice "one person/one thought" - make sustained eye contact with an individual (or section of room) while finishing a complete thought, then pick another and repeat.
  * Focus on your presence - What you say is just as important as how you say it, so pay attention to ensure your physical presence matches the emotions you are trying to express.
  * Engage - Involving someone in something active (planting a seed they can return to and watch grow) is far better than giving them something to read. Actively engaged is more likely to be deeply engaged, no matter how small the initial act.

## Banking Stories

* Story is a mindset. The more you think about and share stories, the better you will become at this, so look for opportunities (even outside work). Also ask others for stories to help them get better at it, feel more connected, and contextualize bad events.
* Stories are assets, so you should actively collect them. As you gather stories, think about who you would tell each story to, and when.
* Your stories determine your image and allow you to convey they image you want. Other's stories help us understand how to better meet their needs, sell, and persuade.
* Focus on banking stories which are: True, Bold, Distinct, Relevant, Memorable, Evergreen, and/or Legacy.
* Reflection - Use different techniques to prompt your recollection of stories. Think about stories associated with key people, places or times. Conjure specific emotions and capture stories that come to mind.
* Tracking - As you find a compelling story, write it down. Keep a journal with you or spend time at the end of the day writing down key moments. Write down titles, storyboard structures, and describe how/why to use a story.
* Banking process: brainstorm, iterate, share, edit, bank.
* Story themes: need/action, insight/conflict, POV/solution/event

## Stories as Marketing

* Provides new ways to engage with customers and invite them to be part of your team.
* We need to hear something 3-5 times to overcome skepticism, so create and curate stories worth sharing (the more it is shared, the more people will see it). Also reiterate the story in ways customized to different channels/formats.
* Think about narratives (which don't have an arc/end) and can be populated with many stories.

## Storytelling in Business

* Identify Signature Stories - strategic assets which merit active management
  * Impact and Revenue - can be driven through customer intimacy, operational excellence, innovation, etc.
  * Growth and Innovation - innovation requires new, compelling, and inspiring stories. But you have to bring others along. Stories help employees and customers jump to where you are going by explaining where you are going and why.
  * Trust and Leadership - words seek to cultivate trust, but actions determine it (and can be captured/shared in stories). Stories disproportionately determine the reputation of cultures and leaders.
* Pick the right hero: Brands too often try to be the hero, when the customer should be the hero. Understand their goals and how you will move them along their journey.
* Ensure the story is coherent: how does where you are headed relate to where you came from, and how is this consistent and coherent.
* Stories are a mindset - Cultivate stories, seek connection, and take risks instead of to-dos, hitting numbers, etc
  * Create forums to share stories, and a culture here story is revered. Listen closely, document, and share the stories you hear.
  * Stories are about laughing at mistakes, taking risks, (eventual) success, and transformation.
  * Invite narratives in everything from recruiting, values, operations, etc. All practices reinforce the narrative.
  * Start thinking about what is now, what could be, and utilize story to help others bridge the gap between the two.
* Stories can work against you too: To err is human; mistakes are made; crises do happen.
  * Time is not on your side - In crisis, timing is critical. Don't chase the story, ensure you have considered what you want to say before saying it.
  * Credibility is key - Don't provide an instant response that is unsustainable and/or detrimental. Don't rush to spin for short-term gain and long-term loss. Don't lay the blame elsewhere.
  * Be straight - Say what you know, what you don't know, and what you are going to do to fix the problem. Assume everything will eventually get out -- full disclosure is your friend.
  * Speak to your core audience - Identify core audince and determine what information they want to receive. Align communication channels with how this audience receive information. Use core audience to filter out noise and rebuild credibility with the people that matter.
  * Takeaways: Take control of your story, don't let the press write it for you. Prepare for crisis by building credible, honest and authentic brand. Identify key decision makers. Understand your core audience. Internally understand potential crisis and plan ahead -- timing is critical to recovery.

## Stories in Life

* In life there is both signal and noise, stories provide a means to reduce noise.
* Identify Signature Stories - why hire me, and building trust.
* Power of stories:
  * Story shapes how others see you, whether they want to hire you, whether they want to buy from you, etc. What stories do you tell yourself and what stories do others tell about you?
  * Story is a tool of power. When you share stories, people slow down and listen. Listening draws others to share stories. Consider how often you share stories and how often you listen.
  * Story persuades. Motivating stories can be an asset when advocating. Stories are memorable and persuasive. When you use stories to persuade?
* Utilizing signature stories:
  * Know your signature stories: Write down past, present, and future stories. Look for the through line that connects them to understand objectives and motivations.
  * Know when you are making a change, creating a new chapter. Know why you are making that change. Use story to help others understand where you are going.
  * Don't manufacture your story. It needs to be authentic.
  * Stories don't have to be big and epic. Stories live in small moments and can be told briefly.
  * Make others integral to your stories. The story does not have to be yours.
* What stories are others cultivating? Are you listening hard? Can you help them tell their story?
