# Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World

## Simple Rules: 4 Common Traits

* Small number of rules for clear focus and ease of remembering.
* Rules tailored to the particular context.
* Rules apply to a well-defined activity or decision.
* Provide clear guidance while leaving flexibility and autonomy.

## Simple Rules: 3 Strengths

* Avoid rigidity of too many rules and chaos of too few, allowing flexibility in pursuit of new opportunities.
* Quickly make decisions with limited data. Simplicity helps us remember rules, act on them, and stick with them over time.
* Collective action can emerge even when no one member knows the whole context.

## Complex Rules: 2 Strengths

* Detailed rules enhcance efficiency of routine activities (ie checklists, playbooks).
* Complicated models work particularly well with ample data and well understood underlying causal relationships among variables.

## Simple Rules: 6 Types

* Stopping - When to reverse a decision. Helps find a good enough option and/or break away from sunk cost.
* Boundary - What to do (or not do). Can translate broad policies or statistical findings into easy-to-use decision aids.
* Prioritizing - How to rank alternatives competing for scare resources. Helps when too many things meet boundary conditions.
* How-to - Basics of getting things done, without prescribing every detail. Work where the unexpected is expected.
* Coordination - How groups will work togother. Help coordinate over space and time, by relying only on local information.
* Timing - Specify action to take when some trigger occurs. Event pacing links action to events, whereas time pacing links it to a clock or calendar.

## Simple Rules: 4 Formulation Approaches

* Reflection on one's own experience.
* Adopting from experiences of others. Works best when contexts are similar, beware of superficial similarities.
* Distilling from high-quality scientific evidence. Focusing on most consistent findings can allow more comfort in providing unqualified, practical advice.
* Negotiation among stakeholders. Negotiating a fair set of rules across broad choices can help settle continuous issues as they arise.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: 3 Steps to Strategy

* Identify the who, what, and how.
* Identify a bottleneck that is preventing improvement.
* Craft a set of rules that, when applied to the bottleneck, lead to improvements.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: 3 Characteristics of Bottlenecks

* Direct and significant impact on value creation.
* Represent recurrent decisions, allowing testing, refinement, and re-use.
* Arise when opportunities exceed available resources.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: Common Bottlenecks

* The how from a who, what, how analysis often points in the right direction.
* Choosing external partners is often a place where opportunity exceeds capacity.
* Decisions requiring coordination across departments or teams often lead to bottlenecks.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: Developing Rules

* Involve a team in a structured process to get more diverse inputs.
* Include some of the people who will use the rules on a day-to-day basis.
  * They are closest to the facts and best positioned to codify experience into rules.
  * They will have a clearer understanding of the right balance between guidance and discretion.
  * They will be more likely to buy-in to the final rules, and therefore apply them in practice.
  * They will be better positioned to explain the rules and rationale to colleagues who did not participate in the development process.
* Test your rules early and often, then refine them from what you learn.

## Personal Simple Rules

* Personal value is the gap between what brings you the most happiness and what keeps you  from enjoying life to the fullest.
* Focus on what you most want to improve and what you can change to progress.
* Role models can be a good source of rules, but their rules may be implicit.
* If more than one person will be impacted, it is critical for everyone to focus on the same bottleneck.

## Questions for Extracting Implicit Rules
  * Explain your situation and ask what they would do differently.
  * Tease out extremes by asking what they always do or never do.
  * Ask them to walk through recent examples.

## How Rules Improve

* Shift from superficial and convenient rules to strategic and abstract ones that apply over a broader range of activities and decisions. Driven by retrospectives with groups at multiple levels.
* Rules clarify in order of difficulty to learn/discern: Boundary and how-to; prioritizing, timing and coordination; and stopping last.
* Rules go through simplification cycles in which their number grows, then shrinks, and finally becomes constant.

## Breaking Rules

* If new rules are needed, the right choice is often moving to them as quickly as possible.
* Most of us overattribute our success to ourselves rather than circumstance, and conversely underattribute our failures to ourselves.
* Research indicates we learn best when we make accurate attributions.
* Attribution is more likely to be correct when experiences are routinely discussed.

## Conclusion

* Simple rules take a lot of effort to develop.
* Some people benefit from complexity. The costs of complex systems are often distributed, while the benefits are concentrated.
* We fall victim to the "myth of requisite complexity", a mistake belief that complex problems demand complicated solutions.
* Complex rules and regulations often arise out of a distrust of human nature: if people cannot be trusted, detailed regulations prevent malfeasance.
