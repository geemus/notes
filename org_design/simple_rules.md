# Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World

## Simple Rules: 4 Common Traits

* Small number of rules for clear focus and ease of remembering.
* Rules tailored to the particular context.
* Rules apply to a well-defined activity or decision.
* Provide clear guidance while leaving flexibility and autonomy.

## Simple Rules: 3 Strengths

* Avoid rigidity of too many rules and chaos of too few, allowing flexibility in pursuit of new opportunities.
* Quickly make decisions with limited data. Simplicity helps us remember rules, act on them, and stick with them over time.
* Collective action can emerge even when no one member knows the whole context.

## Complex Rules: 2 Strengths

* Detailed rules enhcance efficiency of routine activities (ie checklists, playbooks).
* Complicated models work particularly well with ample data and well understood underlying causal relationships among variables.

## Simple Rules: 6 Types

* Stopping - When to reverse a decision. Helps find a good enough option and/or break away from sunk cost.
* Boundary - What to do (or not do). Can translate broad policies or statistical findings into easy-to-use decision aids.
* Prioritizing - How to rank alternatives competing for scare resources. Helps when too many things meet boundary conditions.
* How-to - Basics of getting things done, without prescribing every detail. Work where the unexpected is expected.
* Coordination - How groups will work togother. Help coordinate over space and time, by relying only on local information.
* Timing - Specify action to take when some trigger occurs. Event pacing links action to events, whereas time pacing links it to a clock or calendar.

## Simple Rules: 4 Formulation Approaches

* Reflection on one's own experience.
* Adopting from experiences of others. Works best when contexts are similar, beware of superficial similarities.
* Distilling from high-quality scientific evidence. Focusing on most consistent findings can allow more comfort in providing unqualified, practical advice.
* Negotiation among stakeholders. Negotiating a fair set of rules across broad choices can help settle continuous issues as they arise.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: 3 Steps to Strategy

* Identify the who, what, and how.
* Identify a bottleneck that is preventing improvement.
* Craft a set of rules that, when applied to the bottleneck, lead to improvements.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: 3 Characteristics of Bottlenecks

* Direct and significant impact on value creation.
* Represent recurrent decisions, allowing testing, refinement, and re-use.
* Arise when opportunities exceed available resources.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: Common Bottlenecks

* The how from a who, what, how analysis often points in the right direction.
* Choosing external partners is often a place where opportunity exceeds capacity.
* Decisions requiring coordination across departments or teams often lead to bottlenecks.

## Strategy as Simple Rules: Developing Rules

* Involve a team in a structured process to get more diverse inputs.
* Include some of the people who will use the rules on a day-to-day basis.
  * They are closest to the facts and best positioned to codify experience into rules.
  * They will have a clearer understanding of the right balance between guidance and discretion.
  * They will be more likely to buy-in to the final rules, and therefore apply them in practice.
  * They will be better positioned to explain the rules and rationale to colleagues who did not participate in the development process.
* Test your rules early and often, then refine them from what you learn.

## Personal Simple Rules

* Personal value is the gap between what brings you the most happiness and what keeps you  from enjoying life to the fullest.
* Focus on what you most want to improve and what you can change to progress.
* Role models can be a good source of rules, but their rules may be implicit.
* If more than one person will be impacted, it is critical for everyone to focus on the same bottleneck.

## Questions for Extracting Implicit Rules
  * Explain your situation and ask what they would do differently.
  * Tease out extremes by asking what they always do or never do.
  * Ask them to walk through recent examples.

## How Rules Improve

* Shift from superficial and convenient rules to strategic and abstract ones that apply over a broader range of activities and decisions. Driven by retrospectives with groups at multiple levels.
* Rules clarify in order of difficulty to learn/discern: Boundary and how-to; prioritizing, timing and coordination; and stopping last.
* Rules go through simplification cycles in which their number grows, then shrinks, and finally becomes constant.

## Breaking Rules

* If new rules are needed, the right choice is often moving to them as quickly as possible.
* Most of us overattribute our success to ourselves rather than circumstance, and conversely underattribute our failures to ourselves.
* Research indicates we learn best when we make accurate attributions.
* Attribution is more likely to be correct when experiences are routinely discussed.

## Conclusion

* Simple rules take a lot of effort to develop.
* Some people benefit from complexity. The costs of complex systems are often distributed, while the benefits are concentrated.
* We fall victim to the "myth of requisite complexity", a mistake belief that complex problems demand complicated solutions.
* Complex rules and regulations often arise out of a distrust of human nature: if people cannot be trusted, detailed regulations prevent malfeasance.

# Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World by Donald Sull and Kathleen M. Eisenhardt
- Whether they are used by rock stars or crickets, effective simple rules share four common traits. First, they are limited to a handful. Capping the number of rules makes them easy to remember and maintains a focus on what matters most. Second, simple rules are tailored to the person or organization using them. College athletes and middle-aged dieters may both rely on simple rules to decide what to eat, but their rules will be very different. Third, simple rules apply to a well-defined activity or decision, such as prioritizing injured soldiers for medical care. Rules that cover multiple activities or choices end up as vague platitudes, such as “Do your best” and “Focus on customers.” Finally, simple rules provide clear guidance while conferring the latitude to exercise discretion. (7)
- Simple rules, as we use the term, refers to a handful of guidelines tailored to the user and task at hand, which balance concrete guidance with the freedom to exercise judgment. (7)
- Simple problems address a few variables that can be reduced to a deterministic formula. (9)
- Applying complicated solutions to complex problems is an understandable approach, but flawed. The parts of a complex system can interact with one another in many different ways, which quickly overwhelms our ability to envision all possible outcomes. (13)
- Complicated solutions can overwhelm people, thereby increasing the odds that they will stop following the rules. (13)
- Michael Pollan distilled his nutritional insights into three simple rules: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” (21)
- Simple rules work best when flexibility matters more than consistency. (30)
- Detailed rules enhance efficiency in executing routine activities. (31)
- Simple rules work because they focus on key aspects of a decision while ignoring peripheral considerations. (32)
- Simple rules not only trigger people to act, they also keep them from abandoning a decision once they have made it. (36)
- Complicated models also work particularly well when data is ample and the underlying causal relationships among variables are well understood. (37)
- When many parties must work together, simple trumps complex. (44)
- Simple rules work because they do three things well. First, they allow for flexibility in the pursuit of new opportunities, avoiding the rigidity of too many rules and the chaos of none at all. They are particularly effective when the situation is in flux, flexibility trumps consistency, and the benefits of seizing opportunities exceed the cost of making mistakes. Second, simple rules can produce decisions that match or outperform more sophisticated decision models across a wide variety of possible scenarios, and do so quickly, with limited data requirements, and when cause and effect are imperfectly understood. Their simplicity, in addition, increases the odds that people will remember them, act on them, and stick with them over time. Finally, collective action, like the honeybees’ choice of nest, can emerge from simple rules even when individuals’ mental capacity is limited and no one member understands the situation in its entirety. By following a few simple rules, members of a community can produce results, like the choice of a safe nest or the protection of intellectual property, far better than what individuals could do on their own. (44)
- Stopping rules dictate when to reverse a decision. They provide guidance, for example, on when to sell a stock, end the search for a mate, or descend from a treacherous mountaintop. (49)
- Considering the jaw-gaping complexity of DARPA’s initiatives, it is perhaps surprising that the organization uses two simple boundary rules to decide which projects to fund. First, the project must further the quest for fundamental scientific understanding, and second, it must have a practical use. (52)
- Boundary rules can translate statistical findings into easy-to-use decision aids. (55)
- Boundary rules can also translate broad policies into practical guidelines. (55)
- Boundary rules guide the choice of what to do (and not do) without requiring a lot of time, analysis, or information. Boundary rules work well for categorical choices, like a judge’s yes-or-no decision on a defendant’s bail, and decisions requiring many potential opportunities to be screened quickly. These rules also come in handy when time, convenience, and cost matter. (56)
- Prioritizing rules can help you rank a group of alternatives competing for scarce money, time, or attention. (57)
- Prioritizing rules are useful when a large number of opportunities meet the threshold of the boundary rules, but resources are limited. (57)
- Nobel Prize–winning economist Herbert A. Simon argued that individuals lack the information, time, and brainpower to determine the single best option when faced with a sequence of alternatives. Instead, like crickets, they rely on a rule of thumb to stop searching when they find an alternative that is good enough. Simon called this rule satisficing, an inelegant but descriptive combination of the words satisfy and suffice. (64)
- Stopping rules can also help people desist from mindless behavior. (66)
- Stopping rules are particularly critical in situations when people tend to double down on a losing hand. (67)
- By constraining infinite possibilities, simple rules allow creativity to flourish, less from thinking outside the box and more from deciding how to draw the box in the first place. (78)
- Balancing novelty and consistency, it turns out, is especially important for individuals and organizations that want to grow. (79)
- How-to rules address the basics of getting things done without prescribing every detail of what to do. They work well in situations where the unexpected is the expected, like Jack’s bar, where every night the crowd and vibe were different, and sportscasting, where no match is ever quite the same. They can stimulate creativity, shape action when there is no time to plan, and create structure that allows entrepreneurs to grow their company. (81)
- While coordination rules work well for groups like improvisational comedians, jazz bands, and basketball teams that are all interacting in plain view, they are also helpful in situations where coordination must take place over space and time. In these situations, no one can see the big picture. Coordination rules can be followed using only local information. (86)
- Simple rules for coordination address how to accomplish activities that require multiple actors, such as people, animals, and nations, to work together. Coordination rules delineate what to do, and likewise what others should do, so that collective objectives like winning battles and flying safely can be achieved. (87)
- Timing rules sometimes specify taking action when some triggering event happens. Known as event pacing, this kind of rule links actions to events, such as getting drowsy in the insomniacs’ rule of going to bed when tired. Other timing rules call for action at a particular time on the clock or calendar. Known as time pacing, these timing rules create deadlines and rhythms, like the morning drumbeat of the insomniacs’ rule to get up at the same time every day. (89)
- Timing rules are particularly relevant in competitive situations when rivals go out of their way to disrupt their opponents. (92)
- An intriguing timing rule in competitive situations is to stay out of sync. (92)
- The six types of rules—boundary, prioritizing, stopping, how-to, coordination, and timing—are often used in combination. (94)
- The Nobel Prize–winning economist Friedrich Hayek believed the rules that guide human society emerged through an evolutionary process (99)
- Rules evolve to address the most pressing issues in communities. (101)
- While evolved rules benefit from legitimacy and relevance, they also have weaknesses. Evolved rules are often implicit and deeply entrenched, making it difficult to examine them critically when circumstances change, or abandon them when they become dysfunctional. (101)
- Over more than a decade of studying simple rules and working with individuals and organizations to develop them, we have identified four approaches that people commonly use to formulate rules. People can develop their rules through thoughtful engagement with their own experience, a particularly effective approach for those with lots of relevant history. People can also develop their rules by adopting the experiences of others, as conveyed through firsthand advice, books, and analogies. This approach works especially well when there is a close match between the borrowed experience and the situation at hand. When high-quality scientific evidence exists, distilling it into simple rules can be the best approach. Finally, simple rules can arise through negotiation, when diverse stakeholders have divergent aims and views of what to do. (102)
- Analogies can be a powerful source of rules even when the comparison involves two very different domains. (107)
- Learning from another’s experience can be helpful in crafting our own simple rules when the essential features of that experience correlate with our own. But it’s possible to be misled by superficial features when deciding whether an analogy works. (109)
- By focusing on the most consistent findings, scientists can be more comfortable advocating them, without qualification, as practical advice. (113)
- James Buchanan, a Nobel Prize–winning economist, argued that when there are competing interests, it is critical for stakeholders to negotiate decision rules (like the Executive Education ones) before haggling over specific decisions (115)
- An agreed set of rules provides a clear framework for settling contentious issues. When negotiating rules to guide future decisions, stakeholders cannot anticipate every situation or what their interests might be in every case. Since they cannot forecast every contingency, they are more likely to converge on general rules that a wide range of stakeholders can live with and consider fair across a broad set of choices. (115)
- Negotiation can be a helpful approach even if there is a higher authority, when multiple interest groups are involved, their values conflict, and some facts are hard to come by. (115)
- The first step is to identify the critical choices that will drive a wedge between revenues and costs to increase profits and sustain them over time. The second step is to identify a bottleneck, a decision or activity that is preventing the company from improving profitability. The final step is to craft a set of simple rules that, when applied to the bottleneck, improves profitability. (123)
- Clarity on what will move the needles is a necessary prelude to developing a strategy of simple rules. Crystallizing your who, what, and how defines which game you are going to play. (130)
- The best bottlenecks to focus on share three characteristics. First, they have a direct and significant impact on value creation. (131)
- Second, chosen bottlenecks should represent recurrent decisions (rather than one-off choices), so the rules can be tested, refined, and used many times. (131)
- Finally, bottlenecks, as their name implies, arise when opportunities exceed available resources. (131)
- The choice of bottleneck may seem obvious after the fact, but selecting one activity among many is a daunting task for most managers. The how from a who, what, how analysis is a good place to start, and often points in the right direction. (132)
- Choosing external partners is another bottleneck where opportunities often exceed a firm’s capacity to pursue them. (134)
- Decisions that require coordination across different departments or teams are another good place to look for bottlenecks. (135)
- Simple rules can provide a framework that helps managers from different departments make decisions, even difficult ones, more quickly and effectively. (135)
- Developing rules from the top down is a big mistake. When leaders rely on their gut instincts, they overemphasize recent events, build in their personal biases, and ignore data that doesn’t fit with their preconceived notions. It is much better to involve a team, typically ranging in size from four to eight members, and use a structured process to harness members’ diverse insights and points of view. When drafting the dream team to develop simple rules, it is critical to include some of the people who will be using them on a day-to-day basis. (138)
- Having users make the rules confers several advantages. First, they are closest to the facts on the ground and best positioned to codify experience into usable rules. Because they will make decisions based on the rules, they can strike the right balance between guidance and discretion, avoiding rules that are overly vague or restrictive. Users can also phrase the rules in language that resonates for them, rather than relying on business jargon. By actively participating in the process, users are more likely to buy into the final rules and therefore apply them in practice. Firsthand knowledge also makes it easier to explain the rules, and their underlying rationale, to colleagues who did not participate in the process. (138)
- It is critical to test your first-cut rules in a rigorous fashion, and refine them in light of your findings. (141)
- Where does strategy live in a company? Too often, a company’s strategy sits on a shelf, gathering dust. A strategy that doesn’t influence critical decisions on a day-to-day basis, however, is not a strategy—it is a book report. Strategy as simple rules provides a vital alternative. Strategy, in our view, lives in the simple rules that guide an organization’s most important activities. They allow employees to make on-the-spot decisions and seize unexpected opportunities without losing sight of the big picture. (143)
- You can raise the top needle by doing more of what makes life worth living, such as spending time with your children, for example, or contributing to your community. Increasing these activities will enhance your sense of well-being, happiness, and self-esteem. You can also create personal value by lowering the bottom needle, which represents problematic areas, such as money worries or poor health, that prevent you from getting the most out of life. Mitigating these negative aspects of life can reduce stress, anxiety, or fear. Personal value consists of the gap between those activities that bring you the most happiness and those that keep you from enjoying life to the fullest. (147)
- The questions below can help you decide where to start: What aspect of your life do you most want to improve? What are the first three things that come to mind? What activities bring you the greatest happiness and sense of well-being? How could you spend more time on these? Which aspects of your life cause you the most fear, stress, or anxiety? How could you decrease these? If you look back in five years, what will you regret not changing? What will you regret if you look back from your deathbed? How might a trusted friend, spouse, or loved one answer these questions for you? (It would be useful to ask them.) (147)
- Activities and decisions that you repeat on a daily or weekly basis also yield data to measure how well your rules are working and refine them based on what you learn. (149)
- Some key questions to consider when selecting a bottleneck include: Do you frequently make this decision or participate in this activity? Does the number of options exceed your available time, money, energy, or attention? Does this activity or decision require willpower? Does this activity or decision require some flexibility? Can you measure results to test and refine your rules? (149)
- Role models are another excellent source of rules. (152)
- When talking with your role models, it’s important to recognize that their simple rules will most likely be implicit, so asking for a list of rules may not be the best approach. A few tactics can help surface tacit rules. First, you can explain how you manage your identified bottleneck, and ask them what they do differently. It’s also productive to tease out extremes, by asking if there are things that they always do or never do when managing the target activity. Another way to explore your role model’s tacit rules is to ask them to walk you through a few recent decisions—what they did and why. People typically find it easier to describe their rules in the context of concrete examples rather than in abstract terms. (152)
- These same tips work well when drawing on your own experience to codify rules. (152)
- In general, it is better to get more comprehensive data for a shorter time period than relying on your imperfect recall of events for a longer period. (153)
- When it comes to gathering and reviewing data to craft simple rules, you typically want to take a few days to a week. (153)
- Once you have some data to work from, you can divide the past examples into three categories—those that worked well in terms of moving the needles, those that worked poorly, and everything in between. (153)
- Negotiation is a particularly productive approach when more than one person needs to follow the rules in order for them to work. (153)
- When more than one person is involved in formulating the rules it is critical for everyone to focus on the same bottleneck. If a family tries to develop rules to cover chores, use of the car, curfew, screen time, dinner, and pet care all at the same time, they will gravitate to broad platitudes—like “Work at being part of our family” or “Treat each other with respect”—that provide little concrete guidance for any specific activity. (154)
- After crafting your preliminary rules, it is helpful to measure how well they are working. Measuring impact allows you to pinpoint what is and isn’t working, and evidence of success also provides more motivation to stick with the rules. (155)
- To measure the impact of your simple rules, it helps to collect some data before you start using your rules. (155)
- Although the systematic process laid out in the last two chapters can be a big help, initial rules are often automatic, obvious, and generally weak. Over time, three things happen. First, their content shifts from superficial and convenient rules to strategic and abstract ones that prove more effective over a broader range of activities and decisions. Second, the different types of rules are learned in a specific sequential order. Boundary and how-to rules usually come first, while the other rule types follow and are harder to learn. Third, the rules go through simplification cycling in which their number grows, and then shrinks and becomes constant. Over time, the rules may continue to shift as circumstances change, but the best rule users keep the number small. (179)
- people usually begin with poor rules or even no conscious rules at all. They lack the information and time to develop quality rules at the outset, so they engage in what Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman termed fast thinking—rather than expending conscious cognitive effort, they adopt innate universal heuristics that are cognitively easy, like representativeness (“Pick what is usual”) and availability (“Pick what first comes to mind”). (181)
- When the entrepreneurial teams had regular meetings to discuss how their companies were performing, they were able to make their rules more strategic (accurate and closely related to success) and abstract (applicable across multiple situations). (182)
- people adopt their simple rules in a specific order, indicating that some types of rules are harder to learn than others. People begin with boundary and how-to rules. Next, they figure out prioritizing, timing, and coordination rules, and learn stopping rules last. (183)
- teams that improved their rules did so by consciously reflecting on their experiences routinely within groups from multiple levels of their companies. (187)
- In other words, the best strategy for improving was doing something else when that something else was related experience. (193)
- The right choice is often to move to the new rules as quickly as possible. Performance will typically decline in the short run, but the transition to the new reality will be faster and more complete in the long run. In contrast, changing slowly often results in an awkward combination of the past and the future with neither fitting the other or working well. (204)
- Most of us tend to overattribute our successes to ourselves rather than to the circumstances, and conversely underattribute our failures to ourselves. (211)
- Research indicates that people learn best from their experience when they make accurate attributions, especially from failures. (212)
- People are more likely to develop correct attributions when they routinely discuss their experiences, (212)
- Why aren’t simple rules even more common? (224)
- The first obstacle is the effort required to develop simple rules. (224)
- The people who benefit from complexity pose a second obstacle to simplicity. The costs of complex solutions are distributed across many people while the benefits of complexity tend to be concentrated in the hands of a few. (225)
- The third obstacle to simplicity is what we call the “myth of requisite complexity,” the mistaken belief that complex problems demand complicated solutions. (225)
- Often, complex rules and regulations arise out of a distrust of human nature. If people cannot be trusted to do the right thing, detailed regulations are necessary to prevent malfeasance. (227)
