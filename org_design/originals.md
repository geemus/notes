# Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World

* Successful originals begin by questioning defaults and then balance risk portfolios.
* Instead of accepting defaults, take initiative to seek out better options. When you encounter something you don't like, fix it. Having taken initiative to improve things, you have little reason to go elsewhere, as you have created the job you want.
* People are motivated to rationalize the status quo, even if it is against their interests. "People who suffer the most from a given state of affairs are paradoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or change it." (Jost and colleagues)
* Start with curiosity. Why does the default exist? Recognizing that most have social origins (they were created by people) gives us the courage to contemplate how they can be changed.
* Creative kids are least likely to become teacher's pets.
* Valueing achievement highly can crowd out originality, as you come to dread failure.
* Advocating for new systems often requires demolishing old ways, and we may hold back for fear of rocking the boat.
* Originality doesn't require extreme risk taking, originals are far more ordinary than we realize. Manage a risk portfolio. When embracing danger in one domain, offset overall risk by exercising caution in another. Having more security in one realm gives us freedom in another.
* Googlers who were randomly assigned to think of their jobs as malleable were happier and more performant. Having considered how their jobs could be modified, they took actions to improve them. By deviating from defaults they also qualified themselves for roles that were a better fit. Many realized their limits were of their own making.
* Originals aren't different than the rest of us. They have the same fears and doubts. What sets them apart is that they take action anyway, knowing that they would regret failing less than they would regret not trying.

## Recognizing Original Ideas

* Overconfidence may be particularly difficult to overcome in creative domains. New ideas are by definition unique, so previous feedback may not apply.
* To maximize the odds of creating something truly great, create a large number of ideas. More prolific people are more original and have the most original output during their most prolific periods.
* The best way to get better at judging ideas is to gather feedback.
  * Fellow creators (colleagues) tend to be the best evaluators and givers of feedback.
  * Managers tend to be too risk averse, focusing on costs of bad ideas rather than benefits of good ones, leading to many false negatives.
  * Focus groups tend to be set up in a way that makes the same mistakes as managers (Justin Berg research).
* Those with moderate expertise in a particular domain are most open to radically creative ideas.
* The more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world (Erik Dane research).
* Spending just six minutes developing original ideas made people more open to novelty.
* We can gain breadth by widening our cultural repertoire.
* Our intuitions are only accurate in domains where we have a lot of experience (Erik Dane research). Non-experts make sounder judgements through thorough analysis.
* The more successful people have been in the past, the worse they perform when entering a new environment. Overconfidence makes it less likely that critical feedback will be sought, even though the context is radically different.
* When assessing the prospects of a novel idea, it's all too easy to be seduced by the enthusiasm of the people behind it.
* If we want to improve idea selection, we shouldn't look at whether people have been successful. We should look at how they've been successful.
* Instead of limiting idea generation/selection to managers, Warby Parker makes this process completely transparent in a shared document. Everyone in the company can read, comment, and discuss in a biweekly meeting.

## Speaking Truth to Power

* Leaders and managers appreciate iniative when offering to help, building networks, gathering knowledge, and seeking feedback. But speaking up with suggestions can get penalized.
* Our sense of commitment and control at work depends more on our direct boss than anyone else.
* Need to tease apart two dimensions of social heriarchy: power (exercising control and authority over others) and status (being respected and admired).
* By gaining respect we can also gain idiosyncracy credits - latitude to deviate from expectations. These accrue through respect, not rank, and are based on contributions. (Edwin Hollander)
* When pitching a novel idea or speaking up with a suggestion for a change, your audience is likely to be skeptical. There are at least four reasons to adopt Griscom's strategy of accentuating the flaws of your idea:
  * Leading with weaknesses disarms the audience. When we feel that someone is trying to persuade us, we raise our mental shields. (Marian Friestad and Peter Wright)
  * It makes you look smart, in that you have done your homework and anticipated problems that would be spotted. People think amateurs can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.
  * Being up front about downsides makes you appear more trustworthy.
  * It leaves the audience with a more favorable assessment of the idea, due to a bias in how we process information. Namely, the easier it is to think of something, the more common and important we assume it is (we use ease of retrieval as a signal). By acknowledging serious problems, it makes it harder to think of new problems/critiques. (Norbert Schwarz)
* If we want people to accept original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat. Change agents typically undercommunicated their visions by a factor of ten. (John Kotter)
* The mere exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it. Again this may relate to ease of processing. Liking appears to increase as people are exposed to an idea between ten and twenty times, with additional exposure still useful with more complex ideas. Exposures are more effective when short and mixed with other ideas to maintain curiosity. It's also best to introduce delay between presentation and evaluation to let things sink in. (Robert Zajonc)
* It's impossible for us to imagine what it's like to listen for the first time because we are already too familiar with our ideas.
* There are four ways to handle a dissatisfying situation: exit, voice, persistence, and neglect. Only voice and exit can improve your situation. (Albert Hirshman)
* Only when you believe your actions matter and care deeply will you consider speaking up. When we decide to speak up, choosing our audience matters as much as how we deliver the message.
* As much as agreeable people may love us, they often hate conflict even more. The desire to please others and preserve harmony makes them prone to backing down instead of sticking up for us.
* When managers have a track record of challenging the status quo, they tend to be more open to new ideas and less threatened by contributions of others.
* It may be more effective to voice ideas upward and downward, and spend less time attempting to make suggestions to middle managers. Relates to sociologist George Homon note that middle-status conservatism reflects the anxiety experienced by one who aspires to a social station but fears disenfranchisement.
* Extensive research shows that when women speak up on behalf of others, they avoid backlash, because they're being communal.

## Timing, Strategic Procrastination, and the First-Mover Disadvantage

* Putting off a task buys time for divergent thinking, rather than foreclosing on a particular idea. (via Shin)
* People have better memory for incomplete than complete tasks. Once finished we stop thinking about it, but when interrupted and left undone, it stays active in our mind. (via Bluma Zeigarnik)
* Procrastinating also keeps us open to improvisation. When we plan in advance, we often stick to the structure we've created, closing the door to creative possibilities that might spring into view.
* Great originals are great procrastinators, but they don't skip planning altogether. They procrastinate strategically, making gradual progress by testing and refining different possibilities.
* Being original doesn't require being first, just being different and better. First-mover advantage only tends to prevail when patented technology is involved, or when there are strong network effects. (via Lisa Bolton)
  * First, when rushing to be pioneers, originals are prone to overstep. When a market is more defined, settlers can focus on superior quality instead of deliberating what to offer in the first place.
  * Second, late movers may be better suited to succeed as they balance their risk portfolios and wait for the right opportunity before entering.
  * Third, along with being less recklessly ambitious, settlers can improve upon competitors' tech to make products better.
  * Fourth, pioneers tend to get stuck in their early offerings, settlers can observe market changes and shifting consumer tastes and adjust.
* As Max Planck observed, "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die."
* When a market is uncertain, unknown, or underdeveloped, being a pioneer has pronounced disadvantages.
* Just as procrastinating can give task flexibility, delaying market entry can open us to learning and adaptability, and reduce risks associated with originality.
* Two styles of innovation: (Galenson)
  * Conceptual innovators are sprinters, formulating big ideas and setting out to execute them.
  * Experimental innovaters are marathoners, solving problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go.
* To sustain originality as we age and accumulate expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach. We can make fewer plans in advance and test out tentative ideas and solutions. With enough patience we may stumble upon something novel and useful.

## Creating and Maintaining Coalitions

* Even though they share objectives, radical groups often disparage more mainstream groups as imposters and sellouts, a concept known as horizontal hostility. (via Judith White)
* Rather than focusing on groups with shared values, we may find stronger affininity with those that share the same tactices and methods of engagement.
* Conflicts between two groups are often caused and intensified by conflicts within the group (via Herbert Kelman). To build coalitions you need doves in each group to sit down, listen to each other's perspectives, identify common goals/methods, and engage in join problem solving.
* Simon Sinek argues if we want to inspire, we should start with why. If we communicate the vision behind our ideas, and purpose guiding our products, people will flock to us. When you are communicating something that challenges the status quo, though, you have to be careful about how you communicate your why.
* To succeed, originals often must become tempered radicals (Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully). Shifting from why to how can help people become less radical.
* By opening with moderate asks instead of radical ones, what Robert Cialdini calls the foot-in-the-door technique, you can gain allies.
* Movements need to draw in more casual participants if they are to succeed. Coalitions often fall apart when people refuse to moderate their radicalism.
* Insiders and outsiders have distinct ideas about who represents a coalition (Blake Ashforth and Peter Reingen). For insiders, the key representitive is most central and connected. For outsiders, the key representative has the most extreme views.
* Enemies make better allies than frenemies. We need to tease apart how positive and how negative a relationship is. Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative relationships (Bert Uchino). Intuition suggests we should sever bad relationships and salvage ambivalent ones, but evidence suggests the opposite: cut out frenemies and attempt to convert enemies.
* If we convert enemies, avoiding cognitive dissonance will motivate them to maint a positive relationship.
* Our former adversaries are often the most effective a persuading others to join. They can marshall better arguments because they understand the doubts and misgivings, making them a more credible source.
* Experiments suggest that we're often more sensitive to gains and losses in esteem than the level of esteem itself (Elliot Aronson).
* Our starting point in generating ideas shapes the path, constraining what we imagine.
* To come up with something original, we need to begin from a more unfamiliar place. But more novel starting points don't necessarily make them palatable and practical to our audiences. The most promising ideas begin with novelty then add familiarity, capitalizing on the mere exposure effect.

## How Siblings, Parents, and Mentors Nurture Originality

* When using the logic of consequences, we can always find reasons not to take risks. The logic of appropriateness frees us up. We think less about outcomes and more about what someone like us ought to do. This tendency can be influenced by birth order, with firstborns tending toward more risk aversion and defending the status quo, while laterborns are inclined to challenge the status quo.
* Niche picking may help explain why laterborn may actively seek to be different.
* Firstborns grow up in a world of adults, whereas with more siblings you spend learning from other children. When older siblings serve as surrogate parents and role models, you don't face as many rules or punishments, while still enjoying the security of their protection. You also end up taking risks earlier by following the lead of other children, instead of the carefully considered choices of adults.
* Parenting behaviors can nurture rebellion at any position in birth order, even if they are more common with younger children.
* Parents of highly creative children had an average of less than one rule and tended to emphasize moral values, rather than specific rules (Teresa Amabile).
* When many rules are enforced, but with clear rationale for their importance, teenagers are substantially less likely to break them, because they internalize them.
* When our character is praised, we internalize it as part of our identities. Instead of engaging in isolated moral acts, we start to develop a unified self-concept as a moral person.
* Affirming character appears to have the strongest effect in the critical periods when children are beginning to formulate strong identities. In one study, for example, praising character boosted moral actions of 8-year-olds, but not 5-year-olds or 10-year-olds.
* In another study children 3-6 were 22-29% more likely to clean up when asked to be helpers instead of to help. These appeals to character are effective for adults as well, suggesting we should embrace nouns thoughtfully, ie "Don't Be a Drunk Driver" instead of "Don't Drink and Drive." (via Christopher Bryan)
* When we shift emphasis from behavior to character, people evaluate choices differently. Instead of asking whether a behavior will achieve particular results they want, they will take action because it is the right thing to do.
* We can give children more freedom if we explain consequences of their actions on others and emphasize how right moral choices demonstrate good character. Highlighting consequences for others directs attention to the distress of those who may be harmed, fueling empathy. It also helps children understand the role their own actions play in causing harm, resulting in guilt. The dual moral emotions of empathy and guilt activate the desire to right wrongs of the past and behave better in the future. Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. (the Oliners)
* The paradox of encouraging children to develop strong values is that parents effectively limit their own influence; leading both to more rule following and more rebelliousness. By explaining moral principles, parents encourage voluntary compliance with rules that align and questioning of rules that don't. Good explanations enable the development of a code of ethics which coincides with social expectations; when they don't square up, children can rely on the internal compass of values rather than the external compass of rules.
* As children grow up, they often don't aim high enough. Having a role model can elevate their aspirations. If we want to encourage originality, we can raise our children's aspirations by introducing them to different kinds of role models. Finding mentors is not always easy, but we can also use stories of great originals throughout history or even fictional characters.
* Studies show that when children's stories emphasize original achievements, the next generation innovates more.
* By encountering images of originality in history and fiction, the logic of consequence fades. We no longer worry as much about what will happen if we fail.
* Regardless of birth order, having compelling role models for originality expands our awareness of niches that we had never considered.

## The Myths of Strong Cultures, Cults, and Devil's Advocates

* Groupthink - the tendency to seek consensus instead of fostering dissent. The enemy of originality; people feel pressured to conform to the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought.
* Evidence suggests that social bonds don't drive groupthink; overconfidence and reputational concerns do.
* The professional blueprint emphasizes hiring based on skills, the star blueprint emphasizes hiring based on future potential, and the commitment blueprint focuses on hiring based on those matching company values and norms. Professional/Star gave employees autonomy and challenging tasks, whereas commitment worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees and to the organization. Skills and stars are fleeting; commitment lasts. Althought fruitful at first, commitment tends to falter over time.
* Organizations tend to become more homogeneous over time as they attract, select, socialize, and retain similar people, effectively weeding out diversity in thoughts and values. (via Benjamin Schneider)
* As markets become more dynamic, big companies with strong cultures struggle to recognize the need for change and are more likely to resist insights from those who think differently. As a result, they don't learn and adapt, and don't have better or more reliable financial results than their competitors.
* Minority viewpoints are important, not because they tend to prevail but because they stimulate divergent attention and thought. As a result, even when they are wrong they contribute to the detection of novel solutions and decisions that, on balance, are qualitatively better. (via Charlan Nemeth)
* Bridgewater promotes expressing original ideas. Employees are expected to voice concerns and critiques directly to each other. They are evaluated on whether they speak up, and can be fired for failing to challenge the status quo.
* If you want a strung culture, it's paramount to make diversity one of your core values.
* In hiring, instead of similarity to gauge cultural fit, Bridgewater assesses cultural contribution.
* The goal is an idea meritocracy, where the best ideas win. To get the best ideas on the table in the first place, you need radical transparency.
* Devil's advocate is often ineffective due to confirmation bias. To overcome a majority preference, groups need to consider more articles against than in support of. (via Charlan Nemeth)
* It's better to unearth a devil's advocate than assign one. When designated they often do not argue forcefully or consistently enough, and may not be taken seriously. The secret is sincerity, which is hard to fake. They need to believe what they are representing, and the group needs to believe that they believe. Even devil's advocates who did believe were doubted if others knew they were assigned the role. Whereas people doubt assigned dissenters, genuine dissenters challenge people to doubt themselves. Compared to assigned dissenters, authentic dissenters don't make group members substantially angered and they're actually liked slightly more.
* The norm is to have "strong opinions, weakly held" as per futurist Paul Saffo.
* If employees are in sync about making sure that everyone speaks up, they don't need to worry as much about groupthink.
* Cultures that focus too heavily on solutions become cultures of advocacy, dampening inquiry. If you are expected to have an answer ready, you'll arrive with diagnosis complete, missing out on the chance to incorporate other perspectives. When members have different information, inquiry needs to preced advocacy. You need to raise problems before pursuing solutions. (via Hofmann)
* To ensure authentic dissent, Bock created the "Canaries", a group of trusted engineers with diverse viewpoints with a reputation for both being sensitive to adverse conditions and for speaking their minds. They are part advisory board, part focus group, and have become an invaluable safeguard to make sure Googlers' voices are heard.
* Getting problems noted is half the battle, the other is listening to the right opinions about how to solve them. Bridgewater does this by gathering credible people to diagnose, share reasoning, and explore causes and possible solutions.
* When groups are instructed to rank order alternatives, instead of choosing the best one, they're more likely to consider each option, share information about unpopular ones, and make a good decision. (Andrea Hollingshead)
* At Bridgewater every employee has a believability score on a range of dimensions. When you are about to interact you can see their track record on seventy-seven different dimenions of values, skills, and abilities in the areas of higher-level thinking, practical thinking, maintaining high standards, determination, open-mindedness yet assertiveness, organization and reliability.
* In presenting your views, you are expected to consider your own believability by telling your audience how confident you are. If you have doubts and you're not known as believable in the domain, you shouldn't have opinions in the first place; you're supposed to ask questions so you can learn. If you are expressing a fierce conviction, you should be forthright--but know your colleaguse will probe the quality of your reasoning. Even then, you're supposed to be assertive and open-minded at the same time.
* Even if your organization doesn't currently embrace critical upward feedback, holding an open season on leaders might be an effective way to begin changing the culture. By role modeling receptivity, employees across the company may become more willing to challenge leaders and one another.
* One can collect anonymous feedback, focus on constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, and email the full verbatim set to those who participated. Then follow up by summarizing what you felt were key suggestions, solicit feedback on interpretation, and propose changes to address the issues.
* Employees can also be encouraged to challenge others (including senior leaders) by being encouraged from early in training to question the principles.
* By the time employees are up to speak, they are already beginning to see the world the way the company does. The early period is a perfect time for employees to pay attention to opportunities to improve the culture. One possibility for this is to hold entry interviews.
* No one has a right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up about it.
* One of the main purposes for values is to help people between conflicting options, so they should be prioritized. (via Shalom Schwartz)
* Bridgewater uses discussion and debate to seek consensus, but they might be better served by randomized, controlled experiments. The quality of evidence there is the gold standard, whereas opinion of respected authorities is the least rigorous evidence.
* "Shapers" are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. They act in the face of risk, because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their feel of failing. The greatest shapers don't stop at introducing originality to the world. They create cultures that onleash originality in others.

## Managing Anxiety, Apathy, Ambivalence, and Anger

* Those who aced emotion regulation tests spoke up more often with ideas and suggestions to challenge the status quo--and their managers rated them as more effective in doing so.
* Two strategies for handling challenges: (Julie Norem)
  * strategic optimism: anticipate the best, stay calm and set high expectations.
  * defensive pessimists: expect the worst, feel anxious and imagine what can go wrong. Although more anxious and less confident, perform just as well as strategic optimists, thanks to a realistic appraisal and exhaustive plan.
* When we are not yet committed, thinking like a defensive pessimist can be hazardous. But once we have chose a course of action, it's better to confront them directly as a defensive pessimist might.
* Negative thoughts can direct our attention to potential problems, and the absense of those thoughts predicts a failure to take preventative and corrective action.
* Rather than trying to suppress a strong emotion, it's easier to convert it to a different, equally intense emotion. ie "I am excited" when we feel anxious. (Brooks)
* Fear is marked by uncertainty and the fear something bad will happen. But because it hasn't occurred, something good could happen too.
* Originality brings more bumps in the road, yet leaves us with more happiness and a greater sense of meaning.
* The most inspiring way to convey a vision may be to outsource it to the people who are actually affected by it. (Dave Hoffmann and Adam Grant) ie have a leader describe a vision and then invite a customer to bring it to life with a personal story. The leader provides an overarching vision which the user bolters with emotional appeal.
* Flying solo with an opinion can make even committed originals fearful enough to conform to the majority. The easiest way to encourage non-conformity is to introduce a single dissenter. Merely knowing you are not alone makes it much easier to reject the crowd.
* Just having one friend is enough to significantly decrease loneliness (Sigal Barsade and Hakan Ozcelik).
* If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they're not alone. ie resistance movements help people overcome fear by providing small actions they can do to signal support of a larger group. It's easier to rebel when it feels like an act of conformity. Other people are involved, so we can join, too.
* Humor is an effective weapon against fear, it's hard to be afraid of speaking up when you're laughing at the target of your rebellion. (Popovic) Effective humor puts oppressors in a lose-lose situation.
* We tend to be risk averse in the domain of benefits, when we have certain gain, we like to hold and protect it. But if presented with a guaranteed loss, we're willing to do whatever it takes to avoid the loss, even if it means risking an even bigger one.
* In trying to modify behavior, is it better to highlight benifits of changing or costs of not changing? If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize the benefits--they'll want to act to gain. But if they believe it is risky, we need to destabilize the status quo and accentuate the bad things that will happen if they don't change. Taking a risk is more appealing when faced with a guaranteed loss if they don't. (Peter Salovey)
* The "kill the company" exercise is powerful because it reframes a gain-fraimed activity in terms of losses. When deliberating innovation opportunities, the leaders weren't inclined to take risks. When considering how they could be put out of business instead, they realized it was a risk not to innovate. The urgency of innovation became apparent.
* If you want people to take risks, you need to show them what's wrong with the present. You have to drive them out of their comfort zones, cultivating dissatisfaction, frustration, or anger at the current state, making it a guaranteed loss.
* The greatest communicators establish the status quo and then compare it to what could be, making that gap as big as possible. (Nancy Duarte)
* The audience was only prepared to be moved by MLKs dream of tommorow after he had exposed the nightmare of today.
* When experiencing doubt on the way toward a goal, our next step depends on our commitment. When commitment is wavering, the best way to stay on track is to look back at the progress already made. Once commitment is fortified, however, it's best to look forward and highlight the work that remains. When determined to reach the objective the gap is what lights a fire under us.
* Instead of courage, foster a level of fury with the status quo such that one cannot not act. (Tom Peters)
* Anger counteracts apathy: We feel that we've been wronged, and we're compelled to fight. But it can also go too far.
* We should seek to be simultaneously hot-headed, fueling action and change, and cool-headed to shape action into legitimate and viable forms. (Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully)
* If you are feeling intense emotions like anxiety or anger, there are two ways to manage it: surface acting, where you put on a mask, modifying speech/gestures/expressions to appear unfazed; or deep acting, where you change your inner feelings also, and not just the outer expression (like method acting). Research shows that deep acting is more sustainable, whereas surface acting burns us out. (Arlie Hochschild)
* Venting doesn't extinguish anger, it feeds it. The better you feel after venting, the more aggresive you get toward your critic, but also bystanders. (Bushman)
* Expressing our thoughts and feelings about stressful or traumatic events is most salutary after we've had some time to process, when we are no longer blinded by anger or consumed by distress. (James Pennebaker)
* One of the major problems with venting is that it focuses attention on the perpetrator of injustice. To channel anger productively, we should instead reflect on the victims who have suffered from it. Focusing on victims of injustice spurs us to speak truth to power (Andrew Brodsky, Joshua Margolis, Joel Brockner). Focusing on the viction activates empathetic anger--the desire to right wrongs done unto others. It activates us while also making us thoughtful about respeting the victim's dignity.
* Research demonstrates that when we are angry at others, we aim for retaliation or revenge. But when we are angry for others, we seek justice and a better system.
* Becoming original is not the easiest path to happiness, but it leaves us poised for the happiness of pursuit.

## Actions for Impact

* Individual Actions:
  * Generating and Recognizing Original Ideas:
    * Question the default.
    * Triple the number of ideas you generate.
    * Immerse yourself in a new domain.
    * Procrastinate strategically.
    * Seek more feedback from peers.
  * Voicing and Championing Original Ideas:
    * Balance your risk portfolio.
    * Highlight the reasons not to support your idea.
    * Make your ideas more familiar.
    * Speak to a different audience - Instead of seeking out friendly people who share your values, try approaching disagreeable ones who share your methods.
    * Be a tempered radical - If your idea is extreme, couch it in a more conventional goal.
  * Managing Emotions:
    * Motivate yourself differently when you're commited by focusing on what remains vs uncertain by focusing on progress so far.
    * Don't try to calm down - It's easier to turn anxiety into intense positive emotions like interest and enthusiasm.
    * Focus on the victim, not the perpetrator.
    * Realize you're not alone.
    * Remember that if you don't take initiative, the status quo will persist. Four responses to dissatisfaction are: exit, voice, persistence, and neglect. Only exit and voice improve your circumstances.
* Leader Actions:
  * Sparking Original Ideas:
    * Run an innovation tournament - instead of a suggestion box, send a call for ideas to solve a particular problem or meet an untapped need.
    * Picture yourself as the enemy - create urgency by implementing the "kill the company" exercise from Lisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink.
    * Invite employees from different functions and levels to pitch ideas.
    * Hold an opposite day - divid into groups and have each choose an assumption, belief, or area of knowledge that is widely taken for granted. Each group asks, "When is the opposite true?" and delivers a presentation.
    * Ban the words like, love, and hate. Instead insist on an explanation of the reasoning behind it.
  * Build Cultures of Originality:
    * Hire not on cultural fit, but on cultural contribution.
    * Shift from exit interviews to entry interviews - instead of waiting to ask for ideas until employees are on their way out, start seeking their insights when they first arrive. Ask what brought them in the door and what would keep them at the firm, and challenge them to think like cultural detectives. They can use their insider-outsider perspective to investigate what belongs in a musueam and what should be kept, as well as potential inconsistencies between espoused and enacted values.
    * Ask for problems, not solutions.
    * Stop assigning devil's advocates and start unearthing them - To identify them, appoint an information manager, someone responsible for seeking out team members individually before meetings to find out what they know.
    * Welcome criticism.
* Parent and Teacher Actions:
  * Ask children what their role models would do.
  * Link good behaviors to moral character - If you see a child do something good, try saying "You're a good person because you ..." Children are also more ethical when asked to be moral, they want to eran the identity.
  * Explain how bad behaviors have consequences for others.
  * Emphasize values over rules.
  * Create novel niches for children to pursue - ie Jigsaw Classroom brings students together for a group project and assigns each a unique part.

# Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg
- Instead of accepting the default, you take a bit of initiative to seek out an option that might be better. And that act of initiative, however tiny, is a window into what you do at work. (271)
- The employees who took the initiative to change their browsers to Firefox or Chrome approached their jobs differently. They looked for novel ways of selling to customers and addressing their concerns. When they encountered a situation they didn’t like, they fixed it. Having taken the initiative to improve their circumstances, they had little reason to leave. They created the jobs they wanted. But they were the exception, not the rule. (275)
- Jost and his colleagues concluded: “People who suffer the most from a given state of affairs are paradoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or change it.” (286)
- Its core idea is that people are motivated to rationalize the status quo as legitimate—even if it goes directly against their interests. (288)
- Justifying the default system serves a soothing function. It’s an emotional painkiller: If the world is supposed to be this way, we don’t need to be dissatisfied with it. But acquiescence also robs us of the moral outrage to stand against injustice and the creative will to consider alternative ways that the world could work. (293)
- The starting point is curiosity: pondering why the default exists in the first place. (298)
- When we become curious about the dissatisfying defaults in our world, we begin to recognize that most of them have social origins: Rules and systems were created by people. And that awareness gives us the courage to contemplate how we can change them. (316)
- Research demonstrates that it is the most creative children who are the least likely to become the teacher’s pet. (337)
- When achievement motivation goes sky-high, it can crowd out originality: The more you value achievement, the more you come to dread failure. (353)
- Advocating for new systems often requires demolishing the old way of doing things, and we hold back for fear of rocking the boat. (392)
- I want to debunk the myth that originality requires extreme risk taking and persuade you that originals are actually far more ordinary than we realize. (441)
- When we embrace danger in one domain, we offset our overall level of risk by exercising caution in another domain. (477)
- Having a sense of security in one realm gives us the freedom to be original in another. (489)
- Managing a balanced risk portfolio doesn’t mean constantly hovering in the middle of the spectrum by taking moderate risks. Instead, successful originals take extreme risks in one arena and offset them with extreme caution in another. (494)
- Then, they looked at their familiar jobs in an unfamiliar way: vuja de. They set out to create a new vision of their roles that was more ideal but still realistic. (568)
- Googlers who were randomly assigned to think about their jobs as malleable showed a spike in happiness and performance. Having considered how their jobs could be modified, they had taken action to improve them. (571)
- By refusing to stick with their default jobs and default skills, they became happier and more effective—and qualified themselves for roles that were a better fit. Many of their limits, they came to realize, were of their own making. (576)
- Having revealed that successful originals often begin by questioning defaults and balancing risk portfolios, the rest of this book is about closing the gap between insight and action. (578)
- Ultimately, the people who choose to champion originality are the ones who propel us forward. After spending years studying them and interacting with them, I am struck that their inner experiences are not any different from our own. They feel the same fear, the same doubt, as the rest of us. What sets them apart is that they take action anyway. They know in their hearts that failing would yield less regret than failing to try. (612)
- Overconfidence may be a particularly difficult bias to overcome in the creative domain. When you’re generating a new idea, by definition it’s unique, so you can ignore all the feedback you’ve received in the past about earlier inventions. Even if your previous ideas have bombed, this one is different. (690)
- If originals aren’t reliable judges of the quality of their ideas, how do they maximize their odds of creating a masterpiece? They come up with a large number of ideas. (714)
- Across fields, Simonton reports that the most prolific people not only have the highest originality; they also generate their most original output during the periods in which they produce the largest volume. (734)
- The best way to get better at judging our ideas is to gather feedback. Put a lot of ideas out there and see which ones are praised and adopted by your target audience. (758)
- Managers tend to be too risk averse: they focus on the costs of investing in bad ideas rather than the benefits of piloting good ones, which leads them to commit a large number of false negatives. (779)
- Rice professor Erik Dane finds that the more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world. (792)
- In practice, though, Justin Berg finds that test audiences are no better than managers at predicting the success of new ideas: focus groups are effectively set up to make the same mistakes as managers. (797)
- But there is one group of forecasters that does come close to attaining mastery: fellow creators evaluating one another’s ideas. (810)
- Instead of attempting to assess our own originality or seeking feedback from managers, we ought to turn more often to our colleagues. (818)
- Just spending six minutes developing original ideas made them more open to novelty, improving their ability to see the potential in something unusual. (836)
- It is when people have moderate expertise in a particular domain that they’re the most open to radically creative ideas. (866)
- Just as scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors often discover novel ideas through broadening their knowledge to include the arts, we can likewise gain breadth by widening our cultural repertoires. (901)
- New research led by Erik Dane shows us why: our intuitions are only accurate in domains where we have a lot of experience. (933)
- Non-experts make sounder judgments when they conduct a thorough analysis. (942)
- The more successful people have been in the past, the worse they perform when they enter a new environment. They become overconfident, and they’re less likely to seek critical feedback even though the context is radically different. (980)
- When assessing the prospects of a novel idea, it’s all too easy to be seduced by the enthusiasm of the people behind it. (997)
- If we want to improve our idea selection skills, we shouldn’t look at whether people have been successful. We need to track how they’ve been successful. (1015)
- Instead of limiting access to the ideas and leaving it up to managers to decide which ones to pursue and implement, Warby Parker made the suggestions completely transparent in a Google document. Everyone in the company could read them, comment on them online, and discuss them in a biweekly meeting. (1057)
- Leaders and managers appreciate it when employees take the initiative to offer help, build networks, gather new knowledge, and seek feedback. But there’s one form of initiative that gets penalized: speaking up with suggestions. (1132)
- we need to tease apart two major dimensions of social hierarchy that are often lumped together: power and status. Power involves exercising control or authority over others; status is being respected and admired. (1137)
- As Medina gained respect for these efforts, she accumulated what psychologist Edwin Hollander called idiosyncrasy credits—the latitude to deviate from the group’s expectations. Idiosyncrasy credits accrue through respect, not rank: they’re based on contributions. (1165)
- when you’re pitching a novel idea or speaking up with a suggestion for change, your audience is likely to be skeptical. (1199)
- Under those circumstances, for at least four reasons, it’s actually more effective to adopt Griscom’s form of powerless communication by accentuating the flaws in your idea. (1200)
- The first advantage is that leading with weaknesses disarms the audience. Marketing professors Marian Friestad and Peter Wright find that when we’re aware that someone is trying to persuade us, we naturally raise our mental shields. (1202)
- People think an amateur can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it. (1237)
- This is the second benefit of leading with the limitations of an idea: it makes you look smart. (1241)
- He was smart enough to do his homework and anticipate some of the problems that they would spot. (1247)
- The third advantage of being up front about the downsides of your ideas is that it makes you more trustworthy. (1248)
- A fourth advantage of this approach is that it leaves audiences with a more favorable assessment of the idea itself, due to a bias in how we process information. (1257)
- Psychologist Norbert Schwarz has shown that the easier it is to think of something, the more common and important we assume it is. We use ease of retrieval as information. (1262)
- This is what happened to investors when Rufus Griscom cited Babble’s weaknesses. By acknowledging its most serious problems, he made it harder for investors to generate their own ideas about what was wrong with the company. (1268)
- By that point, it’s no longer possible to imagine what it sounds like to an audience that’s listening to it for the first time. This explains why we often undercommunicate our ideas. They’re already so familiar to us that we underestimate how much exposure an audience needs to comprehend and buy into them. (1294)
- When Harvard professor John Kotter studied change agents years ago, he found that they typically undercommunicated their visions by a factor of ten. (1296)
- If we want people to accept our original ideas, we need to speak up about them, then rinse and repeat. (1302)
- Eminent psychologist Robert Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect: the more often we encounter something, the more we like it. (1305)
- One explanation for this effect is that exposure increases the ease of processing. An unfamiliar idea requires more effort to understand. The more we see, hear, and touch it, the more comfortable we become with it, and the less threatening it is. (1317)
- Overall, the evidence suggests that liking continues to increase as people are exposed to an idea between ten and twenty times, with additional exposure still useful for more complex ideas. Interestingly, exposures are more effective when they’re short and mixed in with other ideas, to help maintain the audience’s curiosity. It’s also best to introduce a delay between the presentation of the idea and the evaluation of it, which provides time for it to sink in. (1321)
- Building on a classic book by economist Albert Hirschman, there are four different options for handling a dissatisfying situation. Whether you’re unhappy with your job, your marriage, or your government, decades of research show that you have a choice between exit, voice, persistence, and neglect. (1336)
- Only when you believe your actions matter and care deeply will you consider speaking up. (1347)
- At work, our sense of commitment and control depends more on our direct boss than on anyone else. (1352)
- As much as agreeable people may love us, they often hate conflict even more. Their desire to please others and preserve harmony makes them prone to backing down instead of sticking up for us. (1358)
- In the decision to speak up, whom we choose as our audience matters as much as how we deliver our message. (1367)
- Research shows that when managers have a track record of challenging the status quo, they tend to be more open to new ideas and less threatened by contributions from others. (1374)
- As sociologist George Homans observed, “Middle-status conservatism reflects the anxiety experienced by one who aspires to a social station but fears disenfranchisement.” (1386)
- As Carmen Medina moved up the ranks, she learned that it was more effective to voice ideas upward and downward, and spent less time attempting to make suggestions to middle managers. (1400)
- Extensive research shows that when women speak up on behalf of others, they avoid backlash, because they’re being communal. (1424)
- Shin proposed that when you put off a task, you buy yourself time to engage in divergent thinking rather than foreclosing on one particular idea. (1541)
- In 1927, Russian psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik demonstrated that people have a better memory for incomplete than complete tasks. Once a task is finished, we stop thinking about it. But when it is interrupted and left undone, it stays active in our minds. (1606)
- Along with providing time to generate novel ideas, procrastination has another benefit: it keeps us open to improvisation. When we plan well in advance, we often stick to the structure we’ve created, closing the door to creative possibilities that might spring into our fields of vision. (1624)
- Great originals are great procrastinators, but they don’t skip planning altogether. They procrastinate strategically, making gradual progress by testing and refining different possibilities. (1648)
- As marketing researcher Lisa Bolton summarizes, “Although first movers face some advantages in particular industries, the academic research remains mixed and does not support an overall first-mover advantage.” (1675)
- Being original doesn’t require being first. It just means being different and better. (1687)
- When originals rush to be pioneers, they’re prone to overstep; that’s the first disadvantage. (1687)
- Since the market is more defined when settlers enter, they can focus on providing superior quality instead of deliberating about what to offer in the first place. (1698)
- Second, there’s reason to believe that the kinds of people who choose to be late movers may be better suited to succeed. (1703)
- more risk-averse entrepreneurs watch from the sidelines, waiting for the right opportunity and balancing their risk portfolios before entering. (1704)
- Third, along with being less recklessly ambitious, settlers can improve upon competitors’ technology to make products better. (1708)
- Fourth, whereas pioneers tend to get stuck in their early offerings, settlers can observe market changes and shifting consumer tastes and adjust accordingly. (1711)
- As physicist Max Planck once observed, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die.” (1728)
- First-mover advantages tend to prevail when patented technology is involved, or when there are strong network effects (1731)
- And when the market is uncertain, unknown, or underdeveloped, being a pioneer has pronounced disadvantages. (1733)
- Just as procrastinating can give us flexibility on a task, delaying market entry can open us up to learning and adaptability, reducing the risks associated with originality. (1735)
- When Galenson studied creators, he discovered two radically different styles of innovation: conceptual and experimental. Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it. Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go along. (1756)
- According to Galenson, conceptual innovators are sprinters, and experimental innovators are marathoners. (1761)
- These fundamental differences between conceptual and experimental innovators explain why some originals peak early and others bloom late. (1766)
- To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach. We can make fewer plans in advance for what we want to create, and start testing out different kinds of tentative ideas and solutions. Eventually, if we’re patient enough, we may stumble onto something that’s novel and useful. (1799)
- According to Dartmouth psychologist Judith White, a lens for understanding these fractures is the concept of horizontal hostility. Even though they share a fundamental objective, radical groups often disparage more mainstream groups as impostors and sellouts. (1873)
- In seeking alliances with groups that share our values, we overlook the importance of sharing our strategic tactics. (1922)
- Even if they care about different causes, groups find affinity when they use the same methods of engagement. (1927)
- Finally, Perry made a move that flew in the face of every piece of wisdom she had heard about influence; she simply stopped telling experts what it was she was trying to create. Instead of explaining her plan to generate wireless power, she merely provided the specifications of the technology she wanted. (1963)
- In a popular TED talk and book, Simon Sinek argues that if we want to inspire people, we should start with why. If we communicate the vision behind our ideas, the purpose guiding our products, people will flock to us. This is excellent advice—and when you’re doing something original that challenges the status quo, you have to be careful about how you communicate your why. (1972)
- Researchers Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully have found that to succeed, originals must often become tempered radicals. (1976)
- Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. (1981)
- Steinman leveraged what psychologist Robert Cialdini calls the foot-in-the-door technique, where you lead with a small request to secure an initial commitment before revealing the larger one. By opening with a moderate ask instead of a radical one, Steinman gained allies. (1993)
- Coalitions often fall apart when people refuse to moderate their radicalism. (1995)
- Movements, which are always fighting uphill battles, need to draw in more casual participants if they are to succeed.” (2003)
- Her error is illuminated in a new study by management researchers Blake Ashforth and Peter Reingen, who find that insiders and outsiders have distinct ideas about who represents a coalition. (2029)
- For insiders, the key representative is the person who is most central and connected in the group. (2030)
- But for outsiders, the person who represents the group is the one with the most extreme views. (2031)
- Enemies Make Better Allies Than Frenemies (2035)
- Typically, we view our relationships on a continuum from positive to negative. Our closest friends have our backs; our greatest enemies are actively working against us. But research shows that we need to draw two independent axes: one for how positive a relationship is and a separate one for how negative the relationship is. (2037)
- Being undermined and supported by the same person meant even lower commitment and more work missed. (2060)
- In a series of groundbreaking studies, psychologist Bert Uchino found that ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative relationships. (2065)
- Our instinct is to sever our bad relationships and salvage the ambivalent ones. But the evidence suggests we ought to do the opposite: cut our frenemies and attempt to convert our enemies. (2073)
- Half a century ago, eminent psychologist Elliot Aronson conducted a series of experiments suggesting that we’re often more sensitive to gains and losses in esteem than the level of esteem itself. (2077)
- Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet again, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship. (2085)
- Third, and most important, it is our former adversaries who are the most effective at persuading others to join our movements. They can marshal better arguments on our behalf, because they understand the doubts and misgivings of resisters and fence-sitters. And they’re a more credible source, (2086)
- According to Berg, the starting point in generating ideas is like the first brushstroke that a painter lays down on a canvas: it shapes the path for the rest of the painting, constraining what we imagine. (2136)
- To come up with something original, we need to begin from a more unfamiliar place. (2139)
- Although a novel starting point does help foster the originality of our ideas, it doesn’t necessarily make them palatable and practical to our audiences. (2144)
- The most promising ideas begin from novelty and then add familiarity, which capitalizes on the mere exposure effect we covered earlier. (2149)
- Years ago, when studying the conflict between Israel and Palestine, Harvard psychologist Herbert Kelman observed that conflicts between two groups are often caused and intensified by conflicts within the groups. (2225)
- To build coalitions across conflict lines, Kelman finds that it’s rarely effective to send hawks to negotiate. You need the doves in each group to sit down, listen to each other’s perspectives, identify their common goals and methods, and engage in joint problem solving. (2234)
- When we use the logic of consequence, we can always find reasons not to take risks. The logic of appropriateness frees us up. We think less about what will guarantee the outcome we want, and act more on a visceral sense of what someone like us ought to do. And this tendency can be influenced by birth order. (2373)
- “Firstborns are more risk averse than laterborns,” (2384)
- When I examined the data, birth order was a better predictor of nonconformity and risk taking than I had expected. (2395)
- Firstborns tend to defend the status quo; laterborns are inclined to challenge it. (2401)
- There are two dominant explanations for the laterborn tendency to take risks. One concerns how children themselves handle sibling rivalry; the other, how parents raise younger children differently. Although we can’t control birth order, we can influence how it plays (2402)
- In adulthood, adopted siblings don’t resemble each other at all in tendencies toward non-conformity or risk taking, despite having been raised by the same parents. Niche picking might help to make sense of this mystery. (2409)
- Niche picking helps to solve the mystery of why siblings aren’t terribly similar; laterborn children actively seek to be different. (2448)
- Psychologist Robert Zajonc observed that firstborns grow up in a world of adults, while the more older siblings you have, the more time you spend learning from other children. (2452)
- When older siblings serve as surrogate parents and role models, you don’t face as many rules or punishments, and you enjoy the security of their protection. You also end up taking risks earlier: instead of emulating the measured, carefully considered choices of adults, you follow the lead of other children. (2458)
- these parenting behaviors can nurture rebellion among children at any position in the birth order; they may just be most common with the youngest child. (2486)
- Parents of highly creative children had an average of less than one rule and tended to “place emphasis on moral values, rather than on specific rules,” psychologist Teresa Amabile reports. (2514)
- When mothers enforce many rules but offer a clear rationale for why they’re important, teenagers are substantially less likely to break them, because they internalize them. (2517)
- Reasoning does create a paradox: it leads both to more rule following and more rebelliousness. By explaining moral principles, parents encourage their children to comply voluntarily with rules that align with important values and to question rules that don’t. Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often coincides with societal expectations; when they don’t square up, children rely on the internal compass of values rather than the external compass of rules. (2523)
- There’s a particular kind of explanation that works especially well in enforcing discipline. When the Oliners examined the guidance of the Holocaust rescuers’ parents, they found that they tended to give “explanations of why behaviors are inappropriate, often with reference to their consequences for others.” (2527)
- Highlighting consequences for others directs attention to the distress of the person who may be harmed by an individual’s behavior, fueling empathy for her. It also helps children understand the role that their own actions played in causing the harm, resulting in guilt. As Erma Bombeck put it, “Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving.” The dual moral emotions of empathy and guilt activate the desire to right wrongs of the past and behave better in the future. (2531)
- Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. (2534)
- Children who received character praise were subsequently more generous. Of the children who were complimented for being helpful people, 45 percent gave craft materials to cheer up kids at a hospital two weeks later, compared with only 10 percent of the children who were commended for engaging in helpful behavior. When our character is praised, we internalize it as part of our identities. Instead of seeing ourselves as engaging in isolated moral acts, we start to develop a more unified self-concept as a moral person. (2565)
- Affirming character appears to have the strongest effect in the critical periods when children are beginning to formulate strong identities. (2569)
- In one study, for example, praising character boosted the moral actions of eight-year-olds but not five-year-olds or ten-year-olds. (2570)
- appeal to character can have an influence in the moment. In an ingenious series of experiments led by psychologist Christopher Bryan, children between ages three and six were 22 percent to 29 percent more likely to clean up blocks, toys, and crayons when they were asked to be helpers instead of to help. Even though their character was far from gelled, they wanted to earn the identity. (2574)
- Bryan finds that appeals to character are effective for adults as well. (2576)
- In light of this evidence, Bryan suggests that we should embrace nouns more thoughtfully. “Don’t Drink and Drive” could be rephrased as: “Don’t Be a Drunk Driver.” (2582)
- When we shift our emphasis from behavior to character, people evaluate choices differently. Instead of asking whether this behavior will achieve the results they want, they take action because it is the right thing to do. (2585)
- We can afford to give children a great deal of freedom if we explain the consequences of their actions on others and emphasize how the right moral choices demonstrate good character. (2589)
- But as they grow up, they often don’t aim high enough. (2591)
- Having a role model elevated their aspirations. (2594)
- The paradox of encouraging children to develop strong values is that parents effectively limit their own influence. (2601)
- If we want to encourage originality, the best step we can take is to raise our children’s aspirations by introducing them to different kinds of role models. (2605)
- Finding the right mentor is not always easy. But we can locate role models in a more accessible place: the stories of great originals throughout history. (2616)
- In some cases, fictional characters may be even better role models. (2619)
- Remarkably, there are studies showing that when children’s stories emphasize original achievements, the next generation innovates more. (2628)
- As we encounter these images of originality in history and fiction, the logic of consequence fades away. We no longer worry as much about what will happen if we fail. (2638)
- But wherever we fall in the birth order, when we have compelling role models for originality, they expand our awareness of niches that we had never considered. (2647)
- groupthink—the tendency to seek consensus instead of fostering dissent. Groupthink is the enemy of originality; people feel pressured to conform to the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought. (2675)
- The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills: (2727)
- In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future potential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. (2728)
- Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. Skills and potential were fine, but cultural fit was a must. The top priority was to employ people who matched the company’s values and norms. (2730)
- Whereas founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and challenging tasks, those with commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees and to the organization. (2732)
- Skills and stars are fleeting; commitment lasts. (2744)
- he didn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took on; his focus was rather on whether they would value generating novel ideas and dedicate themselves to the mission. (2750)
- As fruitful as commitment cultures are in the early stages of an organization’s life, over time, they tend to falter. (2759)
- Psychologist Benjamin Schneider finds that organizations tend to become more homogeneous over time. As they attract, select, socialize, and retain similar people, they effectively weed out diversity in thoughts and values. (2766)
- Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too insular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and they’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently. As a result, they don’t learn and adapt, and don’t have better or more reliable financial results than their competitors. (2771)
- “Minority viewpoints are important, not because they tend to prevail but because they stimulate divergent attention and thought,” finds Berkeley psychologist Charlan Nemeth, one of the world’s leading experts on group decisions. “As a result, even when they are wrong they contribute to the detection of novel solutions and decisions that, on balance, are qualitatively better.” (2791)
- The evidence suggests that social bonds don’t drive groupthink; the culprits are overconfidence and reputational concerns. (2804)
- They are trained in an intensive boot camp modeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the principles, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and evaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. (2835)
- Bridgewater’s secret is promoting the expression of original ideas. (2842)
- At Bridgewater, employees are expected to voice concerns and critiques directly to each other. (2862)
- “No one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up about it.” (2863)
- At Bridgewater, they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be fired for failing to challenge the status quo. (2864)
- If you’re going to build a strong culture, it’s paramount to make diversity one of your core values. (2866)
- In hiring, instead of using similarity to gauge cultural fit, Bridgewater assesses cultural contribution.* (2868)
- In a cult, core values are dogma. At Bridgewater, employees are expected to challenge the principles themselves. During training, when employees learn the principles, they’re constantly asked: Do you agree? (2870)
- The goal is to create an idea meritocracy, where the best ideas win. To get the best ideas on the table in the first place, you need radical transparency. (2875)
- When Irving Janis analyzed the disease of groupthink, one of his main cures was to appoint a devil’s advocate. (2879)
- But Charlan Nemeth shows that we’re doing it wrong. (2883)
- Because of confirmation bias, they were persuaded by the arguments that affirmed their preference, and discounted those that didn’t. To overcome a majority preference, groups would need to consider more articles against it than in support of it. (2895)
- While it can be appealing to assign a devil’s advocate, it’s much more powerful to unearth one. (2900)
- When people are designated to dissent, they’re just playing a role. This causes two problems: They don’t argue forcefully or consistently enough for the minority viewpoint, and group members are less likely to take them seriously. (2901)
- The secret to success is sincerity, the old saying goes: Once you can fake that, you’ve got it made. In fact, it’s not easy to fake sincerity. For devil’s advocates to be maximally effective, they need to really believe in the position they’re representing—and the group needs to believe that they believe it, too. (2905)
- And even if a devil’s advocate did believe in the minority perspective, informing the other members that the role had been assigned was enough to undermine the advocate’s persuasiveness.* Whereas people doubt assigned dissenters, genuine dissenters challenge people to doubt themselves. (2910)
- Compared to assigned dissenters, authentic dissenters don’t make group members substantially angrier, and they’re actually liked slightly more (at least they have principles). (2916)
- In the language of futurist Paul Saffo, the norm is to have “strong opinions, weakly held.” (2935)
- If employees can get in sync about making sure that everyone speaks up, they don’t need to worry as much about groupthink. (2943)
- Hofmann found that a culture that focuses too heavily on solutions becomes a culture of advocacy, dampening inquiry. If you’re always expected to have an answer ready, you’ll arrive at meetings with your diagnosis complete, missing out on the chance to learn from a broad range of perspectives. (2965)
- When every member of a group has different information, inquiry needs to precede advocacy—which means you have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions. (2973)
- To ensure that authentic dissenters voiced their viewpoints earlier, Bock’s team created the “Canaries”—a group of trusted engineers across the company who represent diverse viewpoints, and have a reputation both for being sensitive to adverse conditions and for speaking their minds. (2981)
- They’re part advisory board, part focus group, and they’ve become an invaluable safeguard to make sure Googlers’ voices are heard. (2984)
- Getting problems noted is half the battle against groupthink; the other is listening to the right opinions about how to solve them. The Bridgewater procedure for the latter is to gather a group of credible people to diagnose the problems, share their reasoning, and explore the causes and possible solutions. (2992)
- At Bridgewater, every employee has a believability score on a range of dimensions. (2997)
- If you’re about to interact with a few Bridgewater colleagues for the first time, you can see their track records on seventy-seven different dimensions of values, skills, and abilities in the areas of higher-level thinking, practical thinking, maintaining high standards, determination, open-mindedness yet assertiveness, and organization and reliability. (3001)
- In presenting your views, you’re expected to consider your own believability by telling your audience how confident you are. If you have doubts, and you’re not known as believable in the domain, you shouldn’t have an opinion in the first place; you’re supposed to ask questions so you can learn. If you’re expressing a fierce conviction, you should be forthright about it—but know that your colleagues will probe the quality of your reasoning. Even then, you’re supposed to be assertive and open-minded at the same time. (3011)
- Instead of leaving it to the management committee to resolve, though, Dalio asked Greg and Trina to collaborate on turning their conflict into a case to share with all of Bridgewater. Along with making their debate transparent, it forced them to inquire about each other’s perspectives instead of just advocating for their own viewpoints. (3039)
- Even if your organization doesn’t currently embrace critical upward feedback, holding an open season on leaders might be an effective way to begin changing the culture. (3048)
- By role modeling receptivity to feedback, employees across the company became more willing to challenge him—and one another. (3050)
- I’ve learned to do something similar in the classroom. I collect anonymous feedback from students after the first month, focusing on constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, and then email the full set of verbatim comments to the entire class. In the next class session, I summarize what I thought were the key suggestions, seek feedback on my interpretations, and propose changes to address these issues. (3051)
- It’s not just Dalio’s openness that makes people comfortable challenging senior leaders. It’s the fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the principles. (3056)
- By the time we’re up to speed, we’re already swamped with work and beginning to see the world in the company way. The early period is the perfect time for employees to pay attention to opportunities to improve the culture. (3059)
- A few years ago, I was hired by Goldman Sachs to identify steps for attracting and retaining talented investment banking analysts and associates by allowing them to improve the work environment. One of the initiatives that we introduced was an entry interview. (3060)
- I’d come to believe that no one had the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up about it, (3071)
- principles appeared in a list, without any information about which one mattered more. After studying values for more than forty years, psychologist Shalom Schwartz has found that their main purpose is to help people choose between conflicting options. (3075)
- I pointed out to Dalio that when organizations fail to prioritize principles, their performance suffers. (3077)
- I added that establishing relative importance is especially essential when organizations have a large number of principles. (3082)
- The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on different values or interpret the same values differently. (3087)
- A lightbulb went off for me: We have lots of categories to describe people’s personalities, but few frameworks for describing the personalities of situations. Now I saw the value of having a large number of these principles, but I still wanted to know which ones mattered most. (3091)
- Dalio’s default approach to resolving problems like the disagreement between Greg and Trina is to unearth three believable people with strong opinions from each side, and have them discuss and debate until they’re in sync. (3102)
- humanity has developed a tool more powerful than debate for resolving disagreement. It’s called science. (3107)
- In the field of medicine, I told Dalio, there’s widespread consensus among experts that the quality of evidence can be classified on a scale of strength from one to six. The gold standard is a series of randomized, controlled experiments with objective outcomes. The least rigorous evidence: “the opinion of respected authorities or expert committees.” The same standards are part of the growing field of evidence-based management and people analytics, in which leaders are encouraged to design experiments and gather data instead of relying solely on logic, experience, intuition, and conversation. (3107)
- This time, Dalio disagreed. “I might be wrong,” he qualified, but he explained that he favored the debate format between believable people, because it was the fastest way to reach the right answer and it enabled them to learn from each other’s reasoning. (3117)
- He believes that thoughtful disagreement between experts creates an efficient marketplace of ideas, where the best ones emerge over time. Here, we agreed to disagree. (3120)
- Of course, all of them were driven and imaginative, but I was intrigued by three other qualities on Dalio’s list. “Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and rebellious. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act in the face of risk, because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear of failing. (3128)
- The greatest shapers don’t stop at introducing originality into the world. They create cultures that unleash originality in others. (3132)
- Those who aced the emotion regulation test spoke up more often with ideas and suggestions to challenge the status quo—and their managers rated them as more effective in doing so. (3160)
- Psychologist Julie Norem studies two different strategies for handling these challenges: strategic optimism and defensive pessimism. Strategic optimists anticipate the best, staying calm and setting high expectations. Defensive pessimists expect the worst, feeling anxious and imagining all the things that can go wrong. (3172)
- although defensive pessimists are more anxious and less confident in analytical, verbal, and creative tasks, they perform just as well as strategic optimists. (3177)
- Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the difficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan. (3191)
- Brooks asked them to speak three words out loud. She randomly assigned them to say either “I am calm” or “I am excited.” (3215)
- Rather than trying to suppress a strong emotion, it’s easier to convert it into a different emotion—one that’s equally intense, but propels us to step on the gas. (3230)
- Physiologically, we have a stop system and a go system. (3231)
- Fear is marked by uncertainty about the future: We’re worried that something bad will happen. But because the event hasn’t occurred yet, there’s also a possibility, however slim, that the outcome will be positive. (3234)
- When we’re not yet committed to a particular action, thinking like a defensive pessimist can be hazardous. (3237)
- But once we’ve settled on a course of action, when anxieties creep in, it’s better to think like a defensive pessimist and confront them directly. (3240)
- Originality brings more bumps in the road, yet it leaves us with more happiness and a greater sense of meaning. (3280)
- In a series of experiments, Dave Hofmann and I found that the most inspiring way to convey a vision is to outsource it to the people who are actually affected by it. (3298)
- In later studies, I found that people are inspired to achieve the highest performance when leaders describe a vision and then invite a customer to bring it to life with a personal story. The leader’s message provides an overarching vision to start the car, and the user’s story offers an emotional appeal that steps on the accelerator. (3308)
- Just flying solo with an opinion can make even a committed original fearful enough to conform to the majority. (3344)
- The easiest way to encourage non-conformity is to introduce a single dissenter. (3345)
- Merely knowing that you’re not the only resister makes it substantially easier to reject the crowd. (3349)
- Research by Sigal Barsade and Hakan Ozcelik shows that in business and government organizations, just having one friend is enough to significantly decrease loneliness. (3352)
- If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re not alone. (3353)
- Later, when members of the movement were arrested, police officers asked them who was in charge. Popovic and his friends trained them to introduce themselves as “one of 20,000 leaders of Otpor!” (3357)
- Around the world, resistance movements have helped people overcome fear by turning on the go system with small actions that signal the support of a larger group. (3359)
- It’s easier to rebel when it feels like an act of conformity. Other people are involved, so we can join, too. (3373)
- In his workshops, Popovic trains revolutionaries to use humor as a weapon against fear. (3385)
- It’s hard to be afraid of speaking up when you’re laughing at the target of your rebellion. (3389)
- Effective displays of humor are what Popovic calls dilemma actions: choices that put oppressors in a lose-lose situation. (3390)
- The distinguishing factor was a sense of urgency. To convince leaders to sponsor the issue, create a task force, and spend time and money on it, the environmental champions had to articulate why the original cause needed to be adopted now. (3430)
- Logically, these are the same options as the first set of choices. But psychologically, they don’t feel the same. (3445)
- we tend to be risk averse in the domain of benefits. When we have a certain gain, we like to hold on to it and protect it. (3448)
- we’re presented with a guaranteed loss. Now, we’re willing to do whatever it takes to avoid that loss, even if it means risking an even bigger one. (3450)
- If you want people to modify their behavior, is it better to highlight the benefits of changing or the costs of not changing? (3455)
- According to Peter Salovey, (3456)
- If they think the behavior is safe, we should emphasize all the good things that will happen if they do it—they’ll want to act immediately to obtain those certain gains. But when people believe a behavior is risky, that approach doesn’t work. (3457)
- Instead, we need to destabilize the status quo and accentuate the bad things that will happen if they don’t change. Taking a risk is more appealing when they’re faced with a guaranteed loss if they don’t. (3459)
- This “kill the company” exercise is powerful because it reframes a gain-framed activity in terms of losses. When deliberating about innovation opportunities, the leaders weren’t inclined to take risks. When they considered how their competitors could put them out of business, they realized that it was a risk not to innovate. The urgency of innovation was apparent. (3466)
- If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with the present. To drive people out of their comfort zones, you have to cultivate dissatisfaction, frustration, or anger at the current state of affairs, making it a guaranteed loss. (3470)
- “The greatest communicators of all time,” says communication expert Nancy Duarte—who has spent her career studying the shape of superb presentations—start by establishing “what is: here’s the status quo.” Then, they “compare that to what could be,” making “that gap as big as possible.” (3472)
- The audience was only prepared to be moved by his dream of tomorrow after he had exposed the nightmare of today. (3487)
- Psychologists Minjung Koo and Ayelet Fishbach find that when we’re experiencing doubts on the way toward achieving a goal, whether we ought to look backward or forward depends on our commitment. (3488)
- When our commitment is wavering, the best way to stay on track is to consider the progress we’ve already made. (3489)
- Once commitment is fortified, instead of glancing in the rearview mirror, it’s better to look forward by highlighting the work left to be done. When we’re determined to reach an objective, it’s the gap between where we are and where we aspire to be that lights a fire under us. (3493)
- “Instead of courage,” management guru Tom Peters recommends fostering “a level of fury with the status quo such that one cannot not act.” (3501)
- Anger counteracts apathy: We feel that we’ve been wronged, and we’re compelled to fight. But it can also go too far. (3503)
- After studying activists, Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully suggest that the key is to be “simultaneously hot- and cool-headed. The heat fuels action and change; the coolness shapes the action and change into legitimate and viable forms.” But once the heat is on, how do we keep our cool? (3505)
- According to Berkeley sociologist Arlie Hochschild, if you’re feeling an intense emotion like anxiety or anger, there are two ways to manage it: surface acting and deep acting. (3508)
- Surface acting involves putting on a mask—modifying your speech, gestures, and expressions to present yourself as unfazed. (3509)
- In deep acting, known as method acting in the theater world, you actually become the character you wish to portray. Deep acting involves changing your inner feelings, not just your outer expressions of them. (3515)
- Deep acting dissolves the distinction between your true self and the role you are playing. (3518)
- Deep acting turns out to be a more sustainable strategy for managing emotions than surface acting. Research shows that surface acting burns us out: (3526)
- What would be the best way to handle their anger? (3538)
- Venting doesn’t extinguish the flame of anger; it feeds it. (3555)
- In other studies, Bushman has demonstrated that venting doesn’t work even if you think it does—and even if it makes you feel good. The better you feel after venting, the more aggressive you get: not only toward your critic, but also toward innocent bystanders. (3558)
- One of the fundamental problems with venting is that it focuses attention on the perpetrator of injustice. (3565)
- To channel anger productively, instead of venting about the harm that a perpetrator has done, we need to reflect on the victims who have suffered from it. (3570)
- Management researchers Andrew Brodsky, Joshua Margolis, and Joel Brockner find that focusing on the victims of injustice spurs us to speak truth to power. (3571)
- Focusing on the victim activates what psychologists call empathetic anger—the desire to right wrongs done unto another. It turns on the go system, but it makes us thoughtful about how to best respect the victim’s dignity. (3577)
- Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation or revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better system. (3578)
- Becoming original is not the easiest path in the pursuit of happiness, but it leaves us perfectly poised for the happiness of pursuit. (3592)
- Individual Actions: (3599)
- A. Generating and Recognizing Original Ideas (3600)
- 1. Question the default. (3601)
- 2. Triple the number of ideas you generate. (3603)
- 3. Immerse yourself in a new domain. (3605)
- 4. Procrastinate strategically. (3611)
- 5. Seek more feedback from peers. (3613)
- B. Voicing and Championing Original Ideas (3617)
- 6. Balance your risk portfolio. (3618)
- 7. Highlight the reasons not to support your idea. (3621)
- 8. Make your ideas more familiar. (3625)
- 9. Speak to a different audience. (3629)
- Instead of seeking out friendly people who share your values, try approaching disagreeable people who share your methods. (3629)
- 10. Be a tempered radical. (3634)
- If your idea is extreme, couch it in a more conventional goal. (3635)
- C. Managing Emotions (3640)
- 11. Motivate yourself differently when you’re committed vs. uncertain. (3640)
- When you’re determined to act, focus on the progress left to go—you’ll be energized to close the gap. When your conviction falters, think of the progress you’ve already made. (3641)
- 12. Don’t try to calm down. (3643)
- It’s easier to turn anxiety into intense positive emotions like interest and enthusiasm. (3643)
- 13. Focus on the victim, not the perpetrator. (3645)
- 14. Realize you’re not alone. (3649)
- 15. Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the status quo will persist. (3651)
- Consider the four responses to dissatisfaction: exit, voice, persistence, and neglect. Only exit and voice improve your circumstances. (3652)
- Leader Actions: (3654)
- A. Sparking Original Ideas (3655)
- 1. Run an innovation tournament. (3655)
- Instead of a suggestion box, send a focused call for ideas to solve a particular problem or meet an untapped need. (3657)
- 2. Picture yourself as the enemy. (3660)
- You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from Lisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. (3661)
- 3. Invite employees from different functions and levels to pitch ideas. (3665)
- 4. Hold an opposite day. (3670)
- divide into groups, and each chooses an assumption, belief, or area of knowledge that is widely taken for granted. Each group asks, “When is the opposite true?” and then delivers a presentation on their ideas. (3671)
- 5. Ban the words like, love, and hate. (3673)
- they have to explain their reasoning (3676)
- B. Building Cultures of Originality (3679)
- 6. Hire not on cultural fit, but on cultural contribution. (3680)
- 7. Shift from exit interviews to entry interviews. (3683)
- Instead of waiting to ask for ideas until employees are on their way out the door, start seeking their insights when they first arrive. (3684)
- Ask what brought them in the door and what would keep them at the firm, and challenge them to think like culture detectives. They can use their insider-outsider perspectives to investigate which practices belong in a museum and which should be kept, as well as potential inconsistencies between espoused and enacted values. (3685)
- 8. Ask for problems, not solutions. (3688)
- 9. Stop assigning devil’s advocates and start unearthing them. (3692)
- To identify these people, try appointing an information manager—make someone responsible for seeking out team members individually before meetings to find out what they know. (3694)
- 10. Welcome criticism. (3696)
- Parent and Teacher Actions: (3699)
- 1. Ask children what their role models would do. (3700)
- 2. Link good behaviors to moral character. (3703)
- you see a child do something good, try saying, “You’re a good person because you .” (3705)
- Children are also more ethical when they’re asked to be moral people—they want to earn the identity. (3706)
- 3. Explain how bad behaviors have consequences for others. (3707)
- 4. Emphasize values over rules. (3710)
- 5. Create novel niches for children to pursue. (3713)
- One of my favorite techniques is the Jigsaw Classroom: bring students together for a group project, and assign each of them a unique part. (3715)
- Psychologist Andrea Hollingshead finds that when groups are instructed to rank order the alternatives, instead of choosing the best alternative, they’re more likely to consider each option, share information about the unpopular ones, and make a good decision. (6053)
- Negative thoughts can direct our attention to potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to take preventative and corrective actions. (6058)
- Psychologist James Pennebaker has demonstrated that expressing our thoughts and feelings about a stressful or traumatic event is most salutary after we’ve had some time to process the event, when we’re not blinded by anger or consumed by distress. (6091)
