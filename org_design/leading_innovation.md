# Leading Innovation

* Oversimplification: Creativity + Implementation = Innovation
* Best diagnostic question: What happens when people fail? (Do you forgive and remember? Innovation is not possible without failure).
* Innovation means SELLING, not just inventing, ideas, experiences, and products.
* Pay attention to how you impact those around you, after interacting do they have more or less energy? Ensure you have their back, reward/appreciate them, and push them hard (but not too hard)

## Intersections

* Creativity almost always stems from creating new combinations of old and new ideas.
* Speed up creativity by being an idea collector; Seek new ideas, new contexts for old ideas, and new combinations of ideas.
* Leave time for introspection/perspective to synthesize/process your ideas.
* If something makes you squirm a bit, it may be worth paying attention to as it is pushing on existing boundaries/sensibilities.

## Innovative vs Routine Work

* Innovative Work
  * Seeks to increase variation, and accepts a corresponding high failure rate
  * Worth explicitly calling out when/where rapid learning is expected (and correspondingly where failure is acceptable)
  * A great shortcut can be getting perspective from someone who is an expert, just not an expert in this area of focus.
  * Benefits from blurring the lines between execution and reflection.
  * Sometimes you will need to shelve good ideas (in addition to the bad ones) to minimize distraction and push for the very best ideas.
  * Prototype as if you are right and listen as if you are wrong.
  * You only learn when things start breaking and/or failure sucks but instructs.
* Routine Work
  * Seeks to drive out variation and failure
   Benefits from keeping execution and reflection as distinct efforts.
* Balancing Innovative and Routine Work
  * Be transparent about expectations: timeline, who is involved, how it relates to existing work, etc.
  * Keep both styles integrated through regular check-ins to maintain engagement, provide feedback/insight/perspective/etc.

## Leadership Fundamentals

* Self Awareness
  * Pay attention to and iterate on how it feels to work for you, how you come across, how you get the best for others, etc.
  * Be wary of power poisoning, where getting power can lead to focusing on your own needs/concerns more than those of others, acting like rules don't apply to you, self-evaluating delusionally, etc
  * Balance "back stage" and "front stage" behaviors and beware the toxic tandem, which is caused by the combination of overattentive subordinates and inattentive bosses.
  * Ask good questions, listen to everyone, and then synthesize your own answer.
* Assertiveness
  * "first do no harm", be cautious of overestimating your value and/or underestimating the cost of interjecting.
  * Don't intervene on divergent tasks if ideas are being generated, everyone is participating, etc.
  * Do intervene on convergent tasks if a decision needs to be made, things need to move forward, etc.
  * Set clear boundaries/expectations around when to expect intervention to provide predictability and consistency.
* Small Wins
  * Long term strategy is essential, but without a tactical plan people may freeze up/freak out. (see also: The Progress Principle book)
  * Frame big things as a series of managable/doable steps; leads to better decisions, more sustained motivation, and reduces freak outs.
  * Celebrate progress (big and small) and those that contributed and communicate it broadly.
  * Provide a map of upcoming goals and why they matter.
  * Support continuos progress by providing goals/resources/time and reducing obstacles.
  * Insist people support one another and look for opportunities to support each others progress every day.
* Having Backs
  * Protect people from harm, intrusion, distraction, indignities, idiots, and idiocy (from yourself and/or others).
  * Ensure meetings are valuable for all participants, for the duration or change things. Avoid power grab meetings (demonstrating your relative power to command/control other's time).

## Building Innovative Teams

* Stars spread ideas, borrow ideas, and help others succeed as members of a team and network.
* Put more faith in novices (and less in experts) by blending the two as a counter to "strong ideas, strongly held" and to account for different strengths/weaknesses
* Problem members should get fast feedback and/or removal; negative is more resonant that positive, so it can quickly become distracting and contagious
* Make clear goals, be explicit about what is negotiable, and enforce both.
* "assholes are those who consistently put their own needs in front of the needs of the organization, colleagues, and customers"
* Avoid double digit team sizes, performance problems increase ~exponentially with team size. Optimal is 4.6, one in charge and the rest to execute.
* Stable teams are linked to improved performance over time.
* Grok the team gestalt through intuitive metrics
  * Is there a sense of enlightened action from people having sufficient focus/direction?
  * Is there some angst? (if not, you probably aren't pushing limits)
  * Are people expressing dignity, elegance, and joy?

## Running Innovative Teams

* Optimism, Pessimism, and Self-fulfilling Prophecies
  * Innovation requires optimism to help push through failure and setbacks.
  * Innovation requires some grumpy pessimism to point out flaws, overcome sunk cost bias, etc. As negative can be contagious, consider only applying this periodically and otherwise keep it isolated.
  * A happy medium may be optimism around strategy/broad and worry around tactics/details.
  * Give permission to be creative (to as many people as possible), especially if they don't already consider their role to be a creative one.
* Money Rewards
  * Many studies indicate people work harder toward financial rewards, but they do so as selfish loners and it it really hard to properly connect rewards and desired behaviors.
  * It is really common to end up designing a reward with that creates incentives to do a behavior contradictory to the one desired.
  * Being reminded of money causes: less likely to help others, less likely to seek help, sit further apart, more likely to work alone, etc. (Kathleen Vohs experiments)
* Intrinsic Rewards - autonomy, mastery, purpose (see Drive book)
* Stand-up Meetings - literally stand while meeting, tend to be comparably effective while ~34% shorter.
* How and When to Fight
  * Respect one another, yet fight over ideas. ie strong opinions, loosely held.
  * Fight like you are right, listen like you are wrong; and teach your people to do the same.
  * Focus fighting on convergent tasks, as it is counterproductive to divergent tasks.
  * Fighting is productive as long as it results in a decision (otherwise it is toxic).
  * Stop fighting after a decision as made (disagree and commit), or you will undermine implementation.

## Implementation

* Smart talk happens now, smart action happens later. Be wary of rewarding smart talk rather than smart action.
* Decisions by themself change nothing, action is required.
* How to avoid the smart-talk trap:
  * Put people in management who understand the work
  * Root out complaints/whining and drive action (some recreational whining can be a good release valve, but constant and/or bitter complaining is toxic)
  * Focus on simple language and repitition to deliver something that is easily understood and actionable.
  * Simpler strategies are easier to implement.
* Be explicit about when you are undertaking focus/convergent tasks vs flare/divergent tasks.
* Convergence shelves ideas, not destroys them, they will often come back in the future.
* Constraints are a valuable part of the creative process.
