# Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter

* Multipliers:
  * Hold themselves to the highest standards, offering their very best.
  * Multipliers stretch people, getting more than they knew they had to give.
  * Resource allocation gets too much attention compared to resource leverage.
  * Instead of achieving linear growth by adding new resources, focus on more efficiently extracting capabilities from existing resources.
  * Not about getting more with less, but getting more by using more.
  * See intelligence as continually developing.
  * "In what way is this person smart? What could be done to develop and grow these capabilities?"
  * Bring smart people together in an environment that liberates everyone's best thinking--and then get out of the way and let them do it!
  * Utilizes and increases everyone's genius.
  * Liberator creating a safe environment that fosters bold thinking.
  * Challenger who defines opportunities.
  * Debate makers who generate real buy-in.
  * Investor who gives others ownership and full accountaility.
  * Look into people and find capability, expect great things, and drive them to extraordinary results.
  * Don't shrink so that others can be big, they play in a way that invites others to play big too.
  * Don't take themselves or situations too seriously.
  * Get, on average, twice the capability from someone they lead.
* Diminishers:
  * Intelligence is elite and scarce, and other people will never figure things out without help.
  * See intelligence as something basic/static about people.
  * Empire builder who acquires resources and wastes them.
  * Tyrant who creates a stressful environment.
  * Know-it-all who gives directives.
  * Decision makers who try to sell their decisions to others.
  * Micromanager who jumps in and out.
  * Tend not to understand the restrictive impact they were having on others.

## Talent Magnet

* Know genius comes in many forms, attract talented people and use them to their fullest.
* They are blind to organizational/heirarchical/lateral boundaries and instead see talent networks.
* Understand people love to contribute their genius, so by finding it they open a pathway for that peorson to contribute.
* Know how to uncover and access native genius of others.
* Native genius/talent is something that people do not only exceptionally well, but also easily (without extra effort) and freely (without condition).
* After uncovering native genius, looks for opportunities that demand that capability.
* By telling people what you see, you can raise their awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capaility more fully.
* After engaging the person's genius, they shine a spotlight so others can see their genius in action.
* In addition to giving people resources, they remove impediments, including people who might be blocking or impeding growth.
* "Ignore me as needed to get your job done."
* Most try to retain top players, the best leaders also know when they have outgrown their environment and it's time to let them go.
* Empire Builders:
  * Seek to surround themselves with A players to appear smarter and more powerful, hoarding resources and underutilizing talent.
  * Ensure they are the point of integration.
  * "developing the talent of the team" was amoung the lowest three skills of the Diminisher

## Liberator

* Operates as a peer to everyone they work with and is accessible to all. As a result, people are more transparent.
* Create open, comfortable environment where people can think freely and contribute. When more power is needed they invoke their demanding side which commands only the best performance from others.
* Create an intense environment which requires concentration, diligence, and energy. People are encouraged to think for themselves and experience a deep obligation to do their best work.
* Create an environment where good things happen. Create conditions where intelligence is engaged, grown, and transformed into success.
* When decisions are collective, mistakes are too. No one person takes the blame. Teams do postmortems and learn how to avoid the error.
* Create both comfort and pressure in an exchange: they give space and expect to get back others' best work. Requiring best work is different from insisting on a desired outcome.
* As a manager you know when someone is below their usual performance. It's harder to know if someone is giving everything they have. Asking whether people are offering their best gives opportunity to push beyond previous limits.
* People's best thinking must be given, not taken. Instead of demanding best work, create an environment where it can not only be offered, but where it is deeply needed.
* Amplify voices to extract maximum intelligence and give advantage to ideas and voices on the lower end of the playing field.
* More than good listeners, ferocious listeners. List to feed their hunger for knowldeg, to learn what other people know and add it to their own reservoir of knowledge.
* During a crisis, they ask even more questions that force you to really think through a situation. You feel their stealthy hand guiding decisions.
* Wisdom comes from all across the organization. But as a leader you have to do more than just not discourage it, you need to actively encourage people to speak up. The leader has to ask questions and invite the most junior people to express ideas.
* Define space for experimentation by clarifying the area where it's okay to fail versus when failure isn't an option.
* If you want your org to take risks, you must seperate experiment from outcome. Have zero tolerance for not running/executing the experiment, but don't hold them accountable for the outcome.
* Create rapid cycle of thinking, learning, making/recovering from mistakes to generate the best ideas and create and agile organization.
* Give space to make mistakes, but expect people to learn from them. Another exchange: they give permission to make mistakes and expect them to be learned from and not repeated. When we help people see a path to recovery, we spawn a learning cycle.
* By making mistakes public, you make it safe for others to take risks and fail. Instead of talking about mistakes behind closed doors or one-on-one, bring them out in the open where the person making the mistake can clear the air and everyone can learn. Make it part of your management ritual.
* Divide views into "soft opinions" where you have perspective to offer and ideas for others to consider and "hard opinions" where you have a clear and potentially emphatic point of view.
* Limit your own contributions to leave space for others. It's a small victory to create space for others to contribute. It is a huge victory to maintain the space and resist the temptation to jump back in and consume it yourself.
* There is no easier way to invite experimentation and learning than to share stories about your own mistakes. Let people know about mistakes you have made and what you have learned from them.
* Tyrants:
  * create a tense environment of stress and anxiety.

## Challenger

* Peter Drucker - "number one difference between a Nobel Prize winner and others is not IQ or work ethic, but that they ask bigger questions."
* Get the entire org to take a small, first step. Do it together so everyone can see the results and start to believe that something great is possible.
* Start with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward greater stretch challenges.
* Bad leaders tell people what to do. Good leaders ask questions and let their people figure out the answers. Great leaders ask questions that focus the intelligence of their team on the right problems.
* The question "why" s at the core of their thinking and takes the form of an insatiable need for deep organizational understanding.
* Engage you team by giving them a "mission impossible", a hard, concrete challenge that wil stretch them and develop new capailities.
* When leaders offer a challenge and create a culture of belief, the organization steps up.
* Invite others to explore the impossible, the uncertain, uncomfortable places that stretch both imagition and capabilities.
* Instead of knowing the answer, use smarts to find opportunities for the org and challenge/stretch the org to get there. Push beyond their own knowledge and that of the organization.
* Assumes that people get smarter and stronger by being challenged.
* By accepting they don't have all the answers, challenger's are free to ask much bigger, more provocative, and, frankly, more interesting questions. They can pursue things they don't know how to do.
* Asks questions that challenge fundamental assumptions and disrupt prevailing logic.
* Analyze problems, but also reframe them to show opportunities presented by challenges.
* Help people see the need that must be met. Make it a learning experience that will reveal need, create energy, and ignite a fire within your org.
* First, extend a clear and concrete challenge. Then ask hard questions that need to be answered, but -most important- don't answer them. Let others fill in the blanks.
* Instead of telling others answers, provide just enough information to provoke thinking and help people discover and see opportunities, share things like the fundamental questions, trends, and assumptions shaping their views.
* Provide a starting point, not a complete solution. Thereby generating more questions than answers, which encourage their team to fully define the opportunity while gaining confidence they are building a solid foundation.
* When others see the need for themselves, they develop a deep understanding, and often all the leader needs to do is get out of their way and let them solve the problem.
* By asking hard questions and inviting others to fill in the blanks, the burden of thinking is shifted to other people. The onus sits with the team to understand the challeng and find a solution.
* Create space between what people know and what they need to know, drawing them into the challenge.
* Make challenges more concrete (tangible/measurable) to allow others to visualize the achievement and communicate confidence that the org has what is required.
* Ask hard questions that challenge people not only to think, but to rethink. Ask such immense questions that people can't answer them based on current knowledge and where they stand. To answer these, the organization must learn.
* Generate the belief that the impossible is actually possible. It isn't enough to see and understand the stretch, people actually need to stretch themselves.
* Accelerate performance because org doesn't have to wait for leader to tell them something or approve.
* Start by developing an overactive and imagination and serious case of curiosity.
* Diminishers:
  * Overly focused on what they know, thereby limiting what the organization can achiev to what they themselves know how to do.
  * Instead of enabling stretching toward future opportunity, give direction in a way that showcases their own knowledge. Instead of seeding opportunity and laying out believable challenge, they tell an dtest.
  * Tend to sell their ideas rather than learning what others know.
  * Ask questions to make a point rather than gain greater insight or generate collective learning.
  * Rather than shifting responsibility, they stay in charge and tell others -in detail- how to do their jobs. They give themselves permission to generate both questions and answers.

## Debate Maker

* Practices of debate maker:
  * Frame the issue:
    * Define the question.
    * Form the team.
    * Assemble the data.
    * Frame the decision.
  * Spark the debate:
    * Create safety for best thinking.
    * Demand rigor.
  * Drive a sound decision:
    * Reclarify the decision-making process
    * Make the decision
    * Communicate the decision and rationale
* Ask for debate with four asks: ask the hard questions, ask for evidence, ask everyone, and ask people to switch.
* Make decisions by first engaging in debate - not only to achieve sound decisions, but also to develop collective intelligence and to ready orgs to execute.
* Focus not on what they know, but on how to know what others know. Operate on an assumption that with enough good minds, we can figure it out.
* Creating debate is easy, creating rigorous debate requires a deliberate approach. Well-crafted frame has four parts:
  * The Question: What is the decision to be made? What are we choosing between?
  * The Why: Why is this an important question to answer? Why does the decision warrant collective input anddeate? What happens if it is not addressed?
  * The Who: Who will be involved in making the decision? Who will give input?
  * The How: How will the final decision be made? Will it be made by majority rule? Consensus? Or will you (or someone else) make the final decision after others provide input and recommendations?
* Framing an issue well lets the team know where to focus. They know what is in and out of bounds.
* A common mistake is to debate a topic rather than a question. The most productive debates answer well-defined questions with clear, often mutually exclusive options.
* Teams often come to the soundest decisions when they come in having an established, clear opening position.
* Great debate is:
  * Engaging: The question is compelling and important to everyone in attendance.
  * Comprehensive: The right information is shared to generate a holistic and collective understanding of the issues at hand.
  * Fact Based: Debate is deeply rooted in fact, not opinion.
  * Educational: People leave the debate more focused on what they learned than on who won or lost.
* Two key elements to great debate: Creating safety and demanding rigor.
* Demand rigor by:
  * Asking questions that challenge conventional thinking.
  * Ask qusetions that unearth assumptions that are holding the organization back.
  * Ask questions that cause the team to think harder and dig deeper.
  * Ask for evidence.
* Pursue all sides of the issue. If agreement is moved toward too quickly, step back and ask for the other point of view to be argued.
* After asking people to come prepared with an opening position, consider having them drop this and argue the opposite.
* May relish debate, but only in pursuit of a sound decision. Ensure this by:
  * Reclarifying the decision-making process.
  * Make the decision or explicitly delegate it to someone to decide.
  * Communicate the decision and the rationale.
* Answer questions such as:
  * Are we making the decision right now, or do we need more information?
  * Is this a team decision, or will the leader make the final call? If it is a team decision, how will we resolve any differing views?
  * Has anything that has surfaced in the debate altered the decision-making process?
* Generate and leverage collective thinking. May seek full consensus, but equally comfortable making the final decision.
* As people watch debate, they come to a better understandinfg of the issue. When decisions are reached, people at all levels are ready to execute. Makes communicating decisions and rationale easier because org is already prepared to move forward.
* Rules of shared inquiry:
  * Discussion leader only asks questions.
  * Students must supply evidence to support their theories.
  * Everyone participates.
  * (optionally) Ask people to switch positions.
* Let people weigh in, and they will give you buy-in.
* Diminishers:
  * Bring issues/decisions to others' attention, but don't frame it in a way that allows others to contribute. Focus on what of decision, rather than how or why.
  * Tend to dominate discussion/debate with their own ideas.
  * Rather than driving sound decisions, tend to force decisions either by relying heavily on their own opinion or by shortcutting rigorous debate.
  * At first glance, may appear to be making efficient decisions, however it leaves the broader organization in the dark (not understanding assumptions/facts). Lacking clarity, people turn to debating the soundness of a decision rather than executing it.

## Investor

* "A leader is someone who helps others lead"
* Teach and Coach.
* Offer suggestions, ask questions and highlight/escalate critical issues, but always return accountaility. Use statements like: "I'm happy to help think this through, but I'm looking to you to lead this.", "You are still lead on this", or "I'm here to back you up; What do you need from me as you lead this?"
* "You're smart. You figure it out." Validate ideas and give back onus for solving to them.
* Returning ownership creates self-sufficiency, avoiding dependent organizations.
* Give 51 perent of the vote and full ownership to create certainty and build confidence. Replaces second guessing with getting second opinions.
* When only given ownership of a piece, people tend to overfit to their portion. With ownership of the whole they stretch their thinking and scope.
* By stretching a role you create a vacuum that much be filled and stretch the person in it.
* After establishing ownership, protect your investment by infusing the knowledge and resources needed to deliver
* Provide backup, ensure a safety net is in place, a planned backup that can be gone to for advice on how to recover gracefully.
* Expect Complete Work. Offer solutions, not just problems. Never do anything for other people that they can do for themselves.
* Ask for the F-I-X - ask for the complete thought process and a fix. Use simple questions like: What solution(s) do you see to this problem? How would you propose we solve this? What would you like to do to fix this?
* Respect Natural Consequences. When we protect people from the ramifications of their actions, we stunt their learning. Real intelligence gets developed through experimentation and by trial and error. Also allow people to experience the full force of their success.
* Manage the work, not do the work.
* Diminishers tell you what they know; multipliers help you learn what you need to know.
* Diminishers:
  * Maintain Ownership - dole out piecemeal tasks, but not real responsiility.
  * Jump In and Out
  * Take it Back - hand over work, but take it back the moment problems arise.

## Accidental Diminisher

* Types of Accidental Diminishers:
  * Idea Guy - Believe tossing around more ideas will spark more ideas of others. But new ideas all the time can be exhausting, and and others chase these ideas they will stop coming up with their own.
  * Always On - Assuming energy is contagiuous, but enervates rather than energizing. Can supress introverts while allowing action-oriented extroverts to dominate. If the leader is always on, everyone else is always off.
  * Rescuer - When managers help too soon and too often, others become dependent and helpless. Sometimes we are most helpful when we don't help.
  * Pacesetter - The faster we run, the slower others walk. When leaders set the pace, they are more likely to create spectators than followers.
  * Rapid Responder - Tend to generate low-grade apathy instead of agility, as others will respond slower if someone is already "on it". Not only will the leader end up being the only responder, but they will be the only one growing as well.
  * Optimist - If the leader sees only upside, others can become preoccupied with downside. Sometimes others want acknowledgement of challenge and recognition of struggle.
  * Protector - If people are always protected from danger, they never learn to fend for themselves.
  * Strategist - People spend time second-guessing rather than finding their own answers. If you have a reputation for big thinking, don't be surprised if others save the big thinking for you.
  * Perfectionist - May see an A+ in progress, but others see nothing but red marks and blue tape all over.
* Self-awareness as a leader comes from understanding the perspectives of those we lead and serve, the "customers" of our leadeship. Learning can start with insight, but can't end there.
* Leading with intention starts with understanding how natural tendencies can take us down the wrong path. Great habits and seemingly strong traits can go awry and become vulnerabilities.
* Holding back doesn't express indifference, but rather a vote of confidence.
* Questions to elicit feedback:
  * How might I be shutting down the ideas and action of others, despite having the best of intentions?
  * What am I inadvertently doing that might be having a diminishing impact on others?
  * How might my intentions be interpreted diferently by others? What messages might my actions actually be conveying?
  * What could I do differently?
* Even the best leaders have blind spots. After identifying yours, work with your team to develop a set of signals and workarounds.
* Although leaders may view their leadership through the lens of positive intentions, staff perceive the same behaviour only by its negative consequences.
* Do less and challenge more. Becoming a multiplier often starts with becoming less of a diminisher. This often means doing less: less talking, less responding, less convincing, and less rescuing of others who need to struggle and learn for themselves.

## Dealing with Diminishers

* Don't wait for perfect behavior, celebrate anything in the right direction.
* Be wary of doubling down when threatened or when your ideas are not heard.
* The best way out of diminishing is to lead like a multiplier yourself.
* Instead of responding with criticism and avoidance, respond with intellectual curiosity.
* Strategies:
  * It's not necessarilly about you.
  * Diminishing isn't inevitable.
  * You can lead your leader.
* Level 1: Defenses Against the Dark Arts of Diminishing Managers
  * Turn Down the Volume - It's easy to assume our contribution isn't being valued; however, in reality, they probably just value their own contribution more.
  * Strengthen Other Connections
  * Retreat and Regroup - Instead of attempting to win, just stay in the game.
  * Send the Rigth Signals - Primary cause of micromanaging is a concern that something won't get completed fully or correctly.
  * Assert Your Capaility - Sometimes you just need to tell someone that you don't need help.
  * Ask for Performance Intel - When things get prescriptive, ask to back up and get more context and direction.
    * What is the target, and why is it important?
    * Am I actually hitting the target?
  * Shop for a New Boss - Note, if you keep being surrounded by diminishers, it may partly be you.
* Level 2: Multiplying Up
  * Exploit Your Boss's Strengths
  * Give Them a User's Guide - Broadcast your capabilities to help colleagues understand, or simply tell them what you are good at and how you can best be used. Give your genious a name and outline specific ways it can be put to work. If you want to work at your highest point of contribution, you need to let people know your value.
  * Listen to Learn - Instead of going into battle, look for common ground.
  * Admit Your Mistakes - Set the tone by admitting mistakes, sharing learning, and letting the boss know you are smarter each time.
  * Sign Up for a Stretch - Send signals that you are ready to tackle a challenge that is a size too big.
  * Invite Them to the Party - When blocked, diminishers work even more aggressively to insert themselves. Transparency signals that all is well and you have nothing to hide. By initiating you maintain more control over how the boss contributes/engages, minimizing bungee-boss dynamics.
* Level 3: Inspiring Multiplier Leadership in Others
  * Assume Positive Intent
  * Address One Issue at a Time - If we unload all our frustrations, diminishers may feel attacked and retreat to what they know best, shutting down ideas that are not their own.
  * Celebrate Progress - Give yourself permission to be better than your boss, and watch the organization take notice.
* You can break the spiral by better asserting your capabilities or becoming the leader you wish you had.

## Becoming a Multiplier

* Near universal three-step reaction to Multipliers: Resonance, realization of accidental diminishing, and resolve to be a multiplier.
* Accelerators:
  * Start with the Assumptions
  * Work the Extremes - Zenger-Folkman study demonstrates leaders don't need to be good at everything. They need mastery of a small number of skills and a lack of showstopping weaknesses. Focus on the extremes of neutralizing weaknesses and topping off strengths.
  * Run an Experiment
  * Brace Yourself for Setbacks - Be kind to yourself as you continue to make mistakes and share your strategy with colleagues who are likely to encourage you along the way.
  * Ask a Colleague - Let a colleague choose your experiment for you. ie If I want to bring out the best in those I lead, which experiment would help me most?
* Encourage and coach self-assessment and adjustment. New beliefs need reinforcement and validation, focus on celebrating and sharing progress.
* Successful implementations typically start in the middle. When execs notice positive outcomes they are quick to join. Start small and build a series of wins.
* Strong cultures have these traits:
  * Common language - Words and phrases that hold common meaning within a community based on opinions, principles and values.
  * Learned behaviors - A set of learned responses to stimuli.
  * Shared beliefs - The accetpance of something as true.
  * Heroes and legends - People who are admired or idealized for their qualities, behavior, and/or achievements and the stories told about their heroic actions.
  * Rituals and norms - Consistent behavior regularly followed by an individual or a group.
* When new ideas become new norms, you have cultivated a sustainable culture.
* Building Deep Culture:
  * Common Language
    * Hold a book talk.
    * Discuss accidental diminishers.
  * Learned Behavior
    * Introduce Multiplier mindsets.
    * Teach Multiplier skills.
    * Fuse Multipliers with daily decisions.
  * Shared Beliefs - Peaks and perimeters are defined. People know what earns hero status and what gets kicked out. Core beliefs aout leadership should be defined and validated more frequently than violated.
    * Codify a leadership ethos.
    * Spotlight Multiplier moments - don't need to wait for an award, spotlight efforts along the way.
    * Measure managers.
  * Rituals and Norms
    * Pilot a Multiplier practice.
    * Integrate practices with business metrics.
* Draw on the power of community to spark and sustain momentum, especially when you encounter setbacks.
