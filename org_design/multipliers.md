# Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter

* Multipliers:
  * Hold themselves to the highest standards, offering their very best.
  * Multipliers stretch people, getting more than they knew they had to give.
  * Resource allocation gets too much attention compared to resource leverage.
  * Instead of achieving linear growth by adding new resources, focus on more efficiently extracting capabilities from existing resources.
  * Not about getting more with less, but getting more by using more.
  * See intelligence as continually developing.
  * "In what way is this person smart? What could be done to develop and grow these capabilities?"
  * Bring smart people together in an environment that liberates everyone's best thinking--and then get out of the way and let them do it!
  * Utilizes and increases everyone's genius.
  * Liberator creating a safe environment that fosters bold thinking.
  * Challenger who defines opportunities.
  * Debate makers who generate real buy-in.
  * Investor who gives others ownership and full accountaility.
  * Look into people and find capability, expect great things, and drive them to extraordinary results.
  * Don't shrink so that others can be big, they play in a way that invites others to play big too.
  * Don't take themselves or situations too seriously.
  * Get, on average, twice the capability from someone they lead.
* Diminishers:
  * Intelligence is elite and scarce, and other people will never figure things out without help.
  * See intelligence as something basic/static about people.
  * Empire builder who acquires resources and wastes them.
  * Tyrant who creates a stressful environment.
  * Know-it-all who gives directives.
  * Decision makers who try to sell their decisions to others.
  * Micromanager who jumps in and out.
  * Tend not to understand the restrictive impact they were having on others.

## Talent Magnet

* Know genius comes in many forms, attract talented people and use them to their fullest.
* They are blind to organizational/heirarchical/lateral boundaries and instead see talent networks.
* Understand people love to contribute their genius, so by finding it they open a pathway for that peorson to contribute.
* Know how to uncover and access native genius of others.
* Native genius/talent is something that people do not only exceptionally well, but also easily (without extra effort) and freely (without condition).
* After uncovering native genius, looks for opportunities that demand that capability.
* By telling people what you see, you can raise their awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capaility more fully.
* After engaging the person's genius, they shine a spotlight so others can see their genius in action.
* In addition to giving people resources, they remove impediments, including people who might be blocking or impeding growth.
* "Ignore me as needed to get your job done."
* Most try to retain top players, the best leaders also know when they have outgrown their environment and it's time to let them go.
* Empire Builders:
  * Seek to surround themselves with A players to appear smarter and more powerful, hoarding resources and underutilizing talent.
  * Ensure they are the point of integration.
  * "developing the talent of the team" was amoung the lowest three skills of the Diminisher

## Liberator

* Operates as a peer to everyone they work with and is accessible to all. As a result, people are more transparent.
* Create open, comfortable environment where people can think freely and contribute. When more power is needed they invoke their demanding side which commands only the best performance from others.
* Create an intense environment which requires concentration, diligence, and energy. People are encouraged to think for themselves and experience a deep obligation to do their best work.
* Create an environment where good things happen. Create conditions where intelligence is engaged, grown, and transformed into success.
* When decisions are collective, mistakes are too. No one person takes the blame. Teams do postmortems and learn how to avoid the error.
* Create both comfort and pressure in an exchange: they give space and expect to get back others' best work. Requiring best work is different from insisting on a desired outcome.
* As a manager you know when someone is below their usual performance. It's harder to know if someone is giving everything they have. Asking whether people are offering their best gives opportunity to push beyond previous limits.
* People's best thinking must be given, not taken. Instead of demanding best work, create an environment where it can not only be offered, but where it is deeply needed.
* Amplify voices to extract maximum intelligence and give advantage to ideas and voices on the lower end of the playing field.
* More than good listeners, ferocious listeners. List to feed their hunger for knowldeg, to learn what other people know and add it to their own reservoir of knowledge.
* During a crisis, they ask even more questions that force you to really think through a situation. You feel their stealthy hand guiding decisions.
* Wisdom comes from all across the organization. But as a leader you have to do more than just not discourage it, you need to actively encourage people to speak up. The leader has to ask questions and invite the most junior people to express ideas.
* Define space for experimentation by clarifying the area where it's okay to fail versus when failure isn't an option.
* If you want your org to take risks, you must seperate experiment from outcome. Have zero tolerance for not running/executing the experiment, but don't hold them accountable for the outcome.
* Create rapid cycle of thinking, learning, making/recovering from mistakes to generate the best ideas and create and agile organization.
* Give space to make mistakes, but expect people to learn from them. Another exchange: they give permission to make mistakes and expect them to be learned from and not repeated. When we help people see a path to recovery, we spawn a learning cycle.
* By making mistakes public, you make it safe for others to take risks and fail. Instead of talking about mistakes behind closed doors or one-on-one, bring them out in the open where the person making the mistake can clear the air and everyone can learn. Make it part of your management ritual.
* Divide views into "soft opinions" where you have perspective to offer and ideas for others to consider and "hard opinions" where you have a clear and potentially emphatic point of view.
* Limit your own contributions to leave space for others. It's a small victory to create space for others to contribute. It is a huge victory to maintain the space and resist the temptation to jump back in and consume it yourself.
* There is no easier way to invite experimentation and learning than to share stories about your own mistakes. Let people know about mistakes you have made and what you have learned from them.
* Tyrants:
  * create a tense environment of stress and anxiety.

## Challenger

* Peter Drucker - "number one difference between a Nobel Prize winner and others is not IQ or work ethic, but that they ask bigger questions."
* Get the entire org to take a small, first step. Do it together so everyone can see the results and start to believe that something great is possible.
* Start with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward greater stretch challenges.
* Bad leaders tell people what to do. Good leaders ask questions and let their people figure out the answers. Great leaders ask questions that focus the intelligence of their team on the right problems.
* The question "why" s at the core of their thinking and takes the form of an insatiable need for deep organizational understanding.
* Engage you team by giving them a "mission impossible", a hard, concrete challenge that wil stretch them and develop new capailities.
* When leaders offer a challenge and create a culture of belief, the organization steps up.
* Invite others to explore the impossible, the uncertain, uncomfortable places that stretch both imagition and capabilities.
* Instead of knowing the answer, use smarts to find opportunities for the org and challenge/stretch the org to get there. Push beyond their own knowledge and that of the organization.
* Assumes that people get smarter and stronger by being challenged.
* By accepting they don't have all the answers, challenger's are free to ask much bigger, more provocative, and, frankly, more interesting questions. They can pursue things they don't know how to do.
* Asks questions that challenge fundamental assumptions and disrupt prevailing logic.
* Analyze problems, but also reframe them to show opportunities presented by challenges.
* Help people see the need that must be met. Make it a learning experience that will reveal need, create energy, and ignite a fire within your org.
* First, extend a clear and concrete challenge. Then ask hard questions that need to be answered, but -most important- don't answer them. Let others fill in the blanks.
* Instead of telling others answers, provide just enough information to provoke thinking and help people discover and see opportunities, share things like the fundamental questions, trends, and assumptions shaping their views.
* Provide a starting point, not a complete solution. Thereby generating more questions than answers, which encourage their team to fully define the opportunity while gaining confidence they are building a solid foundation.
* When others see the need for themselves, they develop a deep understanding, and often all the leader needs to do is get out of their way and let them solve the problem.
* By asking hard questions and inviting others to fill in the blanks, the burden of thinking is shifted to other people. The onus sits with the team to understand the challeng and find a solution.
* Create space between what people know and what they need to know, drawing them into the challenge.
* Make challenges more concrete (tangible/measurable) to allow others to visualize the achievement and communicate confidence that the org has what is required.
* Ask hard questions that challenge people not only to think, but to rethink. Ask such immense questions that people can't answer them based on current knowledge and where they stand. To answer these, the organization must learn.
* Generate the belief that the impossible is actually possible. It isn't enough to see and understand the stretch, people actually need to stretch themselves.
* Accelerate performance because org doesn't have to wait for leader to tell them something or approve.
* Start by developing an overactive and imagination and serious case of curiosity.
* Diminishers:
  * Overly focused on what they know, thereby limiting what the organization can achiev to what they themselves know how to do.
  * Instead of enabling stretching toward future opportunity, give direction in a way that showcases their own knowledge. Instead of seeding opportunity and laying out believable challenge, they tell an dtest.
  * Tend to sell their ideas rather than learning what others know.
  * Ask questions to make a point rather than gain greater insight or generate collective learning.
  * Rather than shifting responsibility, they stay in charge and tell others -in detail- how to do their jobs. They give themselves permission to generate both questions and answers.

## Debate Maker

* Practices of debate maker:
  * Frame the issue:
    * Define the question.
    * Form the team.
    * Assemble the data.
    * Frame the decision.
  * Spark the debate:
    * Create safety for best thinking.
    * Demand rigor.
  * Drive a sound decision:
    * Reclarify the decision-making process
    * Make the decision
    * Communicate the decision and rationale
* Ask for debate with four asks: ask the hard questions, ask for evidence, ask everyone, and ask people to switch.
* Make decisions by first engaging in debate - not only to achieve sound decisions, but also to develop collective intelligence and to ready orgs to execute.
* Focus not on what they know, but on how to know what others know. Operate on an assumption that with enough good minds, we can figure it out.
* Creating debate is easy, creating rigorous debate requires a deliberate approach. Well-crafted frame has four parts:
  * The Question: What is the decision to be made? What are we choosing between?
  * The Why: Why is this an important question to answer? Why does the decision warrant collective input anddeate? What happens if it is not addressed?
  * The Who: Who will be involved in making the decision? Who will give input?
  * The How: How will the final decision be made? Will it be made by majority rule? Consensus? Or will you (or someone else) make the final decision after others provide input and recommendations?
* Framing an issue well lets the team know where to focus. They know what is in and out of bounds.
* A common mistake is to debate a topic rather than a question. The most productive debates answer well-defined questions with clear, often mutually exclusive options.
* Teams often come to the soundest decisions when they come in having an established, clear opening position.
* Great debate is:
  * Engaging: The question is compelling and important to everyone in attendance.
  * Comprehensive: The right information is shared to generate a holistic and collective understanding of the issues at hand.
  * Fact Based: Debate is deeply rooted in fact, not opinion.
  * Educational: People leave the debate more focused on what they learned than on who won or lost.
* Two key elements to great debate: Creating safety and demanding rigor.
* Demand rigor by:
  * Asking questions that challenge conventional thinking.
  * Ask qusetions that unearth assumptions that are holding the organization back.
  * Ask questions that cause the team to think harder and dig deeper.
  * Ask for evidence.
* Pursue all sides of the issue. If agreement is moved toward too quickly, step back and ask for the other point of view to be argued.
* After asking people to come prepared with an opening position, consider having them drop this and argue the opposite.
* May relish debate, but only in pursuit of a sound decision. Ensure this by:
  * Reclarifying the decision-making process.
  * Make the decision or explicitly delegate it to someone to decide.
  * Communicate the decision and the rationale.
* Answer questions such as:
  * Are we making the decision right now, or do we need more information?
  * Is this a team decision, or will the leader make the final call? If it is a team decision, how will we resolve any differing views?
  * Has anything that has surfaced in the debate altered the decision-making process?
* Generate and leverage collective thinking. May seek full consensus, but equally comfortable making the final decision.
* As people watch debate, they come to a better understandinfg of the issue. When decisions are reached, people at all levels are ready to execute. Makes communicating decisions and rationale easier because org is already prepared to move forward.
* Rules of shared inquiry:
  * Discussion leader only asks questions.
  * Students must supply evidence to support their theories.
  * Everyone participates.
  * (optionally) Ask people to switch positions.
* Let people weigh in, and they will give you buy-in.
* Diminishers:
  * Bring issues/decisions to others' attention, but don't frame it in a way that allows others to contribute. Focus on what of decision, rather than how or why.
  * Tend to dominate discussion/debate with their own ideas.
  * Rather than driving sound decisions, tend to force decisions either by relying heavily on their own opinion or by shortcutting rigorous debate.
  * At first glance, may appear to be making efficient decisions, however it leaves the broader organization in the dark (not understanding assumptions/facts). Lacking clarity, people turn to debating the soundness of a decision rather than executing it.

## Investor

* "A leader is someone who helps others lead"
* Teach and Coach.
* Offer suggestions, ask questions and highlight/escalate critical issues, but always return accountaility. Use statements like: "I'm happy to help think this through, but I'm looking to you to lead this.", "You are still lead on this", or "I'm here to back you up; What do you need from me as you lead this?"
* "You're smart. You figure it out." Validate ideas and give back onus for solving to them.
* Returning ownership creates self-sufficiency, avoiding dependent organizations.
* Give 51 perent of the vote and full ownership to create certainty and build confidence. Replaces second guessing with getting second opinions.
* When only given ownership of a piece, people tend to overfit to their portion. With ownership of the whole they stretch their thinking and scope.
* By stretching a role you create a vacuum that much be filled and stretch the person in it.
* After establishing ownership, protect your investment by infusing the knowledge and resources needed to deliver
* Provide backup, ensure a safety net is in place, a planned backup that can be gone to for advice on how to recover gracefully.
* Expect Complete Work. Offer solutions, not just problems. Never do anything for other people that they can do for themselves.
* Ask for the F-I-X - ask for the complete thought process and a fix. Use simple questions like: What solution(s) do you see to this problem? How would you propose we solve this? What would you like to do to fix this?
* Respect Natural Consequences. When we protect people from the ramifications of their actions, we stunt their learning. Real intelligence gets developed through experimentation and by trial and error. Also allow people to experience the full force of their success.
* Manage the work, not do the work.
* Diminishers tell you what they know; multipliers help you learn what you need to know.
* Diminishers:
  * Maintain Ownership - dole out piecemeal tasks, but not real responsiility.
  * Jump In and Out
  * Take it Back - hand over work, but take it back the moment problems arise.

## Accidental Diminisher

* Types of Accidental Diminishers:
  * Idea Guy - Believe tossing around more ideas will spark more ideas of others. But new ideas all the time can be exhausting, and and others chase these ideas they will stop coming up with their own.
  * Always On - Assuming energy is contagiuous, but enervates rather than energizing. Can supress introverts while allowing action-oriented extroverts to dominate. If the leader is always on, everyone else is always off.
  * Rescuer - When managers help too soon and too often, others become dependent and helpless. Sometimes we are most helpful when we don't help.
  * Pacesetter - The faster we run, the slower others walk. When leaders set the pace, they are more likely to create spectators than followers.
  * Rapid Responder - Tend to generate low-grade apathy instead of agility, as others will respond slower if someone is already "on it". Not only will the leader end up being the only responder, but they will be the only one growing as well.
  * Optimist - If the leader sees only upside, others can become preoccupied with downside. Sometimes others want acknowledgement of challenge and recognition of struggle.
  * Protector - If people are always protected from danger, they never learn to fend for themselves.
  * Strategist - People spend time second-guessing rather than finding their own answers. If you have a reputation for big thinking, don't be surprised if others save the big thinking for you.
  * Perfectionist - May see an A+ in progress, but others see nothing but red marks and blue tape all over.
* Self-awareness as a leader comes from understanding the perspectives of those we lead and serve, the "customers" of our leadeship. Learning can start with insight, but can't end there.
* Leading with intention starts with understanding how natural tendencies can take us down the wrong path. Great habits and seemingly strong traits can go awry and become vulnerabilities.
* Holding back doesn't express indifference, but rather a vote of confidence.
* Questions to elicit feedback:
  * How might I be shutting down the ideas and action of others, despite having the best of intentions?
  * What am I inadvertently doing that might be having a diminishing impact on others?
  * How might my intentions be interpreted diferently by others? What messages might my actions actually be conveying?
  * What could I do differently?
* Even the best leaders have blind spots. After identifying yours, work with your team to develop a set of signals and workarounds.
* Although leaders may view their leadership through the lens of positive intentions, staff perceive the same behaviour only by its negative consequences.
* Do less and challenge more. Becoming a multiplier often starts with becoming less of a diminisher. This often means doing less: less talking, less responding, less convincing, and less rescuing of others who need to struggle and learn for themselves.

## Dealing with Diminishers

* Don't wait for perfect behavior, celebrate anything in the right direction.
* Be wary of doubling down when threatened or when your ideas are not heard.
* The best way out of diminishing is to lead like a multiplier yourself.
* Instead of responding with criticism and avoidance, respond with intellectual curiosity.
* Strategies:
  * It's not necessarilly about you.
  * Diminishing isn't inevitable.
  * You can lead your leader.
* Level 1: Defenses Against the Dark Arts of Diminishing Managers
  * Turn Down the Volume - It's easy to assume our contribution isn't being valued; however, in reality, they probably just value their own contribution more.
  * Strengthen Other Connections
  * Retreat and Regroup - Instead of attempting to win, just stay in the game.
  * Send the Rigth Signals - Primary cause of micromanaging is a concern that something won't get completed fully or correctly.
  * Assert Your Capaility - Sometimes you just need to tell someone that you don't need help.
  * Ask for Performance Intel - When things get prescriptive, ask to back up and get more context and direction.
    * What is the target, and why is it important?
    * Am I actually hitting the target?
  * Shop for a New Boss - Note, if you keep being surrounded by diminishers, it may partly be you.
* Level 2: Multiplying Up
  * Exploit Your Boss's Strengths
  * Give Them a User's Guide - Broadcast your capabilities to help colleagues understand, or simply tell them what you are good at and how you can best be used. Give your genious a name and outline specific ways it can be put to work. If you want to work at your highest point of contribution, you need to let people know your value.
  * Listen to Learn - Instead of going into battle, look for common ground.
  * Admit Your Mistakes - Set the tone by admitting mistakes, sharing learning, and letting the boss know you are smarter each time.
  * Sign Up for a Stretch - Send signals that you are ready to tackle a challenge that is a size too big.
  * Invite Them to the Party - When blocked, diminishers work even more aggressively to insert themselves. Transparency signals that all is well and you have nothing to hide. By initiating you maintain more control over how the boss contributes/engages, minimizing bungee-boss dynamics.
* Level 3: Inspiring Multiplier Leadership in Others
  * Assume Positive Intent
  * Address One Issue at a Time - If we unload all our frustrations, diminishers may feel attacked and retreat to what they know best, shutting down ideas that are not their own.
  * Celebrate Progress - Give yourself permission to be better than your boss, and watch the organization take notice.
* You can break the spiral by better asserting your capabilities or becoming the leader you wish you had.

## Becoming a Multiplier

* Near universal three-step reaction to Multipliers: Resonance, realization of accidental diminishing, and resolve to be a multiplier.
* Accelerators:
  * Start with the Assumptions
  * Work the Extremes - Zenger-Folkman study demonstrates leaders don't need to be good at everything. They need mastery of a small number of skills and a lack of showstopping weaknesses. Focus on the extremes of neutralizing weaknesses and topping off strengths.
  * Run an Experiment
  * Brace Yourself for Setbacks - Be kind to yourself as you continue to make mistakes and share your strategy with colleagues who are likely to encourage you along the way.
  * Ask a Colleague - Let a colleague choose your experiment for you. ie If I want to bring out the best in those I lead, which experiment would help me most?
* Encourage and coach self-assessment and adjustment. New beliefs need reinforcement and validation, focus on celebrating and sharing progress.
* Successful implementations typically start in the middle. When execs notice positive outcomes they are quick to join. Start small and build a series of wins.
* Strong cultures have these traits:
  * Common language - Words and phrases that hold common meaning within a community based on opinions, principles and values.
  * Learned behaviors - A set of learned responses to stimuli.
  * Shared beliefs - The accetpance of something as true.
  * Heroes and legends - People who are admired or idealized for their qualities, behavior, and/or achievements and the stories told about their heroic actions.
  * Rituals and norms - Consistent behavior regularly followed by an individual or a group.
* When new ideas become new norms, you have cultivated a sustainable culture.
* Building Deep Culture:
  * Common Language
    * Hold a book talk.
    * Discuss accidental diminishers.
  * Learned Behavior
    * Introduce Multiplier mindsets.
    * Teach Multiplier skills.
    * Fuse Multipliers with daily decisions.
  * Shared Beliefs - Peaks and perimeters are defined. People know what earns hero status and what gets kicked out. Core beliefs aout leadership should be defined and validated more frequently than violated.
    * Codify a leadership ethos.
    * Spotlight Multiplier moments - don't need to wait for an award, spotlight efforts along the way.
    * Measure managers.
  * Rituals and Norms
    * Pilot a Multiplier practice.
    * Integrate practices with business metrics.
* Draw on the power of community to spark and sustain momentum, especially when you encounter setbacks.

# Multipliers, Revised and Updated: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter by Liz Wiseman
- The reason for the difference is that when people work with Multipliers, they hold nothing back. They offer the very best of their thinking, creativity, and ideas. They give more than their jobs require and volunteer their discretionary effort, energy, and resourcefulness. They actively search for more valuable ways to contribute. They hold themselves to the highest standards. They give 100 percent of their abilities to the work—and then some. (360)
- Our research confirmed that Multipliers not only access people’s current capability, they stretch it. They get more from people than they knew they had to give. People reported actually getting smarter around Multipliers. (368)
- “The resource allocation task of top management has received too much attention when compared to the task of resource leverage. . . . If top management devotes more effort to assessing the strategic feasibility of projects in its allocation role than it does to the task of multiplying resource effectiveness, its value-added will be modest indeed.” (407)
- Instead of achieving linear growth by adding new resources, leaders rooted in the logic of multiplication believe that you can more efficiently extract the capability of your people and watch growth skyrocket by multiplying the power of the resources you have. (433)
- Multipliers don’t get more with less; they get more by using more. (449)
- The Diminisher’s view of intelligence is based on elitism and scarcity. Diminishers appear to believe that really intelligent people are a rare breed and that they are of that rare breed. From this assumption they conclude that they are so special, other people will never figure things out without them. (458)
- In addition to seeing intelligence as a scarce commodity, our research showed that Diminishers regard intelligence as something basic about a person that can’t change much; they believe it is static, not able to change over time or circumstance. (472)
- In addition, Multipliers see intelligence as continually developing. (485)
- They think like one manager we interviewed who takes stock of her team members by asking herself, “In what way is this person smart?” In answering this question, she finds colorful capabilities often hidden just below the surface. Instead of writing people off as not worth her time, she is able to ask, “What could be done to develop and grow these capabilities?” She then finds an assignment that both stretches the individual and furthers the interests of the organization. (490)
- Multipliers look at the complex opportunities and challenges swirling around them and think, There are smart people everywhere who will figure this out and get even smarter in the process. And they see that their job is to bring the right people together in an environment that liberates everyone’s best thinking—and then to get out of their way and let them do it! (493)
- The Diminisher is an Empire Builder who acquires resources and then wastes them. The Multiplier is a Talent Magnet who utilizes and increases everyone’s genius. (517)
- The Diminisher is a Tyrant who creates a stressful environment. The Multiplier is a Liberator who creates a safe environment that fosters bold thinking. (526)
- The Diminisher is a Know-It-All who gives directives. The Multiplier is a Challenger who defines opportunities. (532)
- Diminishers are Decision Makers who try to sell their decisions to others. Multipliers are Debate Makers who generate real buy-in. (540)
- The Diminisher is a Micromanager who jumps in and out. The Multiplier is an Investor who gives others ownership and full accountability. (547)
- They expect great things from their people and drive them to achieve extraordinary results. They are beyond results-driven; they are tough and exacting. Indeed, Multipliers make people feel smart and capable, but they don’t do it by being “feel-good” managers. They look into people and find capability, and they want to access all of it and utilize people to their fullest. They see a lot, so they expect a lot. (556)
- It’s not that these Multipliers shrink so that others can be big. It’s that they play in a way that invites others to play big, too. (578)
- Multipliers aren’t necessarily comedians, but they don’t take themselves or situations too seriously. (581)
- Perhaps one of our biggest surprises was realizing how few Diminishers understood the restrictive impact they were having on others. (590)
- Empire Builders seek to surround themselves with A players. But, unlike Talent Magnets, they accumulate talent to appear smarter and more powerful. (767)
- Empire Builders hoard resources and underutilize talent. Talent Magnets attract talented people and use them at their highest point of contribution. (779)
- A Talent Magnet knows that genius comes in many forms. (826)
- In their quest to assemble the finest talent, Talent Magnets are blind to organizational boundaries. They see multiple forms of intelligence everywhere. Talent Magnets live in a world without walls and without hierarchical or lateral restrictions. Instead, they see talent networks. (839)
- The idea is simple. Multipliers understand that people love to contribute their genius. If they put in the effort to figure out someone’s genius, they have opened a pathway for that person to contribute. (846)
- Talent Magnets know how to uncover and access the native genius of others. (872)
- A native genius or talent is something that people do, not only exceptionally well, but absolutely naturally. They do it easily (without extra effort) and freely (without condition). (873)
- By telling people what you see, you can raise their awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capability more fully. (889)
- Once a Talent Magnet has uncovered the native genius of others, he or she looks for opportunities that demand that capability. (900)
- Once they’ve engaged the person’s true genius, they shine a spotlight on them so other people can see their genius in action. (901)
- But Talent Magnets go beyond just giving people resources. They remove impediments, which quite often means removing people who are blocking and impeding the growth of others. (955)
- “Ignore me as needed to get your job done.” This simple mantra signaled an important trust in the judgment and capability of others. (999)
- Empire Builders ensure that they, themselves, are the point of integration. You can often spot an Empire Builder because he or she either operates exclusively through one-on-one meetings or runs staff meetings as an official report-out from each fiefdom. (1024)
- “developing the talent of the team” was among the lowest three skills of the Diminisher. (1035)
- Instead of asking, “Is this person smart?” try asking, “In what way is this person smart?” (1059)
- Try supersizing someone’s job. Assess their current capabilities and then give them a challenge that is a size too big. (1066)
- While most managers try to retain their top players, the best leaders know when it’s time to let them go. They recognize when a superstar has outgrown his or her environment. (1070)
- Robert operates as a peer to everyone he works with and is accessible to all. One of his managers said of him, “He is very good at disarming you. He is a commoner—one of us. Even if you work three levels below him, he still wants to know what you think.” As a result, people are more transparent around him. They don’t feel like they have to tell him what he wants to hear. (1185)
- “During a crisis, he asks even more questions—the same type of questions that force you to really think through a situation—just more of them. You feel his stealthy hand guiding decisions.” (1208)
- Tyrants create a tense environment that is full of stress and anxiety. Liberators like Robert, on the other hand, create an intense environment that requires concentration, diligence, and energy. It is an environment where people are encouraged to think for themselves and also where people experience a deep obligation to do their best work. (1216)
- The Liberator creates an environment where good things happen. They create the conditions where intelligence is engaged, grown, and transformed into concrete successes. (1226)
- “He lets us know that when decisions are collective, the mistakes are collective, too. No one person takes the blame.” The team then does a postmortem and learns how to avoid the error a second time. (1242)
- They create both comfort and pressure in the environment. In the eyes of the Liberator, it is a just exchange: I give you space; you give me back your best work. (1291)
- Liberators also give people space to make mistakes. They create an environment of learning, but they expect people to learn from the mistakes. Another fair trade: I give you permission to make mistakes; you have an obligation to learn from the mistakes and not repeat them. (1293)
- Such leaders create an open, comfortable environment where people can freely think and contribute, and when more power is needed, they invoke their demanding side which commands only the best performance from others. (1299)
- It is a small victory to create space for others to contribute. It is a huge victory to maintain that space and resist the temptation to jump back in and consume it yourself. (1309)
- Liberators are more than just good listeners; they are ferocious listeners. They listen to feed their hunger for knowledge, to learn what other people know and add it to their own reservoir of knowledge. (1323)
- With John’s encouragement, his team and I decided to define a space for experimentation. We rapidly laid out their various work scenarios into two buckets: in one, failure was okay; in the other, success had to be assured. (1341)
- “risk and iterate” performance goal that encouraged each design operations director to identify something they would take a risk with and then iterate solutions throughout the year. (1346)
- Liberators know how to amplify these voices to extract maximum intelligence and give advantage to the ideas and voices on the lower end of the playing field. (1357)
- “Wisdom doesn’t just come from the top; it comes from all across the organization. But, as a leader, you have to do more than just not discourage it, you need to actively encourage people to speak up. The leader has to ask questions and invite the most junior people to express their ideas.” (1365)
- As a manager you know when someone is below his or her usual performance. What is harder to know is whether people are giving everything they have. Asking whether people are offering their best gives them the opportunity to push themselves beyond previous limits. (1400)
- Requiring people’s best work is different from insisting on desired outcomes. (1404)
- “If you want your organization to take risks, you have to separate the experiment from the outcome. I have zero tolerance if someone does not run the experiment. But I don’t hold them accountable for the outcome of the experiment. I only hold them accountable to execute.” (1407)
- Liberators give people permission to make mistakes and the obligation to learn from them. (1416)
- By taking his mistakes public, he made it safe for others to take risks and fail. (1427)
- it’s okay to fail. You just can’t make the same mistake twice.” (1431)
- Liberators get the best thinking from people by creating a rapid cycle between thinking, learning, and making and recovering from mistakes in order to generate the best ideas and create an agile organization. (1443)
- There is an assumption that underlies the practices of a Liberator: People’s best thinking must be given, not taken. (1489)
- Instead of demanding the best work directly, they create an environment where it not only can be offered, but where it is deeply needed. Because the environment naturally requires it, a person freely bestows their best thinking and work. (1492)
- I gave him five poker chips, each worth a number of seconds of talk time. One was worth 120 seconds, the next three worth 90 seconds, and one was worth just 30. I suggested he limit his contribution in the meeting to five comments, represented by each of the chips. He could spend them whenever he wished, but he only had five. (1503)
- Try giving yourself a budget of poker chips for a meeting. Maybe it is five; maybe it is just one or two. Use them wisely, and leave the rest of the space for others to contribute. (1510)
- As he unraveled the mess, he learned to carefully label the difference between a random musing, an opinion, and a policy decision. (1515)
- Try the practice used by Michael Chang, in his shift to Liberator. Divide your views into “soft opinions” and “hard opinions”:   Soft opinions: you have a perspective to offer and ideas for someone else to consider   Hard opinions: you have a clear and potentially emphatic point of view (1516)
- There is no easier way to invite experimentation and learning than to share stories about your own mistakes. (1522)
- When we help people see a path to recovery, we spawn a learning cycle. (1526)
- Let people know about mistakes you have made and what you have learned from them. (1528)
- Instead of talking about mistakes behind closed doors or just one-on-one, bring them out in the open where the person making a mistake can clear the air and where everyone can learn. Try making it part of your management ritual. (1531)
- Define the space for experimentation in your team’s work by clarifying the area where it’s okay to fail versus when failure isn’t an option. (1537)
- The number one difference between a Nobel Prize winner and others is not IQ or work ethic, but that they ask bigger questions. PETER DRUCKER (1578)
- Matt got more out of people than they knew they had to give—not because he convinced them that a goal was possible, but because he invited them to explore the impossible, that uncertain, uncomfortable place that makes us stretch both our imagination and our capabilities. (1609)
- In the end, Diminishers place an artificial limit on what their organizations can accomplish. Because they are overly focused on what they know, they limit what their organization can achieve to what they themselves know how to do. (1655)
- Instead of knowing the answer, they play the role of the Challenger. They use their smarts to find the right opportunities for their organizations and challenge and stretch their organizations to get there. They aren’t limited by what they themselves know. They push their teams beyond their own knowledge and that of the organization. (1658)
- His assumption seems to be that people get smarter and stronger by being challenged. (1679)
- Once a leader accepts that he or she doesn’t have to have all the answers, he or she is free to ask much bigger, more provocative, and, frankly, more interesting questions. They can pursue things they don’t know how to do. (1682)
- Ray and the executive team had started out trying to tell others all the answers. Now they switched to sharing the fundamental questions, trends, and assumptions that were shaping their views. (1699)
- Multipliers don’t give answers. Instead they begin a process of discovery: they provide just enough information to provoke thinking and to help people discover and see the opportunity for themselves. (1729)
- One of the best ways to seed an opportunity is to allow someone else to discover it themselves. When people can see the need for themselves, they develop a deep understanding of the issues, and quite often, all the leader needs to do is get out of their way and let them solve the problem. (1732)
- Multipliers ask the questions that challenge the fundamental assumptions in an organization and disrupt the prevailing logic. (1746)
- Multipliers understand the power of an opportunity. As Peter Block, consulting guru and author, observed, “the most powerful work is done in response to an opportunity not in response to a problem.” Multipliers analyze problems, but they also reframe them to show the opportunity presented by the challenges. (1758)
- Multipliers provide a starting point but not a complete solution. In this way, they generate more questions than answers. These questions then encourage their team to fully define the opportunity while giving them confidence that they are building on a solid foundation. (1778)
- that it creates a huge stretch for an organization. While Diminishers create a huge gap between what they know and what other people know, Multipliers create a space between what people know and what they need to know, and that draws people into the challenge. (1787)
- First, they extend a clear and concrete challenge. Then they ask the hard questions that need to be answered to achieve the challenge, but—most important—they don’t answer them. They let others fill in the blanks. (1792)
- college-bound challenge, our research showed that Multipliers use their intelligence to make challenges concrete for others. These challenges become tangible and measurable, allowing people to assess their performance. By making a challenge real, they allow others to visualize the achievement and communicate the confidence that the organization has the collective brainpower required. (1823)
- Multipliers ask the really hard questions. They ask the questions that challenge people not only to think but to rethink. They ask questions so immense that people can’t answer them based on their current knowledge or where they currently stand. To answer these questions, the organization must learn. (1827)
- Initially, when they establish a concrete challenge, the burden of the thinking sits with them as the leader. By asking the hard questions and inviting others to fill in the blanks, they are shifting the burden of thinking onto their people. The onus now sits with their team to understand the challenge and find a solution. In this shift, the Multiplier creates intelligence (1836)
- By seeding the opportunity and laying down a challenge, people are interested in what is possible. But this isn’t enough to create movement. Multipliers generate belief—the belief that the impossible is actually possible. It isn’t enough that people see and understand the stretch; they need to actually stretch themselves. (1855)
- One way Multipliers generate belief is by taking the challenge down to the ground level. (1859)
- When people create the plan that they eventually will implement, belief in its viability will be inherently high. (1865)
- Sometimes, the temptation exists for leaders to tackle too many problems all at once. Our research showed that Multipliers begin with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward the greater stretch challenges. (1869)
- Diminishers have a fundamentally different approach to providing direction. Instead of using their intelligence to enable people to stretch toward a future opportunity, they give directions in a way that showcases their superior knowledge. Instead of seeding an opportunity and laying out a believable challenge, Diminishers tell and test. (1894)
- Diminishers consider themselves thought leaders and readily share their knowledge; however, they rarely share it in a way that invites contribution. They tend to sell their ideas rather than learning what others know. (1898)
- When Diminishers do actually engage others, it’s no surprise that they want to verify that you understand what they know. They ask questions to make a point rather than to access greater insight or to generate collective learning. (1904)
- Rather than shift responsibility to other people, Diminishers stay in charge and tell others—in detail—how to do their jobs. They assume the senior thinker posture, giving themselves permission to generate both the questions and the answers. (1908)
- Under the direction of Challengers teams are able to accelerate their performance. Because the organization does not have to wait for the leader to think of it first, they can solve tougher problems at an accelerated rate. Because people understand the context, they can act for themselves rather than wait to be told or approved. (1935)
- Challengers start with developing their overactive imagination and a serious case of curiosity. (1943)
- The question “why” is at the core of their thinking and takes the form of an insatiable need for deep organizational understanding. (1946)
- A bad leader will tell people what to do. A good leader will ask questions and let his or her people figure out the answers. A great leader asks the questions that focus the intelligence of their team on the right problems. (1953)
- Engage your team by giving them a “mission impossible,” a hard, concrete challenge that will stretch them and develop new capabilities. (1984)
- When leaders offer a challenge and then create a culture of belief, the organization steps up. (1987)
- Help people see the need that must be met. Make it a learning experience that will reveal that need, create energy, and ignite a fire within your organization. (1998)
- Get the entire organization to take a small, first step. But do it together so everyone can see the results and start to believe that something great is possible. (2003)
- Multipliers make decisions by first engaging people in debate—not only to achieve sound decisions but also to develop collective intelligence and to ready their organizations to execute. (2051)
- Multipliers hold a very different view. They don’t focus on what they know but on how to know what others know. They operate on the assumption that with enough good minds on it, we can figure it out. (2094)
- creating a debate is easy, creating a rigorous debate requires a deliberate approach. (2182)
- In framing an issue, there are four parts to a well-crafted frame:   THE QUESTION: What is the decision to be made? What are we choosing between?   THE WHY: Why is this an important question to answer? Why does the decision warrant collective input and debate? What happens if it is not addressed?   THE WHO: Who will be involved in making the decision? Who will give input?   THE HOW: How will the final decision be made? Will it be made by majority rule? Consensus? Or will you (or someone else) make the final decision after others provide input and recommendations? (2189)
- A common mistake is attempting to debate a topic rather than a question. The most productive debates are in answer to a well-defined question, one with clear, often mutually exclusive options. (2206)
- Interestingly enough, we find that teams come to the soundest decisions when people come in having established a clear opening position, rather than starting from a neutral position. (2212)
- When a leader has framed the issues well, the rest of the team knows where to focus. They know what’s in bounds, and they know what is out of bounds. (2217)
- A great debate is:   ENGAGING: The question is compelling and important to everyone in attendance.   COMPREHENSIVE: The right information is shared to generate a holistic and collective understanding of the issues at hand.   FACT BASED: The debate is deeply rooted in fact, not opinion.   EDUCATIONAL: People leave the debate more focused on what they learned than on who won or lost. (2235)
- There are two key elements that couple and form the yin and the yang of great debate. The first is to create safety. The second is to demand rigor. (2241)
- How do Multipliers demand rigor? They ask the questions that challenge conventional thinking. They ask the questions that unearth the assumptions that are holding the organization back. They ask the questions that cause the team to think harder and to dig deeper. They ask for evidence. (2253)
- Debate Makers pursue all sides of the issue. When the group moves too quickly toward agreement, Multipliers often step back and ask someone to argue the other point of view. (2289)
- Next came “the switch.” After asking people to come prepared with an opening position, he asked them to drop their position and argue from the exact opposite point of view. (2292)
- Multipliers may relish a great debate, but they pursue debate with a clear end: a sound decision. They ensure this in three ways. First, they reclarify the decision-making process. Second, they make the decision or explicitly delegate it to someone else to decide. And third, they communicate the decision and the rationale behind it. (2314)
- They address such questions as:   Are we making the decision right now or do we need more information?   Is this a team decision or will the leader make the final call?   If it is a team decision, how will we resolve any differing views?   Has anything that has surfaced in the debate altered the decision-making process? (2319)
- Although Multipliers know how to generate and leverage collective thinking, they are not necessarily consensus-oriented leaders. At times, they may seek the full consensus of the group; however, our research shows that they are equally comfortable making the final decision. (2329)
- As people watched these debates, they came to a better understanding of the issues. When decisions were reached, there were people at all levels of the organization ready to execute. With this model of transparent decision making, communicating the decision and the rationale is easy because the organization is already prepared to move forward. (2340)
- When a problem surfaces, Diminishers bring issues or decisions to people’s attention, but they don’t necessarily frame them in a way that allows others to easily contribute. When they raise the issue, they focus on the “what” rather than on the “how” or the “why” of a decision. (2356)
- When issues get discussed or debated, Diminishers tend to dominate the discussion with their own ideas. (2360)
- Rather than driving a sound decision, Diminishers tend to force a decision, either by relying heavily on their own opinion or by shortcutting rigorous debate. (2364)
- What is the impact to the organization of the Diminisher’s approach to decision making? At first glance, it appears that Diminishers make efficient decisions. However, because their approach only utilizes the intelligence of a small number of people and ignores the rigor of debate, the broader organization is left in the dark, not understanding the decision or the assumptions and facts upon which it is based. Lacking clarity, people turn to debating the soundness of a decision—“spinning” it rather than executing it. (2368)
- There are three rules in shared inquiry: (2389)
- THE DISCUSSION LEADER only asks questions. (2390)
- THE STUDENTS must supply evidence to support their theories. (2392)
- EVERYONE participates. (2394)
- To drive further rigor into the conversation, you might try a fourth ask: 4.  ASK PEOPLE TO SWITCH POSITIONS. (2414)
- Let people weigh in, and they will give you their buy-in. (2431)
- DEBATE MAKERS engage people in debating the issues up front, which leads to sound decisions that people understand and can execute efficiently. (2436)
- The Three Practices of the Debate Maker 1.  Frame the Issue •  Define the question •  Form the team •  Assemble the data •  Frame the decision 2.  Spark the Debate •  Create safety for best thinking •  Demand rigor 3. Drive a Sound Decision •  Reclarify the decision-making process •  Make the decision •  Communicate the decision and rationale (2437)
- Becoming a Debate Maker Make a debate with four asks: 1) Ask the hard question, 2) ask for evidence, 3) ask everyone, 4) ask people to switch. (2446)
- Multipliers invest in the success of others. They may jump in to teach and share their ideas, but they always return to accountability. (2482)
- When leaders fail to return ownership, they create dependent organizations. (2483)
- Multipliers enable others to operate independently by giving other people ownership of results and investing in their success. Multipliers can’t always be present to perform emergency rescues, so they ensure that people on their teams are self-sufficient and can operate without their direct presence. (2486)
- Multipliers operate as Investors. They invest by infusing others with the resources and ownership they need to produce results independent of the leader. It isn’t just benevolence. They invest, and they expect results. (2493)
- What perhaps isn’t so obvious is why, when the stakes are high, many managers in organizations don’t hesitate to run onto the playing field, steal away the ball, and score the winning goal. (2533)
- Her approach to management is the outgrowth of her simple motto: “A leader is someone who helps others lead.” (2573)
- 1. Defining Ownership Investors begin this cycle by establishing ownership up front. They see intelligence and capability in the people around them, and they put them in charge. (2600)
- Giving someone 51 percent of the vote and full ownership creates certainty and builds confidence. It enables them to stop second-guessing and start getting second opinions. (2610)
- Give Ownership for the End Goal (2614)
- When people are given ownership for only a piece of something larger, they tend to optimize that portion, limiting their thinking to this immediate domain. When people are given ownership for the whole, they stretch their thinking and challenge themselves to go beyond their scope. (2627)
- Stretch the Role (2630)
- We consistently find that Multipliers get twice the capability from their people that Diminishers do. And time after time, people tell us that Multipliers got not only 100 percent of their skills and know-how but 120 percent, or even more. Multipliers do get more than 100 percent because people grow under the watch of a Multiplier. One way that Multipliers incite this growth is by asking people to stretch and do something they’ve never done before. (2630)
- When Investors stretch the role, they stretch the person in it. This bigger role creates a vacuum that must be filled. (2659)
- 2. Investing Resources (2660)
- The moment Investors establish an ownership position, they step in and begin investing. They protect their investment by infusing the knowledge and resources the person will need to successfully deliver on their accountability. (2660)
- Teach and Coach (2662)
- Diminishers tell you what they know; Multipliers help you learn what you need to know. (2664)
- Provide Backup (2676)
- A wise Multiplier ensures there’s a safety net in place—a planned backup, someone the employee can go to for advice on how to recover gracefully. (2682)
- 3. Holding People Accountable (2687)
- The leader helps, offers suggestions, asks great questions, and may highlight or escalate a critical issue, but the accountability slides back and rests with their staff. (2693)
- Give It Back (2701)
- Investors get involved in other people’s work, but they continually give back leadership and accountability. (2701)
- These words are heard again and again by his team: “You’re smart. You figure it out.” Their ideas are validated and the onus for solving the issue is back with them. (2721)
- Expect Complete Work (2722)
- When we ask for the F-I-X, we give people an opportunity to complete their thinking and their work. We encourage them to stretch and exercise intellectual muscles that might otherwise atrophy in the presence of other smart, capable people. Multipliers never do anything for their people that their people can do for themselves. (2746)
- Respect Natural Consequences (2748)
- Nature teaches best. When we let nature take its course and allow people to experience the natural consequences of their actions, they learn most rapidly and most profoundly. When we protect people from experiencing the natural ramifications of their actions, we stunt their learning. Real intelligence gets developed through experimentation and by trial and error. (2761)
- Multipliers have a core belief that people are smart and will figure things out. (2769)
- The Diminisher’s Approach to Execution (2776)
- The Diminisher operates from a very different assumption: People will never be able to figure it out without me. (2776)
- Let’s look at the ways in which Diminishers cripple the capability of their people and create dependent organizations. (2799)
- MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP. (2800)
- When they delegate, they dole out piecemeal tasks but not real responsibility. (2802)
- JUMP IN AND OUT. Micromanagers hand over work to others, but they take it back the moment problems arise. (2812)
- TAKE IT BACK. (2823)
- As a manager, my job was no longer about me. It was my responsibility to manage the work, not do the work. (2832)
- The Serial Multiplier (2846)
- When leaders like Narayana Murthy invest in the development of other leaders, they earn the right to step away without jeopardizing the performance of the organization. The Investor not only reaps these rewards but is now available to repeat the investment cycle elsewhere. (2869)
- Becoming an Investor (2875)
- 1. GIVE 51 PERCENT OF THE VOTE. (2878)
- 2. LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE. (2884)
- To let nature teach, try these steps: (2888)
- 1.  LET IT HAPPEN. (2888)
- 2.  TALK ABOUT IT. (2890)
- 3.  FOCUS ON NEXT TIME. (2893)
- Not only are there natural consequences to our mistakes, there are natural consequences to good decisions. Allow people to experience the full force of their successes. (2895)
- 3. ASK FOR THE F-I-X. (2897)
- Ask for people to complete the thought process and provide a fix. Use simple questions such as these:   What solution(s) do you see to this problem?   How would you propose we solve this?   What would you like to do to fix this? (2900)
- 4. GIVE IT BACK. (2906)
- Here are some statements that signal that you are handing back the pen:   I’m happy to help think this through, but I’m still looking to you to lead this going forward.   You are still the lead on this.   I’m here to back you up. What do you need from me as you lead this? (2912)
- The immediate Multiplier effect is that Multipliers get, on average, twice the capability from someone they lead. (2923)
- The Accidental Diminisher (2981)
- Idea Guy (2986)
- He simply believes that the more he tosses around his ideas, the more he will spark ideas in others. (2988)
- But as soon as they begin to make progress on yesterday’s idea, the next day brings a new idea du jour. (2990)
- As they learn to stop acting on the leader’s ideas, they also stop trying to come up with their own ideas. After all, if they actually need a new idea, they can just wait for the fountain to spew. (2992)
- Always On (2994)
- They assume that their energy is contagious, like a virus to be caught by anyone in their presence. (2996)
- But, like the common cold, this leader can be draining—she enervates rather than energizes the people around her. (2997)
- And all too often around this leader, thinking introverts are suppressed while action-oriented extroverts dominate. (2999)
- When the leader is always on, everyone else is always off. (3004)
- Rescuer (3005)
- When a manager helps too soon and too often, people around him become dependent and helpless. (3011)
- As leaders, sometimes we are most helpful when we don’t help. (3017)
- Pacesetter (3018)
- He had learned that when he couldn’t keep up, it was best to just let me win. (3037)
- As leaders, sometimes the faster we run, the slower others walk. When leaders set the pace, they are more likely to create spectators than followers. (3038)
- Rapid Responder (3039)
- But instead of agility, the Rapid Responder tends to generate low-grade apathy. Even the best employees are slow to respond when they know that someone else is already “on it.” (3044)
- Not only is the Rapid Responder the first one and the only one to respond, this boss is the only one growing. (3050)
- Optimist (3054)
- He wasn’t opposed to the idea that it was doable; he simply wanted me to acknowledge the challenge and recognize his struggle. He didn’t want me glossing over the challenge with my optimism. (3075)
- When the leader sees only the upside, others can become preoccupied with the downside. (3083)
- Protector (3084)
- In fact, with the assumption that people are smart and will figure it out, a Multiplier is inclined to expose people to such toxins and challenges, hoping that they will build resistance and strength. (3096)
- If the leader continually protects people from danger, they never learn to fend for themselves. (3098)
- Strategist (3099)
- People can spend their time second-guessing what the boss wants rather than finding answers themselves. (3104)
- If you’ve built a reputation as a big thinker, don’t be surprised if people save the big thinking for you. (3106)
- Perfectionist (3107)
- But, while he see an A+ in progress, others see nothing but red marks and blue tape all over their work. (3114)
- This leadership team understood that self-awareness as a leader comes from understanding the perspectives of those we lead and serve, those who are the “customers” of our leadership. Our learning can start with our own insight, but it can’t end there. (3137)
- Here are some questions you might use to elicit this feedback:   How might I be shutting down the ideas and actions of others, despite having the best of intentions?   What am I inadvertently doing that might be having a diminishing impact on others?   How might my intentions be interpreted differently by others? What messages might my actions actually be conveying?   What could I do differently? (3141)
- Leading with intention starts with understanding how our natural tendencies can take us down the wrong path—how great habits and seemingly strong leadership traits can go awry and become our vulnerability. (3152)
- John realized that when he held back, it didn’t express indifference but rather a vote of confidence in his player at bat. (3173)
- Even the best leaders have blind spots. Once you identify yours, you can work with your team to develop a set of signals and workarounds. (3180)
- Do Less and Challenge More (3187)
- Becoming a Multiplier often starts with becoming less of a Diminisher. And this usually means doing less: less talking, less responding, less convincing, and less rescuing of others who need to struggle and learn for themselves. (3187)
- Likewise, while leaders view their own leadership through the lens of their positive intentions, their staff perceives that same behavior only by its negative consequences. (3195)
- He didn’t wait for perfect behavior; he celebrated anything in the right direction, even attempts that were wobbly at first. (3242)
- When bosses sense that their power is being threatened or their ideas not heard, they tend to respond with even greater force, typically doubling down on their point of view. (3288)
- The best way out of a diminishing death spiral is through multiplication—using the logic of multiplication and leading like a Multiplier yourself. (3297)
- What if, instead of responding with criticism and avoidance, you respond with intellectual curiosity, a hallmark of Multiplier leaders? (3299)
- Here we offer strategies to break the cycle of diminishing and mitigate the havoc of less-than-wonderful bosses and toxic colleagues. (3321)
- 1.  IT’S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT YOU. (3323)
- 2.  DIMINISHING ISN’T INEVITABLE. (3327)
- 3.  YOU CAN LEAD YOUR LEADER. (3331)
- The strategies offered below are intended to improve your reactions to Diminishers, relieve stress, neutralize immediate problems, and halt the downward spiral. (3343)
- It will be worth your while to try the strategies on Levels 1 and 2 before going on to Level 3. (3351)
- Level 1: Defenses Against the Dark Arts of Diminishing Managers (3355)
- 1. TURN DOWN THE VOLUME. (3356)
- It’s easy to assume that the Diminisher doesn’t value our contribution; however, in reality, they probably just value their own contribution more. (3361)
- 2. STRENGTHEN OTHER CONNECTIONS. (3377)
- 3. RETREAT AND REGROUP. (3400)
- When facing an impasse, try regrouping and resetting your aspiration—instead of attempting to win, just stay in the game. (3403)
- 4. SEND THE RIGHT SIGNALS. (3410)
- The primary cause of micromanaging (the most prevalent form of diminishing) is concern that something won’t get completed fully or correctly. (3410)
- 5. ASSERT YOUR CAPABILITY. (3425)
- Sometimes you need to tell an overly helpful manager or colleague that you don’t need help. (3432)
- 6. ASK FOR PERFORMANCE INTEL. (3450)
- The first is clear direction—What is the target, and why is it important? (3451)
- When a Diminisher becomes immediately prescriptive, you can ask them to back up and provide more context and direction. (3453)
- The second type of critical information is performance feedback: Am I actually hitting the target? (3460)
- if you want to be on target more often, request feedback at more frequent intervals. (3466)
- 7. SHOP FOR A NEW BOSS. (3467)
- remember that if you are constantly surrounded by Diminishers, at some point you have to ask yourself, “Is it me?” (3483)
- Level 2: Multiplying Up (3487)
- Diminishers want to be valued for their intelligence and ideas; in fact, many are desperate for it. (3492)
- 1. EXPLOIT YOUR BOSS’S STRENGTHS. (3500)
- 2. GIVE THEM A USER’S GUIDE. (3509)
- You can broadcast your capabilities and help your colleagues pick up the signal. Or you can simply tell people what you are good at and how you can be best used. (3511)
- Once you’ve figured out your genius, give it a name, like “troubleshooting,” (or even a superhero name like the Process Surgeon) and then outline a number of ways that your genius can be put to work. (3519)
- If you want to work at your highest point of contribution, you need to let people know your value. (3523)
- 3. LISTEN TO LEARN. (3525)
- Instead of going into battle, look for common ground. (3532)
- 4. ADMIT YOUR MISTAKES. (3551)
- Set the tone by readily admitting your mistakes, sharing your learning, and letting the boss know that you’re smarter each time. (3561)
- 5. SIGN UP FOR A STRETCH. (3563)
- Send signals that you are ready to tackle a challenge that is a size too big. (3567)
- 6. INVITE THEM TO THE PARTY. (3574)
- Diminishers, when blocked, typically work even more aggressively to insert themselves. (3576)
- Your transparency is likely to signal that all is well and that you have nothing to hide. (3582)
- By initiating interaction, you can maintain more control over how the boss contributes, thus minimizing the dreaded bungee-boss dynamic. (3586)
- Level 3: Inspiring Multiplier Leadership in Others (3593)
- 1. ASSUME POSITIVE INTENT. (3600)
- 2. ADDRESS ONE ISSUE AT A TIME. (3606)
- But if we unwisely unload all our frustrations, the Diminisher will only feel attacked and retreat to what they know how to do best—shut down ideas that are not their own. (3606)
- 3. CELEBRATE PROGRESS. (3608)
- Give yourself permission to be better than your boss. And then watch the organization take notice. (3619)
- Supply Your Own Light (3620)
- You can break the downward spiral of diminishing leaders by better asserting your capabilities or by becoming the leader that you wish you had. (3624)
- As various people have heard these ideas and read this book, I have observed a nearly universal three-step reaction: (3715)
- 1. RESONANCE. (3716)
- 2. REALIZATION OF THE ACCIDENTAL DIMINISHER. (3719)
- 3. RESOLVE TO BE A MULTIPLIER. (3722)
- Becoming a Multiplier (3731)
- Accelerator No. 1: Start with the Assumptions (3735)
- Accelerator No. 2: Work the Extremes (3761)
- The Zenger-Folkman study demonstrates that leaders do not need to be good at everything. They need to have mastery of a small number of skills and be free of showstopping weaknesses. (3769)
- As we studied Multipliers, we noticed that each individual Multiplier wasn’t necessarily, or even typically, strong in all five disciplines. The majority of Multipliers were strong in just three. (3771)
- Begin by assessing your leadership practices and then work the two extremes: 1) neutralize a weakness; 2) top off a strength. (3776)
- Accelerator No. 3: Run an Experiment (3792)
- Accelerator No. 4: Brace Yourself for Setbacks (3849)
- First, give yourself permission to stumble as you cultivate new Multiplier behaviors while transforming old habits. (3863)
- Using the following strategy will help you cut yourself some slack until those habits are fully transformed: 1.  My new Multiplier assumption is [people are smart and will figure it out], so I need to develop a new habit [giving space]. 2.  As I’m becoming a Multiplier, old habits will be mixed with new assumptions. 3.  Until those habits are fully uprooted, I will continue making mistakes diminishing others by [jumping in], while I’m trying to learn to multiply others by [giving space]. (3865)
- Second, share your strategy with colleagues who are likely to encourage you along the way. (3870)
- Accelerator No. 5: Ask a Colleague (3874)
- If you really want to accelerate your development as a Multiplier leader, let a colleague—an employee, peer, or boss—choose your experiment for you. (3874)
- ask this question: If I want to bring out the best in the people I lead, which one of the nine experiments would help me the most? (3877)
- Mike began by introducing the language of Multipliers. As a perpetual student of leadership and organization, he understood that changing a culture meant changing the conversation. (3912)
- Mike asked all his managers to read Multipliers and take the Accidental Diminisher quiz (which you can find at www.multipliersquiz.com). (3914)
- But calling out ineffective behavior was just the beginning—they had to define the new leadership behaviors necessary to shape a culture of trust and high performance. (3917)
- Instead of trying to catch and correct all behavioral infractions, they encouraged and coached their teams to self-assess and adjust. (3925)
- New beliefs are initially tenuous and need reinforcement and validation to become inculcated and deeply rooted. Mike and his team created visible programs to celebrate and share progress. (3948)
- Strong cultures typically exhibit the following traits:   Common language: Words and phrases that hold a common meaning within a community based on opinions, principles, and values6   Learned behaviors: A set of learned responses to stimuli7   Shared beliefs: The acceptance of something as true8   Heroes and legends: People who are admired or idealized for their qualities, behavior, and/or achievements and the stories told about their heroic actions9   Rituals and norms: Consistent behavior regularly followed by an individual or a group10 (3968)
- When new ideas become new norms, you have cultivated a sustainable culture. (4017)
- Building Deep Culture (4018)
- Common Language (4034)
- PRACTICE 1: Hold a book talk. (4040)
- PRACTICE 2: Discuss Accidental Diminishers. (4045)
- Learned Behavior (4051)
- PRACTICE 3: Introduce Multiplier mindsets. (4061)
- PRACTICE 4: Teach Multiplier skills. (4086)
- PRACTICE 5: Fuse Multipliers with daily decisions. (4093)
- Shared Beliefs (4100)
- The peaks and perimeters are clearly defined—members know what conduct earns someone hero status and what conduct gets someone kicked out of the tribe. (4101)
- To build a strong culture, define the core beliefs about leadership and ensure those beliefs are validated more frequently than they are violated. (4104)
- PRACTICE 6: Codify a leadership ethos. (4106)
- Heroes And Legends (4112)
- PRACTICE 7: Spotlight Multiplier moments. (4121)
- You don’t need to wait until someone from your company earns an award; you can spotlight leaders inside your company for exemplifying Multiplier leadership. Make heroes out of these genius makers who bring out the best in others. (4126)
- PRACTICE 8: Measure managers. (4128)
- Rituals And Norms (4135)
- PRACTICE 9: Pilot a Multiplier practice. (4138)
- PRACTICE 10: Integrate practices with business metrics. (4147)
- Building Momentum (4158)
- My colleagues and I have noticed that most successful implementations typically start in the middle. (4160)
- When senior executives notice positive outcomes, they are quick to elevate and endorse the new practices, in turn spreading the practices to other parts of the organization. (4163)
- If you don’t yet have the political capital to lead a company-wide initiative, run a pilot with a few rising middle managers. (4166)
- Instead, start small and build a series of successive wins. (4171)
- These series of wins generate the energy and collective will needed to complete the cycle of success. (4172)
- Lastly, you can also draw on the power of community as a way to spark and sustain momentum, especially when you encounter setbacks. (4174)
