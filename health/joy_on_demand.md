## One Mindful Breath

You may close your eyes or keep them open. Take one slow, deep breath. For the duration of that one breath, give your full attention to your breath in a gentle way. Total and gentle attention on fooling your breath, that is all. If you prefer a more specific instruction, bring attention to the feeling in either your nose or your belly as you breathe.

# 3: From One Breath to One Googol - Settling into Sustainable Joy

## Exploring Ways to Settle the Mind

Let us do a short, five-minute sit. We will spend the first three minutes exploring each of the three methods for settling the mind, for one minute each. We will then spend the lat two minutes freestyling, practicing any of the three methods that you most prefer, or any combination of the three.

### Setup

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes opened or closed.

### Anchoring

For one minute, bring gentle attention to the breath, or the body, or any sensory object that affords the mind some measure of attentional stability. If attention wanders away, gently bring it back.

### Resting

For the next minute, rest the mind. If you like, you may imagine the mind resting on the breath the same way a butterfly rests gently on a flower. Or say to yourself, "There is nowhere to go and nothing to do for this one moment, except to rest."

### Being

For the next minute, shift from doing to being. Sitting without agenda. Just sit and experience the present moment, for the duration of one minute.

### Freestyle

For the next two minutes, you may practice any one of the three methods above, whichever your favorite is, or you may switch between them at any time.

## Settling the Mind

Choose one of the three methosd of settling the mind (anchoring, resting, or being) to be your favorite method. Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may open or close your eyes.
Settle your mind using your favorite method for any duration of time. You may switch between methods at any time.

# 4: What, Me Happy? - Inclining the Mind Toward Joy

## Noticing Joy in One Breath

Do the One Mindful Breath exercise from Chapter 2, which is simply to take one deep breath mindfully. If any hint of joy arises anytime during the exercise, simply notice it, that is all. If not hint of joy arises, no problem either; we simply notice the absence of joy.

## Noticing Joy in Daily Life

Whenever there is any exprience of joy, just notice it. That is all.

## Inviting and Attending to Joy

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.
Let us take three breaths. In the first breath, bring gentle but intense attention to the process of breathing. In the second breath, calm the body. In the third breath, bring up joy. If necessary, bring up a smile or half smile, whetever the worsd half smile mean to you. If any joy arises, bring full attention to it. If you like, repeat this three-breaths practice a few more times.

## Attending to the Joy of Blamelessness

When you make an ethical decision or engage in any ethical behavior, take a moment (in the present, or a little later) to think to yourself, "I have done an ethical thing. My conciense is clear. I am happy." If joy arises, bring full attention to that joy for at least one moment.

## Attending to the Joy of Pleasant Daily Experiences

## Awareness of Mortality

## Noticing the Absence of Pain

## Just Note Gone

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.
Sit in meditation for as many minutes as you like. Apply intense attention to the end of every out breath, clearly seeing the moment it ends. At the end of an out breath, if you like, you may silently note to yourself, "Gone."
If any thought or sensation arises, see if you can watch it until it fades away. If it ceases at any time, even if for one moment, note its cessation. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, "Gone."
You may end this meditation at any time. At the moment the meditation ends, take note of it's ending. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, "Gone."

When the next minute begins, start the cycle again, for a total of three minutes.
