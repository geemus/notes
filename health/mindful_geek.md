# The Mindful Geek: Mindfulness Meditation for Secular Skeptics

## Overview

* Mindfulness meditation is paying attention to present-moment sensory experience in a nonjudgemental way. It isn't stopping thinking, emptying your mind, or feeling blissful.

* Focus is a trainable skill, and meditation systematically trains you to concentrate.
* Additional Benefits: Reduce stress, enhance empathy, freedom from automatic reactions, increase cognitivve flexibility, boost memory, reduce pain sensitivity, better brain, and prevent/reverse neurodegeneration
* Meditation can help get us in touch with good life/flourishing PERMA: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishments

* A good starting goal is 30 minutes a day, five days a week, but any amount helps (try for at least 10 minutes per day).
* Common Mistakes: thinking you are doing it wrong, becoming grossly distracted or fantisizing, falling asleep, trying too hard, stopping early, and changing technique within a session.
* Common Tips: Sit with your back upright to signal nervous system to be alert, otherwise don't worry too much about posture, try to be comfortable, and remain still to help your mind settle down.
* Tips for building habits: make a contract with yourself, make a calendar, create social pressure, sit with a group, make it hard to fail, work with a coach, and regularly list the goals and benifits.
* Tips for deeper sensory clarity: think about sensation as 3d instead of just 2d, recognize that sensations aren't always solid or stable, investigate body areas you normally don't, get curious on as fine a scale as you can, notice differences in textures of sensations, notice if sensations are moving or being still, etc.

* Core Concepts: concentration, sensory clarity, and acceptance (CCA)
* Concentration is being able to train your attention on whatever you choose and sustain it there. We develop it by brute force repetition.
* Sensory clarity is having a lot of resolution of details of your focus object. We develop it by trying to make ever finer distinctions.
* Acceptance is having an open, curious, non-judgemental attitude to whatever is happening. We develop it by just doing it.
* Acceptance is experienced in the body as physical relaxation and/or in the mind as lack of psychological resistance. Take advantage of this by alternating if one or the other is a struggle.
* A good meditation can result from having even a little of one of CCA, if you have two or three it will be quite good.

* Evolution has guided our nervous system to use pleasure and pain as guidance systems, but our context has changed and these signals may not always be as valuable.
* Benefits: it is hard to investigate things you are avoiding/suppressing/denying and these signals are just as behaviorally valuable as pleasurable ones, you can miss insights by avoiding this investigation, trying to avoid pain signals can make them feel worse.
* Our ability to imagine the future is a defining characteristic, but also leads to a state of constant stress which activates the hypothalamic-pituitarity-adrenal (HPA) system. Meditation can provide a counter by helping us to relax and giving us something to focus on other than future worries.

* Emotions rule our lives, mindfulness can give us more insight and clarity. We need both positive and negative signals to motivate and direct us. Mindfulness brings unconcious or semi-concious emotional experience into focus and awareness, improving emotional intelligence.
* Basic emotions: fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and joy.
* Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH) - Emotions may be orchestrated deep in the unconcious mind, but they are mainly embodied events
* If emotions are feeling overwhelming you can: focus on a neutral spot in the body, focus on something external, or pendulate (alternate between something neutral and the hotspot).

* Flow comes from tasks you like and can do, but that remains challenging. Training focus increases flow by reducing boredom when something is too easy or anxiety when something is too hard. We can practice this by choosing focus objects which are a bit too hard or boring for us.

* We can increase concentration in our lives by removing distractions.

* Mindful listening can deepen our engagement and the quality of our interactions.

* We tend to move through life relying on heuristics. Mindfulness allows us to bypass this and rediscover the details by building our sensory clarity. Getting into smaller and subtler dimensions of sensation is a powerful way to improve sensory clarity and continue progressing in meditation practice.

* When we are not focused, our thoughts are dominated by the default mode network (DMN), which is roughly the opposite of flow state. Mindfulness can down-regulate DMN through practicing open awareness. Mindfulness meditation can boost creativity by fostering effortlessness.

## Meta-Technique: Labeling

* Labeling helps focus attention and can increase the potency of mindfulness's beneficial effects (particularly when labeling affect)
* Tips: Be gentle/soothing, don't try too hard, you don't have to be right, it's not a mantra, slowly, optional, can be spoken aloud, and can renote or use multiple labels.

## Meta-Technique: General

1. Find a comfortable seat.
2. Sit up straight, extending your spine, and point your chin just slightly (~5 degrees) below horizontal.
3. Relax your entire body, taking three deep breaths, and letting them out slowly.
4. Perform the technique of your choice.
5. Repeat as desired.
6. Spend at least a minute sitting quietly and focusing on relaxed sensations before continuing with your day.

## Meta-Technique: Focus Algorithm

Focus on an object, label it, curiously examine it, accept it, do them all together, and repeat.

1. Notice the focus object
2. Label the focus object
3. Actively explore focus object with great curiosity and depth (make sure to feel at least one very specific sensation somewhere)
4. Feel acceptance toward whatever you find
5. Continue focusing, contacting, and accepting (all at once) for about 5 seconds

## Technique: Focus on Relaxation

Focus on relaxing and the sensations this generates.

* Relax your muscles in sequence, and focus on the sensations of them relaxing.
* Relax your entire body, and focus on the sensation of relaxation.

## Technique: Focus on Body Sensation

Scan for body sensations and curiously examine them.

* Tune into sensations in skin, muscle and bone in sequence throughout your body.
* For each sensation: where is it located, what size is it, what shape is it, what texture is it, etc

* Variation: focus specifically/only on breath sensation.

## Technique: Focus on Emotion

Scan for emotional sensations in the body and curiously examine them.

* For each ...: Feel gross sensations in muscles, skin, and flesh. Then feel subtler sensations. Then either pendulate back and forth, or try to contact both at once.

1. Scan through the body, looking for emotions or labeling none: face, throat, chest, belly, whole body.
2. Scan your whole body for emotional sensations.

## Technique: Focus on Positive

Focus on nice things and the good feelings this generates.

* Loneliness and isolation are damaging to health, and focus on positive seems to counter some of this.
* Enhances wellbeing and helps you feel more positive emotions while building resilience.
* Pitfalls to avoid: Ironic focus on nice things, guilt about positive emotion, and being drawn into a negative quagmire.

1. Think of someone you love. Picture them having the greatest day of their life, see their happiness and joy. At the same time, mentally form a series of positive wishes or statements of intention like "I wish ..." or "I hope ...".
2. Keep seeing and saying these things, periodically checking for positive body sensation. (3-5 minutes)
3. Let go of mental images and mental talk, focus on positive emotional body sensations until they return to neutral.

* Variations: Focus on yourself or focus on someone you are in conflict with.

## Technique: Focus on Now

Focus on the present moment, notice and accept whatever comes.

* When going well it will feel like flow, when going poorly it will be boring.

1. Focus on meta-attention, the thing that tells you what you are presently focusing on.
2. Let your attention notice any aspect of the present moment.
3. If your mind wanders from the present moment, bring it back.
