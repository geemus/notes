# Leading from the Emerging Future: From Ego-System to Eco-System Economies

* Ego-system awareness cares about the well-being of oneself, eco-system awareness cares about the well being of all, including oneself.
* Iceberg model - beneath visible events and crises, are the underlying structures, mental models, and sources that are responsible for creating them. If ignored, we are doomed to repeat these patterns.
* Dealing with symptoms one cluster at a time (siloed) isn't working. On the contrary, it seems to be part of the problem.
* 3 Key Questions
  * In the face of disruption, how do we lead from the emerging future?
    * Two fundamentally different modes of learning: from the past and from the emerging future.
  * What evolutionary economic framework can guide our journey forward?
    * economic framework follows evolution of homan conciousness (they are highly interdependent)
  * What strategies can help us to function as vehicles for shifting the whole?
    * focusing on all 8 acupuncture points
* The source is, from a systems view, where the feedback loop between mind and matters closes in the now, both individually and collectively. We call these "closing-in" points or accupunture points.
* Strategies to help us function as vehicles for the future that wants to emerge:
  * as individuals, groups and organizations, bend attention back to its source to cultivate generative relationships and advance institutional inversion
  * focus on all eight accupuncture points to update economic and societal logic
  * shift global field of entrepreneurship by creating multiregional network of hubs to support building intentional eco-system economies on a scale that meets the challenges of our time
* Journey from Ego-System to Eco-System Awareness
  * Better relating to others.
  * Better relating to the whole system.
  * Better relating to oneself.
* 3 streams/movements beginning to come together now:
  * global civil society, in the tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King
  * action science, as represented by Kurt Lewin and Ed Schein
  * mindfulness and awareness, inherent in all wisdom traditions

## 8 Disconnects

* Disconnects represent decoupling of the structure of societal reality from the structure of economic thought, or decoupling structures of eco-system reality from structures of ego-system awareness.
* Structural disconnects produce systems with delays and broken feedback loops that prevent learning by not allowing decision-makers to experience and personally feel the impact of their decisions. This results in institutions which change too little and too late.
* Shared characteristics of the disconnects:
  * embody structures that are designed not to learn
  * unaware of externalities
  * facilitate money flowing the wrong way (positive externalities up, negative externalities down)
  * allow special-interest groups to rig the system to the disadvantage of the whole
* Unlike increasing GDP, reducing inequality improves welfare of citizens

### Disconnect: Nature

* Connect production, consumption, reuse, and recycling through "earth-to-earth" design.
* Evolution: Mother Nature, Resource, Commodity (land, raw materials), Regulated Commodity, Eco-System and Commons
* Propositions:
  * All economic activity arises from and returns to nature.
  * Commodity fiction - where nature is thought of as a commodity.
  * Biomimicry - Zero Waste, Solar Energy, Diversity and Symbiosis.
  * Closed-Loop Designs
* Solutions: Slow Food, community-supported agriculture (CSA), local food, local living economies, sustainable sourcing, etc.

### Disconnect: Labor

* Connect work (jobs) to Work (passion) through new entrepreneurship infrastructures connecting self and Self.
* Evolution: Self-Sufficiency, Serfdom/Slavery, Labor (commodity), Labor (regulated commodity), Social and Business Entrepreneurship
* Propositions:
  * Discourse of Denial - suggest we are in a cyclical downturn that will be solved as soon as the recession ends, bringing future growth and returning lost industrial jobs
  * Growth Myth - suggest we will solve economic woes through accelerated growth. Disregards: Ecological Limits, Social Limits, and Jobless Growth.
  * Money Myth - suggests that we should work for money, rather than intrinsic rewards.
  * Relinking Work and Entrepreneurship - relink work (jobs) with Work (purpose).
* Solutions: enabling spaces for innovation, key challenges, sensing, capacity-building mechanisms, capital, technology, and community (mentors, partners, and entrepreneurs)

### Disconnect: Capital

* Connect capital with value creation by redirecting speculation into ecological, social, and cultural-creative renewal through gifts and intentional capital.
* Evolution: Natural Capital, Human Capital, Industrial Capital, Financial Capital (externality-blind), Cultural Creative Capital (externality-aware)
* Myths:
  * Financial System is Efficient - focuses too narrowly on short-term profitability, lacks awareness of negative side effects on people and the planet.
  * Money is Capital - individual and collective creativity are the ultimate source of all capital and value creation.
  * Money is a Commodity - seek to relink creation of money with entrepreneurial intention in communities. Redirect profit-seeking speculation to regenerative side of economy: innovation, education, health, sustainability, and the environmental, social, and cultural commons.
  * Money Equals Money - Transfers of money are not just a technical act, they are mirrored as one of: Speculation, Purchase, Loan, or Gift.
    * Gifts may generates highest productivity by empowering the recipient to sense and actualize their emerging future, rather than satisfying funder/stakeholder expectations which tend to be rooted in the past.
* Solutions:
  * New tools to monitor economic/social impact across all four uses of money to increase transparency and awareness.
  * Concept of captial relinking to its source: the collective creativity of all actors in an economic community.
  * Concept of money which makes it's creation transparent and aligned with entrepreneurial intention in a community.
  * Healthier balance among four roles of money through eliminating speculation and strengthening gifts to allow more people to realize their full entrepreneurial potential.

### Disconnect: Technology

* Connect tech creation to societal needs, particularly in underserved markets, through needs assessment and participatory planning.
* Evolution: Indigenous Wisdom, Tools (agricultural revolution), Machines (industrial revolution, coal/steam/railway), System-Centric Automation (2nd industrial revolution, oil/combustion-engine/chemicals), Human-Centric (3rd Industrial revolution, renewables/information-technology)
* Propositions:
  * Liberation Myth - whether technology provides liberation or dependency depends on the quality of awareness we bring.
  * Technology-Fix Myth - despite many failures, a belief that it can magically solve global and local crises maintains.
  * Relink R&D Investment with Pressing Societal Needs
  * Lead the Third Industrial Revolution - we should focus future policy and public investment in whether technology improves or stifles our creativity.
* Solutions:
  * Move from system-centric technologies to human and/or life-centric technologies that we can shape and give meaning to.
  * Create intentional communities of creation (alla Torvald and linux).

### Disconnect: Leadership

* Absence of leadership leads to collectively creating results that nobody wants.
* Connect leadership to the emerging future of the whole through co-sensing, co-inspiring, and co-creating.
* Evolution: Community, Authoritarian (sticks), Incentives (carrots), Participative (norms), Co-creative (collective presence)
* Myths:
  * The Leader is the Person at the Top - to face todays challenges, many, many people in the organization (sometimes everyone) need to be involved.
  * Leadership is About Individuals - leadership is actually a distributed/collective capacity in a system.
  * Leadership is About Creating and Communicating a Vision - focuses too much on broadcasting and not enough on listening.
* Solution: Collective Sensing and Prototyping:
  * Co-initiating - help stakeholders in fragmented systems connect and discover common ground.
  * Co-sensing - help people walk in each other's shoes, see the system from the edges, and develop collective sensing capacity.
  * Co-inspiring - find deeper sources of knowing through deep reflection and intentional moments of stillness
  * Co-creating - exploring the future through hands-on prototyping
  * Co-evolving - scaling and sustaining the new

### Disconnect: Consumption

* Connect economic output to well-being of all through concious/collaborative consuming, and new success indicators like gross national happiness (GNH).
* Evolution: Survival, Traditional (needs-driven), Consumerism (mass consumption), Selectively Concious Consumption, Collaborative Concious Consumption (CCC)
* Myths:
  * Production and Consumption Are Seperate - customer needs don't mark the start of production. Consumers are a target of economic activity, rather than a partner.
  * Consumers Are Seperate From One Another - customers are starting to co-create the economy in a more concious, collection, and intentional way.
  * Material Consumption Creatse Well-Being
* Solutions:
  * Technology - easy access to information levels the playing field.
  * Awareness - more and more consumers desire lifestyles that are healthy, mindful, and sustainable.
  * Disruption - the intensity and frequency of disruption and breakdown are growing.
  * Economic Human Rights - more and more people find it unacceptable to see rich nations failing to reduce the number of people who live in poverty.

### Disconnect: Coordination

* Connect economic parts to the whole through awareness-based collective action (ABC).
* Both the visible hand of central planning and invisible hand of decentralized markets do not require individual decision-makers to consider the well-being of the whole.
* Evolution: Community, Heirarchy/Control, Markets/Competition, Networks/Negotiation, Awareness Based Collective Action (ABC)
* Evolution:
  * Centrally Controlled Economy - (sticks) exterior mechanisms such as targets and plans.
  * Market Economy - (carrots) exterior mechanisms such as price and competition.
  * Social-Market Economy - (norms) exterior/interior mechanisms of negotiation, networks, and dialogue.
  * Co-Creative Eco-System Economy - (ABC) interior mechanisms of common awareness.
* Propositions:
  * Market vs Heirarchies Myth - false dichotomy.
  * Both-And, Not Either-Or - we need both markets and governments.
  * An Economy is Not a Business - economies can not walk away form citizens and it must internalize it's externalities
  * ABC Closes Feedback Loop Between Parts and Whole - build on (heirarchy, markets, negotiation) with capacity of the system to see, sense, and regenerate itself (ABC)

### Disconnect: Ownership

* Connect ownership rights to best use of assets through shared ownership and commons-based property right that safeguard the interests of future generations.
* Property rights are a bundle of legally enforceable rights and responsibilities including: access, use, management, exclusion, and alienation (right to sell).
* Evolution: Communal, State, Private, Mixed (public/private), Commons-Based
* Myths:
  * Only Private Rights Are Efficient - there are counter examples, and private rights have not addressed common resources.
  * Rights Must Be Either Public or Private - false dichotomy, many variations and commons-based options.
* Solution: Commons-Based Property Rights - trusts and trustees accountable to all stakeholders (including future generations).

## Presencing

* What is missing is taking a moment to reflect on what we are doing to ourselves.
* Gist of framework: The quality of results produced by any system depends on the quality of awareness from which people in the system operate.
* Presencing blends sensing (feeling the future possibility) and presence (state of being in the present moment). It means sensing and actualizing one's highest future possibility--acting from the presence of what is wanting to emerge.

1. Energy follows attention.
2. Follow the three movements of the U.
  a. Down the U: Observe, observe, observe. Stop downloading, immerse yourself in the places of most potential that matter most to your situation.
  b. At the Bottom: Retreat, and reflect. Allow inner knowing to emerge.
  c. Up the U: Act in an instant. Explore the future by doing. Develop a prototype.
3. Go to the edges of the self. With an open mind, we can suspend old habits of thought. With an open heart, we can empathize. With an open will, we can let go and let the new come.
4. Pass through the eye of the needle. Identify Self as your highest future possibilty, and Work as your sense of purpose or calling.
5. Transform the three enemies.
  a. Voice of doubt and judgement (VoJ), shutting down the open mind.
  b. Voice of cynicism (VoC), shutting down the open heart.
  c. Voice of fear (VoF), shutting down the open will.
6. Always start by "attending to the crack." Identify the openings, challenges, and disruptions where we feel the past ending and the future wanting to begin.
7. Hold space for transforming conversation from debate to dialoge and collective creativity.
8. Avoid the destructive dynamics of absencing.
  a. Denial: not seeing what is going on.
  b. De-sensing: lacking empathy for others.
  c. Absencing: losing connenction to ones' Self.
  d. Delusion: being guided by illusions.
  e. Destruction: destroying others and ourselves.

* Absencing means getting caught in one or more tyrannies (the triple tyranny is referred to as fundamentalism):
  * One Truth (idealism)
  * One "Us" Versus "Them" (collectivism)
  * One Will (fanaticism)

## Evolution of Economic Operating System

* Early economic concepts saw economy as firmly integrated into societal whole, whereas modern economics conceive of economy as an autonomous subsystem.
* Economic monotheism puts primacy in the invisible hand of the market as the one coordination mechanism over all economic activity.
* How is power transmitted in society?
  * Primitive - power is transmitted through violence
  * Developed - power is transmitted through money
  * Advanced - power is transmitted through cultural capital (such as belief systems)
* Economies/Societies transition through exterior challenge (push) and development of conciousness (pull).

* 1.0 - Heirarchy
  * Ideology - state-centric - Strong central actor that holds decision making power of the whole.
  * Pros: Stability
  * Cons: Inhibits individual initiative and freedom.
* 2.0 - Market Competition
  * Ideology - market-centric - State-based legal/military coercive power and/or market-based remunerative power.
  * Pros: Growth
  * Cons: negative externalities such as unbounded commodification and unintended side effects (child labor, human trafficking, environmental destruction, increasing inequality).
* 3.0 - Interest Groups
  * Ideology: communication/discourse-centric - Integrates markets and government.
  * Pros: Addresses Negative Externalities
  * Cons: Disadvantages groups that are too large to easily organize (ie consumers, taxpayers, citizens) or those who do not yet have a voice (future generations)
* 4.0 - Emerging Whole

## Source: Connecting to Intention and Awareness

* 3 Thresholds of Becoming Aware:
  * Suspension - stopping/suspending old habits of judgement and thought.
  * Redirection - listening to views and experiences of others and begin to see reality from a multiplicity of views.
  * Letting Go - connect with who we really are and what we are here for.
* Targets: Individuals Attending, Groups Conversing, Institutions Organizing, and Global Systems Coordinating
* Evolution:
  * Downloading: listener hears ideas, but only to reconfirm what they already know.
  * Factual Listening: listener lets the data talk to them (like a good scientist).
  * Empathic Listening: listener sees reality from the perspective of the other and sense the other person's circumstances.
  * Generative Listening: listener forms a space of deep attention, allowing the emerging future posibility to manifest (like a good coach).
* Solution: Individuals must pay attention to attention (self-awareness), teams must convers about conversation (dialogue), enterprises must organize organizing (networks of networks: eco-systems), and ecosystems must coordinate coordinating (systems of awareness based collective action (ABC)).

# Leading the Personal Inversion: From Me to We

* Evolution of Listening: Habitual, Factual, Empathic, Generative
* Conditions:
  * Bending the Beam of Observation - beam first radiates to the outside world (level 2), then bends back onto the self (level 3), then finds sources of self, becoming present (level 4)
  * A Holding Space for Embracing the Shadow - creating a social holding space through true listening from the heart.
  * Going to the Edge of Letting Go - the willingness to go to the edge of the abyss, to let go, to lean into the unknown, and to take the leap.
* 12 Principles:
  * Practice, Don't Preach
  * Observe, Observe, Observe - become a blackbelt observer and listener.
  * Connect to Your Intention as an Instrument - link work with Work, job with Job, self with Self.
  * When the Crack Opens Up, Stay With It, Connect and Act from the Now - observation and intention connect horizontally and vertically with higher levels of presence and readiness, but you still must act when opportunities arise.
  * Follow Your Heart, Do What You Love, Love What You Do - make sure at least some of your portfolio are things you love doing.
  * Always Be in Dialogue with the Universe - the larger context that surrounds us provides useful feedback. We need to learn to listen and identify the elements of feedback that are helpful to evolve our idea.
  * Create a Holding Space of Deep Listening that Supports Your Journey - seek Self, your capacity to access your highest future possibility. Two of the most effective mechanisms for access are cultivation practices and deep-listening circle work.
  * Iterate, Iterate, Iterate - practice and adapt to what you see emerging.
  * Notice the Crack to the Filed of the Future - attending to openings requires exploring the edges of the system and the self. At the edges, when we are lucky, we can sinse a field of future possibility that is wanting to emerge.
  * Use Different Language with Different Stakeholders - focus on the issues that matter to the audience. Broaden and deepen the definition of the problem to get all relevant parties commited to participation.
  * If You Want to Change Others, Be Open to Changing Yourself First - if you need to change a system without heirarchy, your main leverage is the quality of your relationship with other stakeholders. That is what you must build and strengthen.
  * Never Give Up. Never Give Up. You Are Not Alone - innovation and renewal take enormous amounts of perseverance. Important ideas may take many years of failed effort, and/or practice, before producing something concrete.

# Leading the Relational Inversion: From Ego to Eco

* Instead of just seeing others, we need to learn to see ourselves through the eyes of others and of the whole.
* Habitual Reactions Which Prevent Consequences of Actions from Sinking In: denial, cynicism, and depression.
* Evolution:
  * Unilateral, One-Way Downloading, Manipulation - intent to manipulate, rather than serve the well-being of the other side.
  * Bilateral, Two-Way Discussions, Exchange of Viewpoints - intent to provide/receive information, includes response/feedback mechanism.
  * Multilateral Stakeholder Dialogue, Seeing Oneself Through Eyes of Another - characterized by reflection, learning, and dialogue.
  * Co-creative Eco-system Innovation, Blurring Boundary of Ego and Eco - conversation helping diverse groups to co-sense and co-create the future by transforming awareness from ego to eco.
* Solution: Leverage Points:
  * Get rid of toxic level 1 communication (bribery, soft money, commercials, propaganda and manipulation).
  * Develop new spheres of level 4 co-creative stakeholder relationships, where partners in eco-system can come together to co-sense, prototype, and co-create the future of their eco-system.
* Principle: Energy Follows Attention - focusing only on focusing problems or closing gaps limits creativity.
* We can redraw the boundaries of competition and cooperation by introducing arenas of premarket cooperation among all sectors.
* Five Key Innovation Infrasctructures:
  * Co-Initiating - Successful multistakeholder projects require unconditional commitment from local leaders who are credible in their own communities. The core group that co-initiates the project must reflect the diversity of the overall eco-system.
  * Co-Sensing - To change our mindset we need to explore the edges of the system, seeing other perspectives, particularly from marginalize members. Shadowing practices and stakeholder interviews can help here. This is an area where we have the largest gaps presently.
  * Co-Inspiring - Utilize mindfulness and presencing to connect decision-makers to deep sources of knowing, both individually and collectively.
  * Prototyping, or Exploring the Future By Doing - Stop worrying about what you don't know and start acting on what you do know. Requires dedicated core group with a network of supportive stakeholders and users, a "0.8" prototype (incomplete, but elicits feedback), firm resolve to push forward while integrating feedback, review sessions for all protototypes (conclude what has been learned, take out what isn't working, strengthen what is working).
* Stages of Conversation:
  * Level 1: conforming, or projecting and confirming your existing judgements onto others
  * Level 2: confronting, or surfacing the differences that stakeholders hold as they view the issue from very different angles.
  * Level 3: connecting, or holding different views simultaneously, attending to the observing self - helping a system to see itself (dialogue).
  * Level 4: co-creative flow: attending to sources of creativity and self - helping a system connect to its emerging future self.

# Leading the Institutional Inversion: Toward Eco-Systems Economies

* If you are part of a system whose vital components operate in silos, connect them. Shift locus of leadership from the center to the periphery. Connect these places in ways that facilitate sense-making in more distributed, direct, and dialogic ways.
* Structural evolution:
  * Pyramid - power is centralized at the top.
  * Decentralized - power moves nearer to the bottom
  * Networked - power becomes relational
  * Inverted Pyramid - power moves to surrounding sphere of co-creative relationships
* Government Progression: centralized ruler-centric, abstract/differentiated machine bureaucracy, networked goverment paying attention to citizens, distributed/direct/dialogic system connecting and empowering citizens to co-shape the whole.
* Democracy Progression: one party (centralized), multiparty indirect (parliamentary), participatory indirect (parliamentary), participatory direct/distributed/digital/dialogic (4-D)
* Economic Progression:
  * Control over entire value chain, economies of scope, focus on vertical integration (ie old IBM).
  * Profit, economies of scale, focus on horizontal integration (ie Intel, Microsoft)
  * Eco-system domination, network economies (ie Apple, Facebook, Google)
  * Eco-system stewardship, economies of presencing
* Difference between eco-system domination and eco-system stewardship is intention.
* NGO Progression: alleviating actors (donor-dependent), policy advocates (donor-dependent), multistakeholder or social mission enterprises (partly self-funding), eco-system innovation enterprises (partly or wholly self-funding).
* Banking Progression: traditional banking, casino banking, socially responsible banking, transformative eco-system banking
* Principles:
  * Openness - Shift leadership from inside organization to surrounding sphere.
  * Transparency - Information must be transparent, not secret.
  * Sharing - Ownership of goods must be accessible and intelligently shared.
  * Intention - Organizing revolves around common intention, not structures.
  * Holding Space - Co-creative communities require high-quality core groups and holding spaces.
  * Conversation - Shift from toxic/transactional to dialogic/co-creative.
  * Awareness - Shift from ego-system to eco-system awareness.
  * Commons - Identify, protect, and cultivate commons as base of the whole eco-system.
  * Playfulness - Create a culture that values playfulness, entrepreneurship, and co-creation.
  * Diversity and Symbiosis - Twin principles that allow eco-systems to thrive.

# Leading from the Emerging Future

* 7 elements of University 4.0
  * Global classroom
  * Deep dives into inspiring local, regional, and global innovation hot spots.
  * Awareness-based leadership technologies.
  * Presencing coaching circles.
  * Action learning - co-creating hands-on prototype solutions that are helpful to a specific community or stakeholder constellation
  * Innovation hubs - inverts traditional campus (organized around discipline-based schools) putting emerging future opportunities at the center and organizing disciplines/tools around them.
  * Individualized lifelong learning journeys - today most education is when you need little or none (early in life and career, when you have little experience), while offering little later when your appetite for learning and experience are much greater.
* To facilitate profound innovation learners and leaders need practice fields - new, safe spaces that allow them to protype new behaviors, new mindsets, and new cultures of collaborating across borders.
* The Presencing Institute provides creative-commons based resources around the evolution of this framework and its practical methods and tools.
