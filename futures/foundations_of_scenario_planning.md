# Foundations of Scenario Planning: The Story of Pierre Wack

* Mental models are the true target of scenarios.
* Scenarios have two main purposes: to avoid regret and to see new strategic options you were not previously aware of.
* Scenarios focus less on outcome and more on understanding the forces that compel the outcome; less on figures, and more on insight.
* Scenario planning reclaims the entrepreneurial power of foresight in contexts of accelerated change, greater complexity, and genuine uncertainty.
* Thinking through actions/reactions, side effects and consequences (both intended and unintended) allowed decision makers to rehearse.
* Exploratory scenarios establish the predetermineds and the setting, providing insight into the systems at play. Focused scenarios on the other hand bridge from a decision makers mental model to possible outcomes of a particular decision.
* Good judgement is when one's mental map is a good match with the real world.
* It is fundamental that cdecision makers develop their own feeling of the nature of the system, the forces at work, the underlying uncertainties, and the concepts used to interpret key data.

## Key Capabilities

1. Scenarios
2. Competitive Positioning
3. Strategic Vision (built on insights from 1/2)
4. Option Planning
5. Consensus Bulding

## Building Scenarios

* In a complex and changing environment, you need a plan to understand the forces driving the system, an approach that recognizes uncertainties, and an approach that sensitises to novel information.
* You need not only scenarios, but the nervous system to make it work.
* Start with global scenaries, then develop specific mini-scenarios tailored to large projects or key issues.
* The purpose of scenario planning is option creation, in particular of options that would not have been thought of otherwise.
* It is impartont not to make choices in advance, but to develop options on a neutral, non-advocative basis.
* If the mental models of decision makers do not shift, the scenarios have failed because behavior will not change.
* Focused scenarios are important to match the message to the audience, but the global scenarios are needed to break out of your own preconceived mental model.
* The ideal number of mini-scenarios is two, highlighting the principal uncertainty, plus the baseline scenario.
* Scenarios should lead decision makers to question their inner model of reality and change it as nessecary, in order to take action they would not be ashamed of later.
* When the world changes, the organization needs a common view of the new world. Scenarios provide a powerful way to express and communicate new realities.

## Rooting

* Scenarios will only be accepted when their predetermineds have entered the mind of decision makers and been accepted, which Wack called "rooting."
* Rooting requires deep analysis of predetermineds going back far enough in time for a common interpretation of data and events. Perceptions can thene be organized in a global framework coupled with metaphors to transpose from the old domain of experience to what will be a new one.

## Decision Scenarios (mini-scenarios)

Explore and expand predetermined:

1. Events "already in the pipeline," but whose consequences have yet to unfold
2. interdependence within the system (surprise outcomes often arise from interconnectedness)
3. trend breaks (ie unfoldings that cannot continue)
4. the "impossible"

* One of the most useful structuring exercises is to focus on and rule out the impossible; decision-scenarios usually deny more than they affirm
* Decision scenarios describe different worlds, not just different outcomes of the same world.
* Ideally provide the surprise free implicit view (showing explicitly why and where it is fragile) and two other worlds (or ways of seeing the world) whose "logic" or main theme focuses on critical uncertainties
* The point is not to "get it right" as to have a set of scenarios illuminating major forces driving the system, their interrelationships and critical uncertainties. The purpose is to help decision makers sharpen their focus on key questions about the environment, and to aid them via additional concepts and a richer language system through which to exchange ideas and new data.
* Be wary of three scenarios describing outcomes along one dimension, leading to a temptation to pick the middle one, or two scenarios which can be seen as "pessimistic" and "optimistic".

# Additional Tools

* Stratagic Vision supplements scenarios by providing a clear structured view of what kind of company you want to be, which precedes what you want to do.
* Option planning, or more importantly option generation.

## Key Elements

* Team - diverse membership and perspectives
* Isolation and Inspiration - 'in the green' focused offsites
* Tension - some disagreement/argument is important to not take things for granted
* Meditation - importance of reflection and allowing for intuition as well as data
* Testing Ideas
* Predetermined Elements - actions which have already been taken, but whose consequences are not yet known
* Remarkable People - maintaining a network of diverse people to gather insights and perspective from
* Presentations - the best scenarios are even more effective when accompanied with effective storytelling
* Mental Models - understanding existing mental models (usually via interviews) allowed scenarios to be tailored toward the audience
* Decisions - Wack concluded that if scenarios did not link to present day decisions, they were incomplete. In addition to understanding mental models, it's important to establish from the start what critical decisions are looming.

## Areas for Potential Development

* generating options - identify real decisions and options early, then remain open to new options emerging during the process
* footprints - access options within and across scenarios and display the assessment visually. ie rank each 1-10 for risk and benefit and scatterplot.

## Quotes

> It is almost impossible to break out of an inappropriate mental frame while perceiving and experiencing within it. As the Chinese proverb says "The fish is the last to know it swims in water."

> And then you have the corporate rain dance, you know, at a certain time at a particular pace on the calendar, at the end of the dry season, start the corporate rain dance. It has no impact whatsoever on the weather but everything that come afterwards is nicely linked to and explained by this rain dance. And some people enjoy it very much.

> A strategy should always be a concept for changing the existing competitive advantage. IF it is not, you know, it is not a real strategy. And it must be very clear on the cause and effect relationship that will bring the new equilibrium along.
