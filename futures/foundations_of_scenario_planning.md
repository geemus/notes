# Foundations of Scenario Planning: The Story of Pierre Wack

* Mental models are the true target of scenarios.
* Scenarios have two main purposes: to avoid regret and to see new strategic options you were not previously aware of.
* Scenarios focus less on outcome and more on understanding the forces that compel the outcome; less on figures, and more on insight.
* Scenario planning reclaims the entrepreneurial power of foresight in contexts of accelerated change, greater complexity, and genuine uncertainty.
* Thinking through actions/reactions, side effects and consequences (both intended and unintended) allowed decision makers to rehearse.
* Exploratory scenarios establish the predetermineds and the setting, providing insight into the systems at play. Focused scenarios on the other hand bridge from a decision makers mental model to possible outcomes of a particular decision.
* Good judgement is when one's mental map is a good match with the real world.
* It is fundamental that cdecision makers develop their own feeling of the nature of the system, the forces at work, the underlying uncertainties, and the concepts used to interpret key data.

## Key Capabilities

1. Scenarios
2. Competitive Positioning
3. Strategic Vision (built on insights from 1/2)
4. Option Planning
5. Consensus Bulding

## Building Scenarios

* In a complex and changing environment, you need a plan to understand the forces driving the system, an approach that recognizes uncertainties, and an approach that sensitises to novel information.
* You need not only scenarios, but the nervous system to make it work.
* Start with global scenaries, then develop specific mini-scenarios tailored to large projects or key issues.
* The purpose of scenario planning is option creation, in particular of options that would not have been thought of otherwise.
* It is impartont not to make choices in advance, but to develop options on a neutral, non-advocative basis.
* If the mental models of decision makers do not shift, the scenarios have failed because behavior will not change.
* Focused scenarios are important to match the message to the audience, but the global scenarios are needed to break out of your own preconceived mental model.
* The ideal number of mini-scenarios is two, highlighting the principal uncertainty, plus the baseline scenario.
* Scenarios should lead decision makers to question their inner model of reality and change it as nessecary, in order to take action they would not be ashamed of later.
* When the world changes, the organization needs a common view of the new world. Scenarios provide a powerful way to express and communicate new realities.

## Rooting

* Scenarios will only be accepted when their predetermineds have entered the mind of decision makers and been accepted, which Wack called "rooting."
* Rooting requires deep analysis of predetermineds going back far enough in time for a common interpretation of data and events. Perceptions can thene be organized in a global framework coupled with metaphors to transpose from the old domain of experience to what will be a new one.

## Decision Scenarios (mini-scenarios)

Explore and expand predetermined:

1. Events "already in the pipeline," but whose consequences have yet to unfold
2. interdependence within the system (surprise outcomes often arise from interconnectedness)
3. trend breaks (ie unfoldings that cannot continue)
4. the "impossible"

* One of the most useful structuring exercises is to focus on and rule out the impossible; decision-scenarios usually deny more than they affirm
* Decision scenarios describe different worlds, not just different outcomes of the same world.
* Ideally provide the surprise free implicit view (showing explicitly why and where it is fragile) and two other worlds (or ways of seeing the world) whose "logic" or main theme focuses on critical uncertainties
* The point is not to "get it right" as to have a set of scenarios illuminating major forces driving the system, their interrelationships and critical uncertainties. The purpose is to help decision makers sharpen their focus on key questions about the environment, and to aid them via additional concepts and a richer language system through which to exchange ideas and new data.
* Be wary of three scenarios describing outcomes along one dimension, leading to a temptation to pick the middle one, or two scenarios which can be seen as "pessimistic" and "optimistic".

# Additional Tools

* Stratagic Vision supplements scenarios by providing a clear structured view of what kind of company you want to be, which precedes what you want to do.
* Option planning, or more importantly option generation.

## Key Elements

* Team - diverse membership and perspectives
* Isolation and Inspiration - 'in the green' focused offsites
* Tension - some disagreement/argument is important to not take things for granted
* Meditation - importance of reflection and allowing for intuition as well as data
* Testing Ideas
* Predetermined Elements - actions which have already been taken, but whose consequences are not yet known
* Remarkable People - maintaining a network of diverse people to gather insights and perspective from
* Presentations - the best scenarios are even more effective when accompanied with effective storytelling
* Mental Models - understanding existing mental models (usually via interviews) allowed scenarios to be tailored toward the audience
* Decisions - Wack concluded that if scenarios did not link to present day decisions, they were incomplete. In addition to understanding mental models, it's important to establish from the start what critical decisions are looming.

## Areas for Potential Development

* generating options - identify real decisions and options early, then remain open to new options emerging during the process
* footprints - access options within and across scenarios and display the assessment visually. ie rank each 1-10 for risk and benefit and scatterplot.

## Quotes

> It is almost impossible to break out of an inappropriate mental frame while perceiving and experiencing within it. As the Chinese proverb says "The fish is the last to know it swims in water."

> And then you have the corporate rain dance, you know, at a certain time at a particular pace on the calendar, at the end of the dry season, start the corporate rain dance. It has no impact whatsoever on the weather but everything that come afterwards is nicely linked to and explained by this rain dance. And some people enjoy it very much.

> A strategy should always be a concept for changing the existing competitive advantage. IF it is not, you know, it is not a real strategy. And it must be very clear on the cause and effect relationship that will bring the new equilibrium along.

# Foundations of Scenario Planning: The Story of Pierre Wack (Routledge International Studies in Business History) by Thomas J Chermack
- Wack was an advocate of relentless curiosity, and he was a man genuinely interested in the world. He promoted the utility of intuition and the magical flashes of insight that emanate from stilling the mind in Zen meditation, yet he simultaneously prioritized facts and the ability to perceive them accurately. On this topic, Wack was fond of quoting Paul Valery, the twentieth-century French philosopher. He said, “Un fait mal observe est plus pernicieux qu’un mauvais raiseonnement.” A poorly observed fact is more treacherous than a faulty train of reasoning. (475)
- Wack would retell this story many times throughout his career to communicate some of the key purposes of scenario planning—changing your state of mind, hearing a sound deeply, striking the mental models of managers like the stone against the bamboo—these are all powerful images he used to get ideas across. (611)
- Wack’s metaphor of the company as an animal using its claw or beak is a perfect example of what was so engaging about him. And it was a preview of his later interest in competitive positioning. Companies could behave like animals to take advantage of their assets. They could run and hide—take care of their corner of their habitat. Or dominate and attack—again based on their assets and strengths. And every company is likely to employ all of these techniques at some point. (979)
- Wack’s realization that the mental models were the true targets of scenarios became a foundation for scenarios from then on. (1941)
- Thinking through the possible actions and reactions, as well as the side effects and consequences (both intended and unintended) allowed decision makers to rehearse the future in ways they had never before been able to do. (2019)
- The other major discovery in the early evolution of scenarios was the difference between exploratory and focused scenarios. Wack even called these “mini-scenarios” later on. He further emphasized that they were faster to create and easier to work with than the more macro exploratory scenarios. But Wack was clear that if you jump directly to the focused scenarios, you miss key elements—particularly the predetermineds. This led Wack to a tiered scenario approach—you start with the exploratory learning scenarios and then zoom into the focused decision scenarios. (2029)
- THE SEVEN QUESTIONS (not fixed but modified and evolving) 1  The Oracle If you could visit with someone who really could foretell the future, are there any questions that you might like to ask? 2  Good World What is your perception of an optimistic, but realistic world future, and its implications for Shell? 3  Bad World What is your perception of a pessimistic, but not catastrophic world future, and its implications for Shell? 4  Corporate Culture Where would your perception of the culture Shell will need to develop in the future differ from what now exists? 5  Looking Back What have we not done well, where we had the information to do better, and what can we learn from this? 6  Critical Choices What are the critical decisions which the Group is preparing to take, or should prepare to take, over the next 5–10 years? 7  Personal Vision If you could personally choose the vision for Shell, is there anything further that you would wish to contribute? (This question has evolved from ‘For what would you personally like to be remembered?). (2427)
- In Pierre’s view the main purpose of scenario thinking is to come to a point where one sees the world as no one has seen it before and the potential for a new strategy is born. Scenarios can do that for you, but it is not a trivial matter. It certainly is not, in Pierre’s opinion, a mechanistic process in which one works through a predetermined set of steps during one or two workshops. Instead it is a process of long-lasting commitment to deep thinking about the situation, a willingness to find out what the world already knows, and a willingness to engage with what Pierre called “remarkable people,” not necessarily experts but people who enjoy looking at the situation in multiple and unexpected ways. (3897)
- Key Elements of Wack’s Scenario Approach (4128)
- Team (4136)
- Isolation and Inspiration (4152)
- Tension (4159)
- Meditation (4173)
- Testing Ideas (4180)
- Predetermined Elements (4196)
- Predetermined elements are the results of actions that have already been taken, but their consequences are not yet known. (4198)
- Remarkable People (4203)
- At Shell, he was an insider, and even though he was eccentric, he had an oil mental model, and an economist’s mental model. He was using his network of remarkable people to ensure his own biases didn’t rule the scenario work for which he was responsible. Quite literally, when he invited people to visit Shell, they were performing the function of an external consultant. (4204)
- The major insight here is that to maximize the effectiveness of scenarios, there must be an internal responsibility for it. Otherwise, the work becomes subject to a consultant and a contract which can jeopardize insight. (4210)
- Presentations (4211)
- Wack’s interest in stories from different cultures and how he wove them into his scenario presentations was a part of his mystique. (4214)
- He would use such ideas to demonstrate the ways in which other cultures generally thought about things, particularly when they were different from the traditional Anglo-Dutch culture of Shell. (4216)
- Mental Models (4221)
- Mental models became perhaps the most lasting and central feature of Wack’s scenario approach when he realized that the early scenario attempts failed because they had no connection to managers’ deepest concerns. He knew he needed to find a way to make the link. (4221)
- Wack began interviewing managers as the first step of scenario work. He spent the rest of his career refining and developing his interview craft, determined to be able to see inside the minds he was trying to change. Understanding the mental models gave him valuable knowledge about how people framed their experiences, and their decision making tendencies. (4224)
- Decisions (4227)
- Finally, Wack concluded that if scenarios did not link to present day decisions, only half of the exercise was complete. (4227)
- Studying peoples’ mental models through interviewing reveals the things foremost on their minds. It is equally important to identify the critical decisions right at the start of any scenario effort. (4233)
- Probabilities are more of a nuisance than a help in the non-trivial process of communicating scenarios to management. By focusing on the outcome instead of developing an understanding of the forces leading to an outcome, they will have a superficial and mechanical impact, and will not change management mind-sets in depth. More important, in the development of the scenario, the use of probabilities seems to direct the attention and efforts of the scenario designer in the wrong direction. (4243)
- There are two opportunities for significant development in scenario planning that come directly from Wack’s unfinished work. They focus on generating management options, and “footprints,” both of which Wack described in his final presentations to the Operating Companies in 1982. (4266)
- However, these two underutilized tools can support the connection between scenarios and decision making—Wack’s own ultimate intent. (4269)
- The message is clear—identify real decisions and their related options early on in the scenario work, and remain open to new options that may emerge from the hard work of developing the scenarios. (4278)
- Footprints appear more complicated than they are—the idea is to assess options within and across the scenarios and display that assessment visually. (4280)
- Imagine a simple set of options. For each option, the risk and potential benefit could be approximated by a ranking from 1–10. Option 1 could have a ranking of 8 on risk, and 10 on potential benefit. (4281)
- The outcome is a scatterplot, in which each data point represents an individual’s assessment of the option. The process must be replicated in two ways: first, for each scenario (because the dynamics of each scenario would be different, and therefore the rankings would change), and second, for each option. (4284)
- It is easy to see how a process like this can connect scenarios to decisions, and seeing the footprint move in the different scenarios provides unique information for decision makers. Yet, it does not appear to be a tool commonly used with scenarios, and it remains an opportunity to evolve scenario methods in new direction. The example here used risk and benefit as the main parameters; however, almost any variables could be used. Cost, timeline, financial return, capital expenditures, cost of energy, cost of labor, product price, etc. would all be useful assessment dimensions depending on the context and decisions. (4290)
- We live in a world of great impatience and lack of commitment. Decision makers want answers and recommendations quickly, as if insight can be achieved through a rote process which simply needs to be executed more efficiently. But experience has taught again and again that insight and innovation do not work that way. (4303)
- The antidote is equally simple. If serious insights about the future are expected to come from scenario planning, it must become a dedicated function inside the organization. And it requires support and patience to develop the function—insights will not come overnight. (4311)
- And then you have the corporate rain dance, you know, at a certain time at a particular pace on the calendar, at the end of the dry season, start the corporate rain dance. It has no impact whatsoever on the weather but everything that come afterwards is nicely linked to and explained by this rain dance. And some people enjoy it very much. (4421)
- One decision alone is never a strategy—it is a coup. It is the combination, a congruence of decisions, on the one hand that makes the difference. (4428)
- So my second question becomes: Is it possible in a large company like Shell where we need to convince others, is it possible to institutionalise this creative foresight which is usually the product of an individual. (4453)
- Remember, when you have learned to play a musical instrument or if you have trained for a sport there are always some elements of technique; but the key element of the discipline is a standard of excellence. Same thing for strategic planning. (4458)
- I strongly believe that it is possible, provided we really gain—let’s say modestly—”gain excellence” in 5 capabilities, not one, five. (4460)
- Scenarios, yes, but use of scenarios as well as development. Competitive positioning, this is something very important. (4462)
- From these two elements you get insights for developing a strategic vision. (4466)
- Option planning, by this I mean realising that in any situation there is more than just one possibility. (4468)
- And finally sequential consensus building. (4469)
- But you don’t need to plan everything, you only need to plan, gentlemen, when the speed of change in the business environment is faster than your own speed of reaction. (4476)
- For a number of reasons the speed of change in our business environment has increased and you realise it. And our own speed of reaction for a variety of reasons has decreased. As a result the space where you need to plan, not report but plan, has increased. And, gentlemen, in this space either you plan or you will be planned for by others. (4480)
- But forecasts fail you just when you need them most. Forecasts fail to announce major shifts, major discontinuities in the business environment, which render our strategies obsolete. (4506)
- In this new habitat traditional planning (based on forecasts/past experience) is in an evolutionary cul de sac of increasing uncertainty—a change as from hard skin to internal vertebrae. (4518)
- What you need for a clear foresight-based plan is a clear understanding of the forces that drive the system, and not the substitute for thinking which is the one-line forecast. (4528)
- Secondly, you need an approach that recognises uncertainty, chains of uncertainty, which does not push it under the table, on the contrary, which puts it on the table. (4529)
- And finally you need an approach which sensitises to novel information. (4533)
- So it is not good enough to have scenarios, you must have a nervous system to make it work. (4538)
- This is what we call the nervous system. You start with global scenarios. You then develop specific scenarios, mini-scenario, custom-tailored around either a large project or around a key strategic issue. (4539)
- the purpose of the scenario and the scenario system is not to produce scenarios, the purpose is option creation, is to generate new options that you would not have thought of otherwise. (4543)
- We have a perceptual world framework and scenario planning means having two or more of these frameworks. And it breaks your condition. It helps you to reperceive the situation. (4558)
- Everyone, you and your neighbour, you have, we have, a mental image of the world in which we have to act. This mental picture is based on past experience and on the information we have digested. If we have a decision to take we confront the alternatives of behaviour with this mental image. And when a man takes good judgment, takes good decisions people say he has good judgment. In fact he has largely a mental map, a mental image, which is a good match with the real world. (4595)
- Now unless the micro-cosm of the manager is really affected by scenarios nothing happens. (4599)
- Be careful, while this is the right way to apply scenarios, to focus scenarios, remember that scenarios are like cameras, they get all their power when you focus them. But you cannot do focused scenarios until you have dome global scenarios. (4657)
- You get the benefits of scenarios by the specific scenarios, not the global scenarios, but you need the global scenarios to break your conditioning, otherwise it is too narrow and it is just going back to sensitivity analysis. (4662)
- And let me stress something important, profit, gentlemen, profit is a late warning signal. When profit has deteriorated it is sure that the competitive position has deteriorated way before. (4670)
- Suppose two powders, a black powder, coal, and a white powder, flour. And suppose I mix them well at our scale of observation it is a grey powder. But suppose little insects the size of the grain of flour, from their scale of observation they would see black rocks and white rocks. Unless you go at the scale where you can see black rocks and white rocks competitive positioning is meaningless. This is the difficulty. It is not uncertainty, it is finding the right scale of observation. (4674)
- A strategy should always be a concept for changing the existing competitive advantage. If it is not, you know, it is not a real strategy. And it must be very clear on the cause and effect relationship that will bring the new equilibrium along. (4683)
- There are three things that are critical, first the concept of asymmetry. That you really get above-average returns through differences, through advantages, and not by being the same as the others. (4685)
- The concept of barrier, which is very critical. A barrier is a competitive protection, which costs you less to defend than it costs the competitor to overcome. (4686)
- And always in your strategy you think what the competitor will do. (4688)
- And the key one is the last one, do not make choices in advance, develop the options on a neutral, non-advocative basis. (4755)
- The problem with vision is twofold. In a large company several managers can have several vision, and you can have frictions. And the second point, which is more important, because vision is such a powerful tool if your vision happens to be wrong it can be devastating. (4784)
- In most cases in Japan their strategic vision is really the product of a group, it is not the product of an individual which makes it very interesting. (4805)
- In many cases knowledge comes from wonder, from amazement. (4810)
- Let me stress a very striking constant in all Japanese strategies I have seen. The two most important inputs are input by the R&D vice—president and by the personnel vice-president. (4825)
- It is a system for dominance. Every word is important. It is a system. It is not one decision, it is the combination of decisions. One decision never makes a strategy, it is a coup and it goes away. This is a lasting strategy in a system. For dominance. You really want to dominate one part of your habitat, one segment of the market. If you don’t want that then you don’t need a strategic vision. It is cumbersome. (4853)
- I would like to stress very strongly that strategic vision is not merely the product of a quick brainstorming at the end of an afternoon. It is really rooted in serious analysis, on both sides, the business environment and competitive relationships. And you have a clear view of what are the critical factors for success. (4859)
- It is expressed as a commitment to excellence in a few key capabilities, more than 2 but less than 10. (4861)
- And it is combined, coalesced into a unity and it is existentially experienced as a clear vision of what company you want to be. (4863)
- What scenarios are for dealing with uncertainty in the business environment, strategic vision is for dealing with uncertainty on the strategy side. (4869)
- We need an element of permanence. Because the way it is constructed a strategic vision is such an element of permanence in a turbulent world. (4871)
- It is a marvellous complexity reducer. It changes your daily life. Suddenly you know what is really very important to watch. This is one of the greatest practical advantages of strategic vision. (4873)
- Those of you who know Japan know how much Japanese companies use their personnel as a tool for gathering information. Now if you would do this without a framework of what is essential you would only increase your overload of information. (4875)
- Most of our information systems is focused on the operational profit, which are very important. But next to the operational focus you have something very important, the profit potential. (4882)
- Development is a relative concept. You are developed compared to your development potential. If you increase your development potential at the same speed, or faster, than your development you stay underdeveloped. (4907)
- The same thing: a strategic vision has as it objective to focus on the development potential. (4910)
- A normal plan, if it is expressed in financial terms, or even a policy statement I bet you, nobody has the memory of the policy statement in a normal daily discussion. (4915)
- Only a strategic vision, because it is qualitatively different, can keep a share of the attention. (4916)
- At a certain time the progress of knowledge is such that the basic building blocks are available and what you really need is a combining element. This is really input creativity. I would like to strongly suggest that this system is an approach which gives you much better building blocks on which to exercise your creativity. (4946)
- The only solution, I believe, is to accept uncertainty, try to understand it and make it part of your reasoning. (5006)
- Most scenarios merely quantify alternative outcomes of obvious uncertainties (e.g., the price of oil may be $20 or $40 per barrel). Such scenarios are not helpful to decision makers. We call them “first generation” scenarios. (5014)
- Scenarios can be successful in structuring uncertainty only when (1) they are based on a sound analysis of reality, and (2) they change the decision makers’ assumptions about how the world works and compel him to change his image of reality. (5018)
- Strictly speaking, it is only possible to forecast the future when all its elements are predetermined. By predetermined elements, we mean those events that have already occurred (or which almost certainly will occur) but whose consequences haven’t yet unfolded. (5030)
- That, too is our experience: most of the errors of judgment in future-oriented studies come not so much from faulty reasoning but from poorly, insufficiently observed facts. (5038)
- Scenarios will either help the decision maker, or be of little use to him, depending on how they are constructed and presented, not just on the information they contain. It is like architects who can create a well—or poorly designed building, even though both use all the same materials of construction (5096)
- While it is often the least likely outcome, its inclusion enables them to recognize their outlook in the scenario package. It is their entry—their bridge—into the future: without the surprise-free scenario, all possibilities may appear alien to the managers and they may reject the process out-of-hand. (5124)
- Here, we had just presented the raw uncertainties. Our managers had no basis on which to exercise their judgment. The task for use was to devise ways to help them understand the nature of these uncertainties and to structure ways they could come to grips with them. (5164)
- What, in time, we can to learn was that these first-generation scenarios are always learning scenarios; their purpose is not action, but to gain understanding and insight. The first-generation scenarios map out the future context. With that done and some of the predetermined elements identified, you then push to find others not obviously predetermined. (5166)
- In this way, we learned of many outcomes that were simply not possible under any reasonable set of assumptions. (5170)
- Thus, our exploratory scenarios became good search tools. They had yet to become effective planning devices, but without them we would have been unable to develop the next generation of scenarios. (5171)
- We therefore created a set of “challenge scenarios,” the B-family. Here the basic premise was that somehow, sufficient energy supply would be available, and as discontinuity of energy supply would appear. These three scenarios would serve not only to challenge the assumptions underlying the A-family of scenarios, but could also destroy many of the comfortable business-as-usual aspects of the “world view” so many in Shell were still operating by. (5267)
- This might be a useful point to remark parenthetically about two aspects of the scenarios that we learned only later. Six scenarios are far too many. The ideal number is two, which highlight the principal uncertainty being focused on, plus the consensus or surprise-free scenario. (5273)
- Another insight later gained was the importance of naming the scenarios. A well-chosen name conveys to the decision maker the essence of what drives the scenario; it also reduces the detail you must provide him and not only encourages him to fill in the detail (making the scenario alive for him) but leaves him room to do so. (5275)
- Scenarios focused less on outcomes and more on understanding of the forces that would compel the outcome; less on figures, and more on insight. (5328)
- Reality was painful: most studies dealing with the future business environment, and now including these first scenarios, have a very low existential effectiveness. (We would define “existential effectiveness” as single-mindedness; but the Japanese express it much better—“When there is no break, not even the thickness of a hair, between a man’s vision and his action.”) (5333)
- When someone has a decision to make, he confronts alternative ways of behaving with his mental model. When it proved to be a good decision, others say he has good judgment. In fact, what he has is a mental map that largely matches the real world. (5341)
- The perception a company has of its business environment is in fact as important as it infrastructure of investment, because the strategy the company adopts will be the product of this perception, of how it sees the world—its world. (5347)
- I cannot overemphasize this point: unless the microcosm—individual or corporate—is changed, no change in behavior will occur; the internal compass must be recalibrated. (5349)
- Our initial aim had been to produce scenarios that we would not be ashamed of when subsequently confronted with the reality. From this point on, we wanted to design scenarios that would lead our decision makers to question their inner model of reality and change it as necessary, in order to take action they would not be ashamed of later. This was a fundamental change in perspective, as fundamental as when on organization switches from selling to marketing. (5354)
- The planner will succeed, however, only if he can securely link the outside world, the business environment he scans, to the microcosm of the decision maker. Good scenarios provide this vital “bridge”; but it must be firmly anchored on both sides—it must deal with managers’ real concerns, as well as external reality. Otherwise, there is a risk that no one will bother to cross the bridge. (5406)
- What basic message could be conveyed from the center that would be meaningful for managers in many diverse companies around the world? We borrowed the concept of archetypes from human character analysis. (5444)
- In our view, nations would try to cope with this major discontinuity by either a market-force approach or by a government-intervention (dirigiste) approach. In their pure forms, these responses became our archetypes, and we explored each of them fully. We did not imagine that any country would follow either archetype absolutely, but we believe, for example, that West Germany’s response would be heavily market-oriented, while that of its neighbor, France, would be more dirigiste. (5448)
- Strategies are the product of a world view. When the world view changes, there must be some common view of the new world throughout the group, or the decentralized strategic decisions that result could lead to anarchy. Scenarios provide a powerful way to express and communicate a common view of the new realities to all parts of the organization. (5478)
- We would strive instead to apply all we had learned in the previous scenario exercises” expand the predetermineds scenarios would then deal with the uncertainties link to those deepest concerns keep the scenario number small give them names (5510)
- Scenarios of the future will only be accepted when their common elements, the PREDETERMINEDS, have entered the mind of the decision makers, unfold in it, and are accepted. We call this process “rooting.” (5513)
- To be successful, this rooting process requires: A deep analysis of the predetermineds. You must go back in time far enough to provide for a common interpretation to events and data. Perceptions to be organized in a global framework (as in Chart XIII). This is material directed to the right part of the brain the one that thinks in terms of pattern and connectedness. Metaphors are frequently helpful to transpose a conceptual framework from the old domain of experience to what will be a new one. (5517)
- Scenarios on their own,—i.e., the mere description of alternative courses of events—would be effective and alive just as long as a tree without roots. And many of the scenarios I have seen suffer this fate. (5521)
- There are two main purposes of scenarios: one is to avoid regret; the other is positive and creative—to see new strategic options that you were not previously aware of. (5687)
- As K. MacMahon of the Bank of England has so successfully observed: “No time is as usefully wasted as that spent guarding against disasters that do not in the event occur.” (5691)
- Scenario analysis is a disciplines way to think about the future. It demands above all an understanding of the forces that drive the system, rather than reliance on forecasts (5728)
- For this it is fundamental that decision makers develop their own feeling of the nature of the system, the forces at work within it, the uncertainties that underlie the alternative scenarios, and the concepts used to interpret key data. (5733)
- The foundation of decision scenarios is exploring and expanding the predetermined: (1) events “already in the pipeline,” but whose consequences have yet to unfold; (2) interdependence within the system (surprise outcomes often arise from interconnectedness), (3) trend breaks i.e., unfoldings that cannot continue, and (4) the “impossible.” One of the most useful structuring of decision scenarios is to focus on and rule out the impossible events; decision-scenarios usually deny much more than they affirm. (5735)
- Neither are decision scenarios a group of quasi-forecasts, one of which is like to be the right one. Instead, decision scenarios describe different “worlds,” not just a different outcome of the same world. (5746)
- Never more than four (or it becomes unmanageable for most decision makers); the ideal number is “1 + 2”—i.e., the surprise free implicit view (showing explicitly why and where it is fragile), and then two other “worlds” or different ways of seeing the world, whose “logic” or main theme focuses on the critical uncertainties. (5747)
- The point, to repeat, is not so much to have one scenario which “gets it right” as to have a set of scenarios which illuminate the major forces driving the system, their interrelationships and the critical uncertainties. The purpose, in short, is to help decision makers sharpen their focus on key questions about the environment, and to aid them via additional concepts and a richer language system through which to exchange ideas and new data. (5750)
- The most dangerous scenario design is three scenarios that describe alternative outcomes along one dimension only, because many managers cannot resist the temptation to identify with the middle one as a “base line” and treat it essentially as a forecast. A scheme based on two scenarios raises a similar risk if the two are easily seen as “optimistic” and “pessimistic.” (5754)
- Finally, scenarios are most effective when used with two other tools. (5773)
- Strategic Vision A clear, structured view of what kind of company you want to be, which precedes what you want to do (investing, divesting, penetrating a new market, etc.). (5773)
- Option Planning In most planning approaches, strategies are put forward on a single line (which is more dangerous even that single line forecasting), and options—if there are any—are merely straw men, not real options. (5775)
- The purpose of this combined approach is “option generation.” If the scenario process does not bring about the emergence of strategic options which were previously not even considered, the process has been sterile. (5779)
- The important point is: it is almost impossible to break out of an inappropriate mental frame while perceiving and experiencing within it. As the Chinese proverb says “The fish is the last to know it swims in water.” (5812)
- But it times of rapid change and increased complexity the mental model becomes a dangerously mixed bag: enormously rich detail and deep understanding can coexist with dubious assumptions, selective inattention to alternative ways of interpretive evidence, and projections that are a mere pretense—blind spots and dead angles. It is here that the scenario approach has leverage and can make the difference. (5822)
- Decision-scenarios, by being alternative “ways of seeing the world,” are a systematic method for breaking out of this one-eyed view. (5827)
- Scenario planning, to repeat, is a discipline aimed at rediscovering the original entrepreneurial power of foresight in contexts of accelerated change, greater complexity and genuine uncertainty. (5837)
