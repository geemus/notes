# A Checklist for Evaluating Forecasts

Based on Andy Hines article in The Futurist; Nov 1995; 29,6; pg 20

01. Author: What are the credentials of the author or institution? Do they have biases? Are they advocates, enthusiasts, or opponents?
02. Method: Is a formal method used (e.g. Delphi, trend analysis, scenario planning)?
03. Assumptions: What are the primary assumptions--the underlying beliefs and attitudes that influence the forecast? Are they stated or implicit?
04. Time Horizon: Is a specific time frame given, or can it be discerned?
05. Forecasts: What are the specific projections?
06. Trigger Events: Are there guideposts that can be monitored to measure how the forecast is tracking?
07. Key Capabilities: What new capabilities does the forecast project will be made available to society?
08. Missing Items: Is there something the authors overlooked--a key social force, a competing technology, a new actor, or a hidden assumption?
09. Implications: What does the forecast mean to you, your organization, or society? Does it provide insight for your strategies, policies, and actions today?
10. Evaluation: Does it hang together? Is it clear how the author gets from the present to the future?
