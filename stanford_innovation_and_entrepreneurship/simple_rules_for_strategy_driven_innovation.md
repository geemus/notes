# Real Time Strategy

## Simple Rules

More uncertain environments are better served by simpler strategies.

### Simple Rule Features

* Simple rules are simple -- just a handful (6 or less, 2-3 ideally)
* Unique to the person and situation
* Relate to a specific activity, not generalities

### Simple Rule Types

* Boundary - Which opportunities to pick
* Priority - Preferred opportunities (harder)
* Stopping - When to quit (hardest)
* How-to - How to proceed & what to do
* Coordination - How to work w/others
* Timing - When to proceed (harder)

### Creating Simple Rules
1. Determine primary objective (what you want more of or less of)
2. Find the bottleneck to achieving that objective?
3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck, sources for ideas:
  * Get expert advise, may help but probably not tailored to your context
  * Analyze your own data/history
  * Advise from friend's and peers

# Short-term Strategy

## Gene Sequence

Drive sustained, profitable growth by expanding from core business.

### Gene Sequence Practices

* genetic evolution
* inverse power law: lots of small changes, some medium changes, occasional large changes
* mix old/traditional and new
* get to the future sooner, cheaper, and with less risk by leveraging the past (not everything has to be green field)

### Successful Expansion Through Simple Rules

* Never put core business at risk.
* Make adjacency move only if you expect to end up among the top three players in the new space.
* Pursue one opportunity at a time.
* Change one variable at a time.

### How to Grow into Adjacencies

* expand along value chain (one of the most difficult options)
* grow new products and services
* use new distribution channels
* enter new geographies
* address new customer segments, often by modifying proven product or technology
* move into the "white space" with a new business unit built around a strong capability (rarest and most difficult)

### Benefits of Repeatable Formula

* learning-curve - allows refinement of skills and systematization of processes
* reduced complexity by changing only one thing at a time - allows more consistency/repeatability
* speed - allows moving through process faster due to refinements/systematization/etc
* strategic clarity - repeatability is compelling and easy to understand

### Sources of Repeatability

* Segmenting Customers - understand needs of customers
* Growing Share of Wallet - sell related stuff to existing customers
* Mirroring Customer Adjacencies - track customer plans and anticipate their needs

# Long-term Strategy

## Probing

### Probing Best Practices

* Probe the future using a wide variety of low-cost probes.
* Manage number of probes, not just types. More probes and variety in response to more uncertainty.
* Follow identity of company, not vision of industry.
* Clear hypotheses to make goals explicit and improve over time.
* Constant thin attention to the future, not just reactionary or episodic planning.
* Focus on learning from temporary efforts, not delivering permanent business value.

### Why Probing is Effective

* You learn through small losses (big losses lead to defensiveness, wins are seen as foregone conclusions).
* People learn in different ways, use lots of types of probes to get a clearer, fuller picture.
* Hypotheses clarify what you want to learn, and by being more explicit it is more likely you will reveal errors which can be learned from (whereas these might get lost in a weak/loose hypothesis).

## Time Pacing

### Time Pacing Best Practices

* Avoid natural tendency to delay and/or change too little
* Allows for time to reflect/introspect
* Synchronize a complex task. Utilize fastest constant speed, rather than fastest speed with variability.
* People learn to pace themselves
* Create focus that is motivating and confidence-inspiring

### How to Time Pace

* Look for existing rhythms to exploit
* Set the pace/rhythm, if possible
* Structure/choreograph transitions

# Module 1: Course Overview

# Module 2: Strategy in Real Time

## 2.1 Introducing Strategy

Strategy as structured chaos.

* More uncertain environments should have simpler strategies
* Time is central to strategy, with longer time horizons, a focus on rhythm over speed, and attention to time-related metrics
* organization drives strategy

* video game strategy - play the game and strategy becomes apparent
* velcro organization - known/knowable current state (ie open vs closed) and quick to change

## 2.2 Strategy as Simple Rules

### Best Practices

* Focus on bottleneck strategic process and a few simple rules.
* Success is driven by more information, not less
* Business unit teams are central to success
* Innovation AND efficiency

### Simple Rules Examples

* Big Pharma - R&D
  * clear ranking of molecule types as research priorities
  * maximum number of types pursued at one time
  * projects "killed" according to step charts
* Internet Venture - Product Development
  * Always maintain "signature" look
  * Release products in 3 stage quiet launch
  * All developers can work on all products
  * Strict development priorities

### Read Intro + Chapter 1

### Simple Rules

* Simple rules are simple -- just a handful (6 or less, 2-3 ideally)
* Unique to the person and situation
* Relate to a specific activity, not generalities

### Coldplay Rules

Always keep working, record everything lest it be forgotten, limit interviews.

Seems to work for them, though perhaps not sustainably. Allows focus on the music instead of things that might be distracting.

### Read Chapter 2 & 3

## 2.3 Strategy in Real Time

### Types of Rules

* Boundary - Which opportunities to pick
* Priority - Preferred opportunities (harder)
* Stopping - When to quit (hardest)
* How-to - How to proceed & what to do
* Coordination - How to work w/others
* Timing - When to proceed (harder)

### Simple Rules in Your Situation

1. Identify key strategic processes in your own situation, and pick 1 to focus on. In 2-3 sentences give us some background on the context you are working on and the strategic process you chose to focus on.

When we gather, we use unconferences as a means of surfacing latent ideas and connecting with one another. Our unconferences start with colleagues submitting topics, use voting to select topics to be discussed, and provide some rules to guide the discussion. We have carefully iterated to strong core rules, but room for improvement remains.

2. What are the simple rules of your focal strategic process (selection rules, priority rules, process rules, exit rules, etc)? Talk to a few colleagues to see which the simple rules they identify for that strategic process.

Topics are suggested by colleagues, de-duplicated by organizers, and then colleagues vote to determine the final schedule.

Within each topic, participants are asked to solicit a facilitator, notetaker, and timekeeper.

Participants are asked to participate actively, with full attention, or migrate to a different topic. They are also instructed to raise one hand to add to a topic or two hands to change topics.

Facilitators are asked to start by soliciting background and goals. They are asked to call on participants, preferring to stay on the same topic. They are also told to ask non-active participants for comments and questions. Finally, they are asked to be assertive in reiterating any broken rules.

Notetakers are told to expect not to be active participants, to capture highlights rather than the whole conversation, and to share their notes with everyone afterward.

Timekeepers are asked to watch the clock, announcing when the session is half over and when only 5 minutes remain. In the final five minutes, they are asked to direct participants to reflect, summarize the discussion, then clarify next actions and actors.

3. Now that youâ€™ve identified the simple rules, try to evaluate their effectiveness. Are there too many rules or too few? Are these the right rules or the wrong ones? Are you missing any types of rules?

I think they are pretty good overall, but there is always room to improve. Although there are a lot of rules in total, they are divided across different roles so that each individual only needs to worry about roughly 3-5, which feels manageable still. The overall flow of the event has been good, and the feedback has been quite positive, but I think we could still improve a few sub sections.

I'm not sure the facilitator has the right rules to help them draw in non-active participants yet, nor to recognize when particular voices are dominating too much. There might be value to suggesting a prioritizing rule to prefer less-active speakers, in addition to preferring existing topic continuation. Similarly, it might help to have a stopping rule relating to when a particular topic has run it's course or when a particular speaker is being too dominant and/or repetitive in their points.

Reflecting on this, it also strikes me as a bit odd for the wrap-up to fall to the timekeeper. I think I made that choice in the interest of keeping the total number of rules per role small, but it really feels like something that would make sense as a mix of things for the notetaker to ensure the record aligns with what people believe they said and heard.

## 2.4 Three Steps to Simple Rules

### Three Steps to Simple Rules

1. Determine primary objective (what you want more of or less of)
2. Find the bottleneck to achieving that objective?
3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck, sources for ideas:
  * Get expert advise, may help but probably not tailored to your context
  * Analyze your own data/history
  * Advise from friend's and peers

### Bottleneck Examples

Misc notes:

* Initial rules may be insightful, but often may target hard to get metrics. If so, may need to seek out different ways or proxies to these metrics.

### Developing Simple Rules Exercise

Boundary/Priority/Stopping/How-to/Timing

1. What is your primary objective?

Break down knowledge silos by capturing tribal knowledge, seeking and sharing perspective.

2. What is the bottleneck to achieving that objective?

Getting teams to consistently take time away from execution to record their knowledge, especially as they may not directly see the value this provides.

3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck.

Boundary:
Decisions should be recorded in detail if:
* There are stakeholders outside your team.
* It will take days or weeks to execute.
* It will be costly to reverse the decision.
Priority:
* Decisions should be recorded prior to execution and shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback.
* Prefer choices that provide clearer metrics, and which have high learning to cost ratios.
Stopping:
* Decision making and recording are distinct from planning and prioritization. If a decision is de-prioritized, it should be set aside until we agree to work on it.
* Feedback should be solicited with a deadline in order to keep things moving, and if the deadline is missed different collaborators should be sought.
How-to:
* Capture at least NABC: the (N)eed to be addressed, the (A)pproach, the (B)enefits, and the (C)ompetition/alternatives.
* Get at least one additional stakeholder to review the document to provide feedback and perspective.
* Share the final document in a shared central repository so others can find and learn from it.
Timing:
* Ask collaborators to provide feedback within 3 business days, and failing a prompt response solicit different collaborators in order to keep things moving.
* One month after a decision was made, it should be revisited to consider what we may have missed, what we learned in the mean time, and how we can make better decisions in the future.

### Feedback on Exercise

Keep your objective clear and measurable. For example, what knowledge do you hope to capture and how will you know if you did? What perspectives do you seek, how will they be shared and how will you determine if this activity was productive? Include a timeframe for you endeavor (even if ongoing) so you know when to review your solution for efficacy. As you develop your objective, it is important you consider how you will measure success (what metrics will be used)?

Time management is not a bottleneck. When you identify bottlenecks, be specific. Think of this analogy, the hiring process is a problem. What aspect of the hiring process? Does it take days to get the position posted on a job board? Does Human Resources (HR) take an inordinate amount of time to create the job description, is the vetting process to develop a short list of candidates too involved, does panel review coordination create delays, or are there other issues. As you look for bottlenecks, be specific. If time is a zero sum game, what do you want them to give up (cease doing) so they can record their knowledge?  Do they know what knowledge you want them to impart and in what order?

There should be continuity among the objective, bottleneck and solution with the later removing the bottlenecks and moving towards the objective. As you look at your solution, do you believe it will lead to your objective? As you craft your solution avoid ambiguity and interpretive language. For example, "Decisions should be recorded in detail if:...", what decisions, all decisions or are there parameters that guide which decisions should be recorded? Recorded how and under what parameters? Think of it this way, do two people tell of the same experience the same way? You want to make sure they are recording what you desire.

As you examine your solution, look at the order. For example, the "NABC" instruction appears as more of a boundary than a how to, but since the process you are recording is not clear, I may be wrong. The solution appears to be focused on "decisions", but the objective is about capturing knowledge and gaining perspective. I'm not sure how your solution will achieve this goal.

The stopping mechanism should act as a review process for your solution. Is the solution addressing some of the bottlenecks but not all,  are parts of the solution being misinterpreted, perhaps driving activity based on incorrect inputs, or other issues? The stopping mechanism you include is more priority or boundary related. The thoughts and questions are for your consideration and do not require a response, but if you do have any questions or further discussion or clarification points, feel free to contact me by submitting questions to the course forum, or by email at ask-the-professor-innovation@lists.Stanford.edu.

## 2.5 Why are Simple Rules effective?

### Why are Simple Rules Effective?

* Flexible opportunity capture - balance between enough structure and not too much bureacracy - really quickly deliver the wrong thing, or deliver not enough
* "edge of chaos" move away from predictable outcome, but sometimes you make mistakes (stopping rules help recover).

### Chaos, Structure, Improvising

* chaos - rule-breaking culture - "our culture NOT to write things down" - little structure, unclear priorities, random communication
* structure - rule-following - much structure - channeled communication
* improvising - adaptive - semi-structured - prioritized, but organization is temporary - real time communication

* faster, better decisions - sometimes better than more info & analysis - followable even when tired or stressed
* better coordination of people - easy to remember and communicate rules

### (optional) Read Chapters 4, 6, 7, 8

### Exercise 2.4: Real Time Metrics

#### 1

Grade your real-time information by answering the following questions:

    What were your sales last week?
    What is the time it takes to get from concept to launch?
    What is your biggest rivalâ€™s top customer?
    What is your highest margin product?

Feel free to adjust the questions as needed to make them right for your context. Try to make sure the questions still focus on what is happening now in your organization, time, your outside environment, and being effective. Talk to four colleagues, and see how they answer these questions.

Now, please share your answers with us:

What were your answers to the four questions? What grade did you give yourself? What grade did you give your colleagues?

As I work internally with team process, the questions seem off. Also, it's pretty apparent to me that I do not have ready access to these answers (and others don't either). In this context we are all getting Fs. Some possible, better questions (which we still can't answer well):

How many people used the internal tool last week?
How long does it take to complete the internal process?
What is the biggest remaining pain point?
What is the most valuable current process point?

At best we have anecdotal evidence around these questions, and tend so far not to agree on the answers.

#### 2

What did you learn from asking yourself and your colleagues these questions?

It became clear to me that we need to get a clearer definition of what our goals are, or perhaps which needles we hope to move in the terms this course has used. Lacking that, it is not possible to really dig into which metrics we should track, let alone how to move them. I've initiated that discussion with other leaders and have worked through the first few iterations of what our prioritized goals might be.

#### 3

What would you like to change or do differently based on what you've learned?

I want to ensure that moving forward we are clearer about our goals and have a shared agreement about how we will prioritize and/or judge changes to process. Additionally, I want to make a much more concerted effort around objective metrics to help gauge our progress. In the earlier phases of these projects, I was the only one directly working on them. It was easy to fool myself into thinking that I had a clearer understanding of the goals than I really did, perhaps falling victim to the illusion of explanatory depth. I think by being more clear and explicit about this, and driving a discussion more broadly about it we should have a better foundation to rebuild the processes upon.

# Module 3: Strategy for Tomorrow

## 3.1 The Genetics of Change

### Best Practices for Regenerating Short-Term Strategy

* genetic evolution
* inverse power law: lots of small changes, some medium changes, occasional large changes
* mix old/traditional and new
* get to the future sooner, cheaper, and with less risk by leveraging the past (not everything has to be green field)

### Exercise 3.1: Read Growth Outside the Core

Most sustained, profitable growth comes when pushing out boundaries of core business into adjacent space.

How to succeed in expanding into adjacent markets through simple rules.

* Never put core business at risk.
* Make adjacency move only if you expect to end up among the top three players in the new space.
* Pursue one opportunity at a time.
* Change one variable at a time.

How to grow into adjacent spaces

* expand along value chain (one of the most difficult options)
* grow new products and services
* use new distribution channels
* enter new geographies
* address new customer segments, often by modifying proven product or technology
* move into the "white space" with a new business unit built around a strong capability (rarest and most difficult)

Benefits to be gained from disciplined use of a formula

* learning-curve - allows refinement of skills and systematization of processes
* reduced complexity by changing only one thing at a time - allows more consistency/repeatability
* speed - allows moving through process faster due to refinements/systematization/etc
* strategic clarity - repeatability is compelling and easy to understand

Sources of Repeatability

* Segmenting Customers - understand needs of customers
* Growing Share of Wallet - sell related stuff to existing customers
* Mirroring Customer Adjacencies - track customer plans and anticipate their needs

### Exercise 3.2: Read Focus on the Middle Term

Time horizons:

* Horizon 3 (ideas for future businesses)
* Horizon 2 (young businesses)
* Horizon 1 (established businesses)

Ways to ensure Horizon 3 survive and live on:

* avoid holding Horizon 2 businesses to Horizon 1 standards
* accept that Horizon 2 businesses will pay off in the medium term, not immediately
* safeguard Horizon 2 resources, so that nascent projects can mature to adulthood

How to manage Horizon 2 Projects:

* Insulate Horizon 2 from Horizon 1 to ensure young businesses get and keep needed resources
* Use acquisitions to help fill any Horizon 2 vacuum
* Establish different norms - Horizon 1 focuses on profitably underwriting operations of a large established business, Horizon 2 needs to focus on attracting customers and/or dominating a niche. Look to metrics like customer-acquisition velocity and fish-to-pond ratio.
* Assign best leaders to Horizon 2 projects - measure success by growth from timely and effective entry into hot market category, and find leaders who can grow to where existing operations can take over
* Block cross-horizon resource migration - after deciding a budget and leaders, stick to it. Don't allow hoarding or poaching from Horizon 1.

"To a veteran Horizon 1 manager, any shared resource is subject to pillaging."

### Exercise 3.3: Applying the Gene Sequence to Your Own Context

1. Try to describe the gene sequence of your situation (product, customer, technology, etc.). Feel free to provide the gene template provided in the course slides and below.
[ cloud-based web hosting, SMB/startup developers, direct online sales, us]
2. Pick one gene and describe what it would look like if you changed that gene. In other words, what could you change that gene to?
Adding additional geographical regions could gain us new customers, as existing latency, data residency, and other issues prevent current usage. We would have challenges, however, in terms of duplicating our platform in the region, hiring support personel in corresponding time zones, etc.
3. Do the same exercise again, but this time try to describe what it would look like if you made a bigger change, and modified 2-3 genes in your gene sequence at once.
Moving to sell to CTOs/enterprise developers represents a bigger shift that would require other changes as well. For instance, moving toward invoices/contracts over credit-card payment, supporting more auditing capabilities, demonstrating particular compliances, etc.
4. Identify some barriers to change and to implementing some of your gene change ideas for short-term growth.
Because we would have to recreate our infrastructure and team to support additional regions, it is costly and slower than we might like. By investing in doing this, we could likely gain velocity with each iteration, but we should make sure there is enough capturable value there to make it worth it. Moving to CTOs/enterprise represents a larger risk, as the existing product may be insufficient and the work that needs doing may distract us from supporting the core.

# Module 4: Strategy for the Next Day

## 4.1 Probing

* Probe the future using a wide variety of low-cost probes.
* Manage number of probes, not just types. More probes and variety in response to more uncertainty.
* Follow identity of company, not vision of industry.

## 4.2 Probing in Practice

* Constant thin attention to the future with a variety of low cost probes. (vs reactionary or episodic planning)

## Exercise 4.1: Examining Probing Strategies at Dropbox

1. Think about Dropboxâ€™s value chain, and try to identify the important uncertainties Dropbox entrepreneurs were facing when they were getting started.
How was it different from the crowded space of other online backup/storage solutions. Would a single solution serve both consumers and business users? Would freemium work for growth and drive to conversion? How costly would various advertising strategies be for acquisition? What new features should be focused on/pursued? How to structure the site, referral program, etc in order to drive the most conversions.
2. What probes (if any) did Dropbox entrepreneurs use to learn about these uncertainties?
Posting a screencast to hacker news of an early demo to get feedback. Private beta program for a limited group of users registered through a simple landing page. Digg video to generate interest and drive beta signups. Tried a variety of marketing/ad techniques to discover cost per paying customer. A/B testing page layouts to drive AARRR acquisition/startup metrics. Sought distribution deals (ultimately failing, lacking own strong brand). Votebox to find feature requests. Usability testing.
3. Rate the effectiveness of their probing strategy (how cheap were the probes? How quick were the probes? How well did they address the uncertainty involved? Did they use hypotheses? How varied were the probes?). How helpful was their probing strategy in allowing Dropbox to learn what they needed in order to move ahead.
Good at a few things, but had blindspots (especially around heavily engineer-centric early culture). Overall the probes seemed to be effective in helping them rule out a number of options and settle on things that worked. That said, by not bringing in marketing/business talent, it seems like they may have been missing some additional probes/angles that might have been valuable.

### Key Points from Dropbox Probing Strategy

* variety of probes (features, operational effectiveness, customer acquisition, ease of use)
* analytics as complement to probes
* clear/strong business identity - "it just works" (not an industry vision)

## Exercise 4.2: Examining Probing Strategies at Cake Financial

1. Think about Cake Financialâ€™s value chain, and try to identify the important uncertainties Cake Finacial entrepreneurs were facing when they were getting started.
There were uncertainties about product market fit, and monetization strategy.
2. What probes (if any) did Cake Financial entrepreneurs use to learn about these uncertainties?
Forecasting and market analysis. Focus groups. Began with focus on real development/integration to other systems, one of the hardest parts and something that is furthest removed from new customer value. TechCrunch 40. Hiring PM, personas, surveys.
3. Rate the effectiveness of their probing strategy (how cheap were the probes? How quick were the probes? How well did they address the uncertainty involved? Did they use hypotheses? How varied were the probes?). How helpful was their probing strategy in allowing Dropbox to learn what they needed in order to move ahead.
The probes seemed costly, and focused on the needs of the founders/investors rather than potential customers. TechCrunch40 prevented a beta, which seems dangerous/costly. So focused on initial vision, that when changing direction, they were forced to change personel also. Personas, surveys are much better value to cost, but probably too little too late.
4. After assessing Cake Financialâ€™s probing strategy, compare it to the probing strategy used by Dropbox. What are the similarities and differences in their probing strategies?
Cake invested a lot up front, based on market research and assumptions of customer behavior/desire that were misguided. Additionally, they focused almost wholly on what it did behind the scenes, and gave very little focus to how it felt for users. Overall Cake made fewer, bigger bets, with less info.
5. Which of the two is more effective? Why?
The Dropbox approach seems much more effective. Focusing on specifically what users want and need, and undertaking small related experiments to continually iterate toward this clear identity/vision is much safer than making a few large bets about where an industry might be headed.

## 4.4 The Effectiveness of Probing

Be wary of always using the same probes.

Probes should learn about uncertainties, from low investments, and have temporary life. Avoid conflating with business. Business should drive financial performance, involve substantial investment, and have permanent life.

### Why is Probing Effective

* You learn through small losses (big losses lead to defensiveness, wins are seen as foregone conclusions).
* People learn in different ways, use lots of types of probes to get a clearer, fuller picture.
* Hypotheses clarify what you want to learn, and by being more explicit it is more likely you will reveal errors which can be learned from (whereas these might get lost in a weak/loose hypothesis).

## 4.5 Probing Screens

Define probe, cost, and time. Evaluate probe screen/strategy effectiveness (uncertainty addressed, cost, variety, hypotheses)

### Probing Key Points

* Wide variety (time and type)
* Low cost, so you can learn more (high cost leads to defensiveness)
* Hypotheses
* Identity, not Vision
* About learning, not business
* More uncertainty, more probes

### Exercise 4.3 Applying Probing to Your Situation

1. Create a probe screen for your situation with 3 time horizons. Pick the 3 time horizons that make the most sense for your situation/industry.
Currently I think 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years are good timelines for us to consider.
2. Think about how you currently probe (aka experiment) in your situation. Arrange the probes around the circles of the probe screen youâ€™ve created. Then, draw arrows to the relevant time horizon.
  * In the 6-12 month range, we plan to revamp the decision process with the intention of spreading knowledge, improving decision making, and increasing transparency.
  * In the 1 year range, we plan to develop tools for long range planning, so that we can continue to reduce uncertainties and begin investing in the bigger, harder things over time.
  * On the 2 year range, we plan to share/adapt our tools to work for the customer base of the broader organization. This will increase our impact, bring greater alignment between our division and the broader organization, and (hopefully) drive improvements in the broader organization as well.
3. Verify the probe screen youâ€™ve created with 4 colleagues. Tell us about any interesting insights you gained from the discussion with your colleagues.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the probe screen used in your situation. Think of the uncertainty addressed, cost, variety, use of hypotheses.
  * Interviews helps focus upcoming efforts and collect feedback. It is somewhat time consuming to do however, and can be victim to over-fitting/anecdote. They also tend to be freeform, which means the quality/consistency of feedback is variable and would likely be improved by clear hypothesis.
  * The long range planning tools seek to highlight bigger problems that we need to start chipping away at and provide insight into how we can get started. Providing these tools and documentation should be relatively inexpensive, though driving adoption may be. Additionally, we should ensure we understand the needs/desires of individuals before pushing too far on this.
  * Integrating into the broader organization can be challenging due to cultural differences, lack of existing relationships, etc. But it has proven to be valuable for them, as well as giving us new perspectives on our own efforts.
5. What would you do differently, add or change, in the probing strategy you currently use?
  * We could probably get better feedback by making it a part of the process and reusing questions to see how things move over time.
  * We should seek to understand the needs of individuals, as well as the broader organization, in considering long term strategy. How can we find things that will be successful in serving both and that can effectively lead to action. I suspect that we may want a focus on something more like this probing strategy, which has a focus on where the major uncertainties are and how to reduce them over time rather than a particular set of solutions on offer.
  * Integrating to the broader organization has been productive, but we need to take care that it doesn't draw too much energy and attention away from local efforts. If we aren't able to get those sorted out successfully, we won't have anything to adapt/share when the time comes. So we should continue to engage, but also keep an eye on the amount of resources it is taking and ensure it stays proportional.

# Module 5: Moving Through Time

## 5.1 Time Pacing

* Time Pacing
  * Scan relevant rhythms
  * Structure/coreograph transitions
  * Set the pace
* Rhythm, NOT Speed
* As opposed to event pacing, which is pacing defined in response to external events

## Exercise 5.1: Applying Time Pacing to Your Situation

1. Fill out a time pacing diamond for your situation. Identify rhythms of your buyers, complementors, suppliers, competitors, and yourself and list them on the time pacing diamond.
* We rely on a biannual employee survey to help understand how effective some programs are.
* We push to change the practices and process for teams, which are working from a quarterly planning cycle.
* We push for changes to the broader vision and goals, which are generally set annually.
* We work on improving our long range planning, which updates annually in preperation for annual budgeting.
* We have biweekly discussion meetings and a monthly newsletter that we want to have things to share in.
2. Identify opportunities to exploit rhythms of others and/or to set the pace yourself. What are they?
We could structure rollout of programs to better coincide with lulls in the planning cycle and/or such that they would be adopted as a new cycle begins. Similarly, we could work to structure other initiatives to align with annual things so that they have the greatest impact. Overall, I think we could do well to set a clearer, more regular release schedule for changes so that others will be able to prepare for them, instead of releasing things as they become ready (as we did in the past, which attempts to force others into event-pacing, often without much success).
3. What are some barriers you can find to being in rhythm?
Culturally we tend to ship things on an ASAP basis, which may actually be too fast. Pushing back to try and ship the right things, at the right time may be challenging. In a related fashion, we want to develop changes iteratively, and this can be very difficult if the feedback cycle is defined by a long time cycle due to outside factors. Having not been careful and explicit about pacing, we often have been less successful by (in effect) trying to force others to respond to our events instead of inviting them to join our rhythm.

## 5.2 Transitions

* Faster rhythms raise importance of transitions
* Often arbitrary
* Strict choreography saves time and confusion

## 5.3 The Effectiveness of Time Pacing

* Avoid natural tendency to delay and/or change too little
* Allows for time to reflect/introspect
* Synchronize a complex task. Utilize fastest constant speed, rather than fastest speed with variability.
* People learn to pace themselves
* Create focus that is motivating and confidence-inspiring

## 5.4 Reflecting

* Real-time Strategy
  * Simple Rules
  * Metrics
* Short-term Strategy
  * Gene Sequence
  * Balancing Old & New
* Long-term Strategy
  * Probing
  * Time Pacing
  * Transitions, Rhythm
