Simple Rules for Strategy Driven Innovation

# Module 1: Course Overview

# Module 2: Strategy in Real Time

## 2.1 Introducing Strategy

Strategy as structured chaos.

* More uncertain environments should have simpler strategies
* Time is central to strategy, with longer time horizons, a focus on rhythm over speed, and attention to time-related metrics
* organization drives strategy

* video game strategy - play the game and strategy becomes apparent
* velcro organization - known/knowable current state (ie open vs closed) and quick to change

## 2.2 Strategy as Simple Rules

### Best Practices

* Focus on bottleneck strategic process and a few simple rules.
* Success is driven by more information, not less
* Business unit teams are central to success
* Innovation AND efficiency

### Simple Rules Examples

* Big Pharma - R&D
  * clear ranking of molecule types as research priorities
  * maximum number of types pursued at one time
  * projects "killed" according to step charts
* Internet Venture - Product Development
  * Always maintain "signature" look
  * Release products in 3 stage quiet launch
  * All developers can work on all products
  * Strict development priorities

### Read Intro + Chapter 1

### Simple Rules

* Simple rules are simple -- just a handful (6 or less, 2-3 ideally)
* Unique to the person and situation
* Relate to a specific activity, not generalities

### Coldplay Rules

Always keep working, record everything lest it be forgotten, limit interviews.

Seems to work for them, though perhaps not sustainably. Allows focus on the music instead of things that might be distracting.

### Read Chapter 2 & 3

## 2.3 Strategy in Real Time

### Types of Rules

* Boundary - Which opportunities to pick
* Priority - Preferred opportunities (harder)
* Stopping - When to quit (hardest)
* How-to - How to proceed & what to do
* Coordination - How to work w/others
* Timing - When to proceed (harder)

### Simple Rules in Your Situation

1. Identify key strategic processes in your own situation, and pick 1 to focus on. In 2-3 sentences give us some background on the context you are working on and the strategic process you chose to focus on.

When we gather, we use unconferences as a means of surfacing latent ideas and connecting with one another. Our unconferences start with colleagues submitting topics, use voting to select topics to be discussed, and provide some rules to guide the discussion. We have carefully iterated to strong core rules, but room for improvement remains.

2. What are the simple rules of your focal strategic process (selection rules, priority rules, process rules, exit rules, etc)? Talk to a few colleagues to see which the simple rules they identify for that strategic process.

Topics are suggested by colleagues, de-duplicated by organizers, and then colleagues vote to determine the final schedule.

Within each topic, participants are asked to solicit a facilitator, notetaker, and timekeeper.

Participants are asked to participate actively, with full attention, or migrate to a different topic. They are also instructed to raise one hand to add to a topic or two hands to change topics.

Facilitators are asked to start by soliciting background and goals. They are asked to call on participants, preferring to stay on the same topic. They are also told to ask non-active participants for comments and questions. Finally, they are asked to be assertive in reiterating any broken rules.

Notetakers are told to expect not to be active participants, to capture highlights rather than the whole conversation, and to share their notes with everyone afterward.

Timekeepers are asked to watch the clock, announcing when the session is half over and when only 5 minutes remain. In the final five minutes, they are asked to direct participants to reflect, summarize the discussion, then clarify next actions and actors.

3. Now that you’ve identified the simple rules, try to evaluate their effectiveness. Are there too many rules or too few? Are these the right rules or the wrong ones? Are you missing any types of rules?

I think they are pretty good overall, but there is always room to improve. Although there are a lot of rules in total, they are divided across different roles so that each individual only needs to worry about roughly 3-5, which feels manageable still. The overall flow of the event has been good, and the feedback has been quite positive, but I think we could still improve a few sub sections.

I'm not sure the facilitator has the right rules to help them draw in non-active participants yet, nor to recognize when particular voices are dominating too much. There might be value to suggesting a prioritizing rule to prefer less-active speakers, in addition to preferring existing topic continuation. Similarly, it might help to have a stopping rule relating to when a particular topic has run it's course or when a particular speaker is being too dominant and/or repetitive in their points.

Reflecting on this, it also strikes me as a bit odd for the wrap-up to fall to the timekeeper. I think I made that choice in the interest of keeping the total number of rules per role small, but it really feels like something that would make sense as a mix of things for the notetaker to ensure the record aligns with what people believe they said and heard.

## 2.4 Three Steps to Simple Rules

### Three Steps to Simple Rules

1. Determine primary objective (what you want more of or less of)
2. Find the bottleneck to achieving that objective?
3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck, sources for ideas:
  * Get expert advise, may help but probably not tailored to your context
  * Analyze your own data/history
  * Advise from friend's and peers

### Bottleneck Examples

Misc notes:

* Initial rules may be insightful, but often may target hard to get metrics. If so, may need to seek out different ways or proxies to these metrics.

### Developing Simple Rules Exercise

Boundary/Priority/Stopping/How-to/Timing

1. What is your primary objective?

Break down knowledge silos by capturing tribal knowledge, seeking and sharing perspective.

2. What is the bottleneck to achieving that objective?

Getting teams to consistently take time away from execution to record their knowledge, especially as they may not directly see the value this provides.

3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck.

Boundary:
Decisions should be recorded in detail if:
* There are stakeholders outside your team.
* It will take days or weeks to execute.
* It will be costly to reverse the decision.
Priority:
* Decisions should be recorded prior to execution and shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback.
* Prefer choices that provide clearer metrics, and which have high learning to cost ratios.
Stopping:
* Decision making and recording are distinct from planning and prioritization. If a decision is de-prioritized, it should be set aside until we agree to work on it.
* Feedback should be solicited with a deadline in order to keep things moving, and if the deadline is missed different collaborators should be sought.
How-to:
* Capture at least NABC: the (N)eed to be addressed, the (A)pproach, the (B)enefits, and the (C)ompetition/alternatives.
* Get at least one additional stakeholder to review the document to provide feedback and perspective.
* Share the final document in a shared central repository so others can find and learn from it.
Timing:
* Ask collaborators to provide feedback within 3 business days, and failing a prompt response solicit different collaborators in order to keep things moving.
* One month after a decision was made, it should be revisited to consider what we may have missed, what we learned in the mean time, and how we can make better decisions in the future.

### Feedback on Exercise

Keep your objective clear and measurable. For example, what knowledge do you hope to capture and how will you know if you did? What perspectives do you seek, how will they be shared and how will you determine if this activity was productive? Include a timeframe for you endeavor (even if ongoing) so you know when to review your solution for efficacy. As you develop your objective, it is important you consider how you will measure success (what metrics will be used)?

Time management is not a bottleneck. When you identify bottlenecks, be specific. Think of this analogy, the hiring process is a problem. What aspect of the hiring process? Does it take days to get the position posted on a job board? Does Human Resources (HR) take an inordinate amount of time to create the job description, is the vetting process to develop a short list of candidates too involved, does panel review coordination create delays, or are there other issues. As you look for bottlenecks, be specific. If time is a zero sum game, what do you want them to give up (cease doing) so they can record their knowledge?  Do they know what knowledge you want them to impart and in what order?

There should be continuity among the objective, bottleneck and solution with the later removing the bottlenecks and moving towards the objective. As you look at your solution, do you believe it will lead to your objective? As you craft your solution avoid ambiguity and interpretive language. For example, "Decisions should be recorded in detail if:...", what decisions, all decisions or are there parameters that guide which decisions should be recorded? Recorded how and under what parameters? Think of it this way, do two people tell of the same experience the same way? You want to make sure they are recording what you desire.

As you examine your solution, look at the order. For example, the "NABC" instruction appears as more of a boundary than a how to, but since the process you are recording is not clear, I may be wrong. The solution appears to be focused on "decisions", but the objective is about capturing knowledge and gaining perspective. I'm not sure how your solution will achieve this goal.

The stopping mechanism should act as a review process for your solution. Is the solution addressing some of the bottlenecks but not all,  are parts of the solution being misinterpreted, perhaps driving activity based on incorrect inputs, or other issues? The stopping mechanism you include is more priority or boundary related. The thoughts and questions are for your consideration and do not require a response, but if you do have any questions or further discussion or clarification points, feel free to contact me by submitting questions to the course forum, or by email at ask-the-professor-innovation@lists.Stanford.edu.

## 2.5 Why are Simple Rules effective?

### Why are Simple Rules Effective?

* Flexible opportunity capture - balance between enough structure and not too much bureacracy - really quickly deliver the wrong thing, or deliver not enough
* "edge of chaos" move away from predictable outcome, but sometimes you make mistakes (stopping rules help recover).

### Chaos, Structure, Improvising

* chaos - rule-breaking culture - "our culture NOT to write things down" - little structure, unclear priorities, random communication
* structure - rule-following - much structure - channeled communication
* improvising - adaptive - semi-structured - prioritized, but organization is temporary - real time communication

* faster, better decisions - sometimes better than more info & analysis - followable even when tired or stressed
* better coordination of people - easy to remember and communicate rules

### Exercise 2.4: Real Time Metrics

#### 1

Grade your real-time information by answering the following questions:

    What were your sales last week?
    What is the time it takes to get from concept to launch?
    What is your biggest rival’s top customer?
    What is your highest margin product?

Feel free to adjust the questions as needed to make them right for your context. Try to make sure the questions still focus on what is happening now in your organization, time, your outside environment, and being effective. Talk to four colleagues, and see how they answer these questions.

Now, please share your answers with us:

What were your answers to the four questions? What grade did you give yourself? What grade did you give your colleagues?

As I work internally with team process, the questions seem off. Also, it's pretty apparent to me that I do not have ready access to these answers (and others don't either). In this context we are all getting Fs. Some possible, better questions (which we still can't answer well):

How many people used the internal tool last week?
How long does it take to complete the internal process?
What is the biggest remaining pain point?
What is the most valuable current process point?

At best we have anecdotal evidence around these questions, and tend so far not to agree on the answers.

#### 2

What did you learn from asking yourself and your colleagues these questions?

It became clear to me that we need to get a clearer definition of what our goals are, or perhaps which needles we hope to move in the terms this course has used. Lacking that, it is not possible to really dig into which metrics we should track, let alone how to move them. I've initiated that discussion with other leaders and have worked through the first few iterations of what our prioritized goals might be.

#### 3

What would you like to change or do differently based on what you've learned?

I want to ensure that moving forward we are clearer about our goals and have a shared agreement about how we will prioritize and/or judge changes to process. Additionally, I want to make a much more concerted effort around objective metrics to help gauge our progress. In the earlier phases of these projects, I was the only one directly working on them. It was easy to fool myself into thinking that I had a clearer understanding of the goals than I really did, perhaps falling victim to the illusion of explanatory depth. I think by being more clear and explicit about this, and driving a discussion more broadly about it we should have a better foundation to rebuild the processes upon.

# Module 3: Strategy for Tomorrow

## 3.1 The Genetics of Change

### Best Practices for Regenerating Short-Term Strategy

* genetic evolution
* inverse power law: lots of small changes, some medium changes, occasional large changes
* mix old/traditional and new
* get to the future sooner, cheaper, and with less risk by leveraging the past (not everything has to be green field)

### Exercise 3.1: Read Growth Outside the Core

Most sustained, profitable growth comes when pushing out boundaries of core business into adjacent space.

How to succeed in expanding into adjacent markets through simple rules.

* Never put core business at risk.
* Make adjacency move only if you expect to end up among the top three players in the new space.
* Pursue one opportunity at a time.
* Change one variable at a time.

How to grow into adjacent spaces

* expand along value chain (one of the most difficult options)
* grow new products and services
* use new distribution channels
* enter new geographies
* address new customer segments, often by modifying proven product or technology
* move into the "white space" with a new business unit built around a strong capability (rarest and most difficult)

Benefits to be gained from disciplined use of a formula

* learning-curve - allows refinement of skills and systematization of processes
* reduced complexity by changing only one thing at a time - allows more consistency/repeatability
* speed - allows moving through process faster due to refinements/systematization/etc
* strategic clarity - repeatability is compelling and easy to understand

Sources of Repeatability

* Segmenting Customers - understand needs of customers
* Growing Share of Wallet - sell related stuff to existing customers
* Mirroring Customer Adjacencies - track customer plans and anticipate their needs

### Exercise 3.2: Read Focus on the Middle Term

Time horizons:

* Horizon 3 (ideas for future businesses)
* Horizon 2 (young businesses)
* Horizon 1 (established businesses)

Ways to ensure Horizon 3 survive and live on:

* avoid holding Horizon 2 businesses to Horizon 1 standards
* accept that Horizon 2 businesses will pay off in the medium term, not immediately
* safeguard Horizon 2 resources, so that nascent projects can mature to adulthood

How to manage Horizon 2 Projects:

* Insulate Horizon 2 from Horizon 1 to ensure young businesses get and keep needed resources
* Use acquisitions to help fill any Horizon 2 vacuum
* Establish different norms - Horizon 1 focuses on profitably underwriting operations of a large established business, Horizon 2 needs to focus on attracting customers and/or dominating a niche. Look to metrics like customer-acquisition velocity and fish-to-pond ratio.
* Assign best leaders to Horizon 2 projects - measure success by growth from timely and effective entry into hot market category, and find leaders who can grow to where existing operations can take over
* Block cross-horizon resource migration - after deciding a budget and leaders, stick to it. Don't allow hoarding or poaching from Horizon 1.

"To a veteran Horizon 1 manager, any shared resource is subject to pillaging."

### Exercise 3.3: Applying the Gene Sequence to Your Own Context

1. Try to describe the gene sequence of your situation (product, customer, technology, etc.). Feel free to provide the gene template provided in the course slides and below.
[ cloud-based web hosting, SMB/startup developers, direct online sales, us]
2. Pick one gene and describe what it would look like if you changed that gene. In other words, what could you change that gene to?
Adding additional geographical regions could gain us new customers, as existing latency, data residency, and other issues prevent current usage. We would have challenges, however, in terms of duplicating our platform in the region, hiring support personel in corresponding time zones, etc.
3. Do the same exercise again, but this time try to describe what it would look like if you made a bigger change, and modified 2-3 genes in your gene sequence at once.
Moving to sell to CTOs/enterprise developers represents a bigger shift that would require other changes as well. For instance, moving toward invoices/contracts over credit-card payment, supporting more auditing capabilities, demonstrating particular compliances, etc.
4. Identify some barriers to change and to implementing some of your gene change ideas for short-term growth.
Because we would have to recreate our infrastructure and team to support additional regions, it is costly and slower than we might like. By investing in doing this, we could likely gain velocity with each iteration, but we should make sure there is enough capturable value there to make it worth it. Moving to CTOs/enterprise represents a larger risk, as the existing product may be insufficient and the work that needs doing may distract us from supporting the core.
