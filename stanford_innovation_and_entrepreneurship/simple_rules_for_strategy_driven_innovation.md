# Real Time Strategy

## Simple Rules

More uncertain environments are better served by simpler strategies.

### Simple Rule Features

* Simple rules are simple -- just a handful (6 or less, 2-3 ideally)
* Unique to the person and situation
* Relate to a specific activity, not generalities

### Simple Rule Types

* Boundary - Which opportunities to pick
* Priority - Preferred opportunities (harder)
* Stopping - When to quit (hardest)
* How-to - How to proceed & what to do
* Coordination - How to work w/others
* Timing - When to proceed (harder)

### Creating Simple Rules
1. Determine primary objective (what you want more of or less of)
2. Find the bottleneck to achieving that objective?
3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck, sources for ideas:
  * Get expert advise, may help but probably not tailored to your context
  * Analyze your own data/history
  * Advise from friend's and peers

# Short-term Strategy

## Gene Sequence

Drive sustained, profitable growth by expanding from core business.

### Gene Sequence Practices

* genetic evolution
* inverse power law: lots of small changes, some medium changes, occasional large changes
* mix old/traditional and new
* get to the future sooner, cheaper, and with less risk by leveraging the past (not everything has to be green field)

### Successful Expansion Through Simple Rules

* Never put core business at risk.
* Make adjacency move only if you expect to end up among the top three players in the new space.
* Pursue one opportunity at a time.
* Change one variable at a time.

### How to Grow into Adjacencies

* expand along value chain (one of the most difficult options)
* grow new products and services
* use new distribution channels
* enter new geographies
* address new customer segments, often by modifying proven product or technology
* move into the "white space" with a new business unit built around a strong capability (rarest and most difficult)

### Benefits of Repeatable Formula

* learning-curve - allows refinement of skills and systematization of processes
* reduced complexity by changing only one thing at a time - allows more consistency/repeatability
* speed - allows moving through process faster due to refinements/systematization/etc
* strategic clarity - repeatability is compelling and easy to understand

### Sources of Repeatability

* Segmenting Customers - understand needs of customers
* Growing Share of Wallet - sell related stuff to existing customers
* Mirroring Customer Adjacencies - track customer plans and anticipate their needs

# Long-term Strategy

## Probing

### Probing Best Practices

* Probe the future using a wide variety of low-cost probes.
* Manage number of probes, not just types. More probes and variety in response to more uncertainty.
* Follow identity of company, not vision of industry.
* Clear hypotheses to make goals explicit and improve over time.
* Constant thin attention to the future, not just reactionary or episodic planning.
* Focus on learning from temporary efforts, not delivering permanent business value.

### Why Probing is Effective

* You learn through small losses (big losses lead to defensiveness, wins are seen as foregone conclusions).
* People learn in different ways, use lots of types of probes to get a clearer, fuller picture.
* Hypotheses clarify what you want to learn, and by being more explicit it is more likely you will reveal errors which can be learned from (whereas these might get lost in a weak/loose hypothesis).

## Time Pacing

### Time Pacing Best Practices

* Avoid natural tendency to delay and/or change too little
* Allows for time to reflect/introspect
* Synchronize a complex task. Utilize fastest constant speed, rather than fastest speed with variability.
* People learn to pace themselves
* Create focus that is motivating and confidence-inspiring

### How to Time Pace

* Look for existing rhythms to exploit
* Set the pace/rhythm, if possible
* Structure/choreograph transitions
