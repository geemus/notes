# Scaling Excellence: How You Can Help Make it Happen

* Excellence: doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking!
* Rolling out scaling efforts is a slowly but surely effort requiring patience and grit.
* Scaling often involves slowing down to invest and setup for speed later.
* Scaling requires subtraction, as well as addition.
* Focus on spreading mindset, not just footprint.

## Influence Mindset

* Pen: Write a rule. Use sparingly, focus on big picture and first principles.
* Price Tag: Add cost or subsidy. Best for channeling, sorting, and managing.
* Flashlight: Apply transparency and focus to outliers

## Manage Clusterfugs

* Need to understand how the organization works, as well as how it is to work for you.
* Need to distinguish between where it's ok to fail (so you should speed up), vs where you need to get it right (so you should slow down).
* Key Causes of Clusterfugs:
  * Illusion: Mistaken assumptions on the part of decision makers.
  * Impatience: Wanting to do it quicker and faster.
  * Incompetence: The people involved are not the right ones.

## Buddhism vs Catholicism

* Catholic establishes a centralized standard and tries to replicate it exactly to local.
* Buddhist sets forth a few non-negotiables and leaves the rest to local decision makers.
* Avoid replication traps caused by delusions of uniqueness.

## Scaling Principle: Link Hot Causes to Cool Solutions

* Name either the problem, or the enemy, then tell a story.
  * If you face a real threat, focus on that. Don't construct a threat otherwise.
  * If you have a choice, focus on the style of the top managers and DNA of the organization.
* Rational arguments are often insufficient, focus on eliciting emotion and moving from weak to strong to elicit response/action.
  * Weak Negative Emotional State - Resignation Zone
  * Weak Positive Emotional State - Comfort Zone
  * Strong Negative Emotional State - Aggression Zone - Kill the Dragon, Anger
  * Strong Positive Emotional State - Passion Zone - Win the Princess, Pride

## Scaling Principle: Cut Cognitive Load

* Willpower is finite, cut out uses of it that are not valuable.
* In addition to adding things, keep an eye out for areas where you can subtract.
* Reducing load creates good will. Get rid of meetings, sunset reports, simplify approvals, etc.
* Dropbox example: dropped all non-client meetings, no new recurring allowed for 2 weeks, permission to ask to leave meetings, etc

## Scaling Principle: Increase Felt Accountability

* Felt Accountability - The places owns me, but I own the place too. Dual pulls of obligation and commitment.
* Find mission-driven focus to help prioritize and drive decision making.
* Hiring/Firing is an important tool for this.
  * Hire people who are already accountable.
  * Use other organizations as recruiting pools.
  * Create seed organizations.
  * Get poor performers out.
  * Subdivide into smaller sub units.
* Hire people who match the mindset (what is sacred, what is taboo), then guide them to behaviors that reinforce and demonstrate their beliefs.
* After promotion/advancement, it hurts the company (and the individual) if they go on doing their old job.
* Incentives can help, but they should be used cautiously and are most effective when accompanied with high emotional states.
* Focus more on killing ideas, than creating them.

## Scaling Principle: Connect and Cascade

* To spread excellence, you need to have excellence to spread.
* Lack of connections leads to ignorance, which rapidly increases propensity to make mistakes.
* Focus on cascading excellence:
  * One on one (ie mentoring)
  * One to Many (ie coaching, particularly of other coaches)
  * Many to Few (ie Navy Seals, many connections between small teams)
  * Many to Many (ie Intuit Design for Delight: Pain Storm, Solution Jam, Code Jam)
* Use all five senses, where possible, to subtly prime effort.
  * Harness metaphors - ie much different results when describing crime as a beast vs crime as a virus
  * Prime automatic effort through pictures - ie library pictures cause people to talk more softly
  * Signage/Space as cues - design space and signs to call attention to key things.
* Publishing everything can attract (and create) talent.

## Scaling Principle: Bad is Stronger Than Good

* Negativity bias: bad interactions have abotu 5x the impact and memorability of good interactions.
* Emphasize ongoing interactions, always looking for further opportunities.
* As you grow, big challenges are communication, common knowledge, and decision making.
* Give ground grudgingly. Specialization, heirarchy, and process complicate things but can prevent descent into chaos.
* Organizational design provides communication architecture. Basic steps:
  * Figure out what needs communicated.
  * Figure out what needs decided, and how to maximize number of decisions in each managers domain
  * Prioritize the most important communication and decision paths.
  * Decide who will run each group (focus on the communicators, not the managers)
  * Identify what remains unoptimized, and consider how you might address them if/when they need it.
* Process replaces ad-hoc, point-to-point communication with a bus.
  * Should scale to match the needs of the challenge it facilitates.
  * Should help ensure communication happens, and that it's quality is high.
  * Should be designed by those already doing the work.
  * Focus on output first, build in accountability, and figure out how to know if you are getting what you want at each step.

## Premortems

* Framing an outcome as certain focuses thinking and allows unmentioned (and unmentionable) things to be discussed.
* Provides opportunity to organize doubt while also building confidence.
* Process:
  * Divide into groups (each with fewer than 10 people)
  * Have half of the groups imagine the initiative failed, and the other half imagine it succeeded.
  * Each group should write a 1 page story of the chain of events leading to the failure. (1 page provides constraint to focus on what they care about most and/or what they know about most)
  * Poll all the post-mortems for failure together into a comprehensive flowchart, and do the same for success.
  * Share the flowcharts with the people who will implement, break into groups (each with fewer than 10 members) and have each focus on picking one thing they will stop doing.

## Parting Thoughts

* Things often seem chaotic and challenging in the present, success is frequently only seen after it is over.
* Time shifting can help us break away from the present chaos/anxiety:
  * Acknowledge the situation, but point to the past when people worked together and succeeded.
  * Paint a picture of how great the future will be.
* Before asking people to do more, find ways to take things off their plate (fix broken windows and/or reduce cognitive load).
