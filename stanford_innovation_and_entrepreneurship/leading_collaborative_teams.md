# Leading Collaborative Teams

## How to Overcome Difficulties

* Getting Information Out of Collaborators
  * Anticipate alternative viewpoints, take a learning mindset, ensure psychological safety, provide adequate time for processing/understanding/questions/etc
* Integrating Perspectives
  * Understand relevance and seek common ground, commit time to integration, understand other perspectives through effective communication, accept other perspectives and understand their value

## Conflict

* Affective Conflict - Emotional disagreement characterized by anger or hostility, personality clashes, etc
  * Just bad and to be avoided.
* Task Conflict - Content-focused disagreement about the work (goals, approaches, solutions, etc)
  * Increases processing, innovation, and performance (as long as there is not too much).
  * A lot can be learned exploring differences through low intensity conflict (moderate and high intensity is where it becomes problematic).
  * Divergent tasks in particular (enumerating options, etc) is a productive place for conflict.
  * Convergent and coordination tasks are not a productive area for conflict, and this can bleed into affective conflict.
  * Take care to keep affective and task conflict separate, focus conversation on ideas, not people.

## Attribution Theory

* Personal/Dispositional Attribution - explain behaviors as something about the person
* Situational Attribution - explain behavior as something about the situation
* Ingroup Bias - more harsh attribution toward other subgroups (often personal/dispositional)
* Information Bias - more harsh attribution when lacking clarifying information (often the missing context is situational)

## Reducing Us vs Them Dynamics

* Create diverse groups, as more homogeneity tends to cause more ingroup bias.
* Find and make connections across groups. Missing this can lead to NIH and fear of losing power.
* Provide Shared Identity - reduces affective conflict, makes clearer how different groups contribute.
* Build Trust - willingness to be vulnerable to actions of another person based on the expectation that the other person will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that person
  * Elements: Benevolence (we care about the same things), Ability (are they able to deliver), Integrity (will they do what they say)
  * Collocated teams and distributed teams have similar trust levels, but collocated are more volatile (as there is a tighter feedback loop). Due to less feedback, setting the right expectations when forming a distributed team is critical.
* Psychological Safety - shared belief that it is safe to take interpersonal risk
  * Leader sets the tone
  * Reflection helps - focus on performance/process, consider improvements, develop/implement strategies
* Pay attention to rewards. Rewarding local goals can undermine collaboration and lead to a competitive environment.

## Navigating Cultural Differences

* Dimensions of Culture
  * Relation to the environment - harmony vs mastery
  * Relations among people - collective vs individual vs heirarchy
    * Collective cultures may prefer heirarchical decisions to maintain harmony vs individualist preferring autonomy.
  * Mode of activity - doing vs thinking
  * Time - monochronic vs polychronic
  * low-context cultures focus narrowly on the question at hand, whereas high-context consider the surrounding context

* Aspects of Cultural Intelligence
  * Drive - motivation to adapt
  * Knowledge - extent of understanding of different cultures
  * Strategy - extent of planning/preparation
  * Action - ability to make changes to work in different cultures

* Practices are only best in a particular cultural context. It may be best to co-create new practices, rather than trying to transfer existing ones.

* Power Dynamic Challenges
  * Access to information; ie access to executives, expertise, customers, other workers, etc
  * Feeling heard; ie access to deciders
  * Having opportunities

## Traversing Language Divides

* Perceptions of language skill can lead to feeling excluded, stupid, powerless, and/or angry.
* Language is closely tied to emotion, a key component of identity, and influences memories of experiences and categorization processes.
* Language also affects worldviews (action vs outcome), is key to relationships, grants status/influence, and is a mean of expressing professional competence.
* Lead across language through: patience and perspective taking, removing stigma, tempering English domination, and verifying shared understanding.

## Transboundary Team Members

* Bridge communications between subgroups, helping them be more effective, feel more valued, etc. But can leave the spanner feeling outside.
* Develop these capabilities by seeking out new experiences with different groups, learning about others from their perspective, practice reconciling values/attitudes/assumptions, experimenting, etc.
* Can be assisted by weakening norms, making the role more explicit, providing autonomy, encouring experimentation, and fostering psychological safety and reflection.

## Getting People Together

* Discuss work, discuss peronal information/socialize, and observe work and social behavior.
* Use these to produce understanding of: work and communication styles, capabilities and interests, personalities, social roles, and cultural context.
* This understanding results in: increased responsiveness, more frequent communication, more personal disclosure and discussion of difficult topics.
* Taken together, these increase trust, increase feeling understood, and allow us to see our own culture/profession/etc through other's eyes
