Leading Collaborative Teams

# Module 1: Course Overview
# Module 2: The Paradox of Cross-Boundary Work

## 2.2 Working Across Boundaries

### Reflection 2.1:

* Describe what you find interesting about Flemming’s graph.
  * Lower diversity consistently delivers average value. Higher diversity has the potential for breakthrough high value, but also much lower value. So there is more variability.

### Exercise 2.2

* Describe an experience that you’ve had working on a cross-boundary team (or a cross-boundary collaboration), especially one in which you were working with other in different disciplines, geographies, across cultures/languages, or in a different company.
  * My background is as an engineer, but for various reasons, I chose to take on a roll as a product manager for ~ 9 months (at which point I stopped as it was not working well).
* What boundary(ies) were you crossing?
  * Most obviously, I was crossing a role boundary between engineering and product, without prior experience. I was also one of the only people taking this on as a remote employee. I also found working and collaboration styles to be drastically different from what I was used to.
* What was the innovation potential of this team/collaboration?
  * I think there was a high potential, as I brought a deep knowledge of what we had and where it could go, and my colleagues had a deep understanding of what our customers wanted and needed.
* In what ways did the team/collaboration live up to its innovation potential?
  * We had many good discussions and came up with a lot of exciting ideas on how to proceed.
* In what ways did it achieve or miss the innovation opportunity?
  * Differences in personality, and working style ultimately caused miscommunication and break downs around planning which cancelled out progress and projects were eventually cancelled/reversed.

Failures to deliver innovation often result from difficulty in getting information out and/or integrating perspectives.

### How to Get Information Out of Collaborations:

* Anticipate/prepare for alternative viewpoints
* Take a learning mindset/orientation
* Ensure people feel valued and feel safe
* Provide adequate time to process viewpoints, understand them, ask questions, etc

### How to Integrate Diverse Perspectives

* Understand relevance and seek common ground.
* Commit time to integration
* Overcome representational gaps (how problems are represented based on: functional background, disciplinary training, experience, etc)
  * Understand perspective of others through effective communication
  * Accept other's perspective as legitimate and understand the value of their particular contribution

### Reflection 2.3

* Take the same cross-boundary collaboration that you described earlier. What three specific things would you do differently to help that team/collaboration achieve more of its innovation potential?
  * We would have been better off if we had clearly committed to the integration, set aside time to learn each others perspectives, and focused more on learning.

## 2.3 Conflict and Collaboration

### Types of Conflict

* Affective Conflict - Emotional disagreement characterized by anger or hostility, personality clashes, etc
  * Just bad: lower satisfaction, increased turnover, less sharing, decreased productivity, etc.
* Task Conflict - Content-focused disagreement over what is to be done (goals, approaches, solutions, etc)
  * Increased information processing, more innovation, better performance (as long as there is not too much conflict)
  * We can gain a lot through exploring differences, through low intensity conflict. (moderate and high intensity is when people take sides, then become entrenched, etc)
  * Divergent Tasks (enumerating options, etc) is a productive place for conflict.
  * It becomes less productive as you get into convergent and coordination tasks, where conflict can be toxic and bleed into affective conflict.
  * Take care to keep affective and task conflicts separate, focus conversations on the ideas, not the people who espouse them.

### Reflection 2.4

* Do you believe that conflict is good or bad? Why?
  * I don't think it is inherently good or bad. Without some tension, we tend to get stuck in average output. But without a good resolution, it is often bad.

### Conflict Management

Style Survey -> Competing: 3, Avoid: 2, Accomodate: 3, Collaborate: 7, Compromise: 5

* Competing: high own concern, low other's concerns; works well for quick decisions where others need not be bought in and/or you have the most knowledge
* Avoid: low own concern, low other's concerns; may make sense if there is affective conflict, or if we don't yet have enough information
* Accomodate: low own concern, high other's concerns; works well when you are not that invested (or the other person is much more invested)
* Collaborate: high own concern, high other's concerns; ideal for best outcomes, but this takes more time, patience, and active leadership
* Compromise: mid own concern, mid other's concerns; may be good-enough if you don't have enough time (or too much conflict) to reach collaboration
