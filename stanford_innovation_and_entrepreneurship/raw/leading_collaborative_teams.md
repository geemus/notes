Leading Collaborative Teams

# Module 1: Course Overview
# Module 2: The Paradox of Cross-Boundary Work

## 2.2 Working Across Boundaries

Failures to deliver innovation often result from difficulty in getting information out and/or integrating perspectives.

### How to Get Information Out of Collaborations:

* Anticipate/prepare for alternative viewpoints
* Take a learning mindset/orientation
* Ensure people feel valued and feel safe
* Provide adequate time to process viewpoints, understand them, ask questions, etc

### How to Integrate Diverse Perspectives

* Understand relevance and seek common ground.
* Commit time to integration
* Overcome representational gaps (how problems are represented based on: functional background, disciplinary training, experience, etc)
  * Understand perspective of others through effective communication
  * Accept other's perspective as legitimate and understand the value of their particular contribution

## 2.3 Conflict and Collaboration

### Types of Conflict

* Affective Conflict - Emotional disagreement characterized by anger or hostility, personality clashes, etc
  * Just bad: lower satisfaction, increased turnover, less sharing, decreased productivity, etc.
* Task Conflict - Content-focused disagreement over what is to be done (goals, approaches, solutions, etc)
  * Increased information processing, more innovation, better performance (as long as there is not too much conflict)
  * We can gain a lot through exploring differences, through low intensity conflict. (moderate and high intensity is when people take sides, then become entrenched, etc)
  * Divergent Tasks (enumerating options, etc) is a productive place for conflict.
  * It becomes less productive as you get into convergent and coordination tasks, where conflict can be toxic and bleed into affective conflict.
  * Take care to keep affective and task conflicts separate, focus conversations on the ideas, not the people who espouse them.

### Conflict Management

Style Survey -> Competing: 3, Avoid: 2, Accomodate: 3, Collaborate: 7, Compromise: 5

* Competing: high own concern, low other's concerns; works well for quick decisions where others need not be bought in and/or you have the most knowledge
* Avoid: low own concern, low other's concerns; may make sense if there is affective conflict, or if we don't yet have enough information
* Accomodate: low own concern, high other's concerns; works well when you are not that invested (or the other person is much more invested)
* Collaborate: high own concern, high other's concerns; ideal for best outcomes, but this takes more time, patience, and active leadership
* Compromise: mid own concern, mid other's concerns; may be good-enough if you don't have enough time (or too much conflict) to reach collaboration

## Exercises & Reflection

* 2.1 Describe what you find interesting about Flemming’s graph.
  * Lower diversity consistently delivers average value. Higher diversity has the potential for breakthrough high value, but also much lower value. So there is more variability.
* 2.2 Describe an experience that you’ve had working on a cross-boundary team (or a cross-boundary collaboration), especially one in which you were working with other in different disciplines, geographies, across cultures/languages, or in a different company.
  * My background is as an engineer, but for various reasons, I chose to take on a roll as a product manager for ~ 9 months (at which point I stopped as it was not working well).
* 2.2 What boundary(ies) were you crossing?
  * Most obviously, I was crossing a role boundary between engineering and product, without prior experience. I was also one of the only people taking this on as a remote employee. I also found working and collaboration styles to be drastically different from what I was used to.
* 2.2 What was the innovation potential of this team/collaboration?
  * I think there was a high potential, as I brought a deep knowledge of what we had and where it could go, and my colleagues had a deep understanding of what our customers wanted and needed.
* 2.2 In what ways did the team/collaboration live up to its innovation potential?
  * We had many good discussions and came up with a lot of exciting ideas on how to proceed.
* 2.2 In what ways did it achieve or miss the innovation opportunity?
  * Differences in personality, and working style ultimately caused miscommunication and break downs around planning which cancelled out progress and projects were eventually cancelled/reversed.
* 2.3 Take the same cross-boundary collaboration that you described earlier. What three specific things would you do differently to help that team/collaboration achieve more of its innovation potential?
  * We would have been better off if we had clearly committed to the integration, set aside time to learn each others perspectives, and focused more on learning.
* 2.4 Do you believe that conflict is good or bad? Why?
  * I don't think it is inherently good or bad. Without some tension, we tend to get stuck in average output. But without a good resolution, it is often bad.

# Module 3: Trust and The Emergence of Us vs Them Dynamics

## The Challenges and Opportunities in Cross-Boundary Work

* us vs them
* fear
* misaligned incentives

### Attribution Theory

* How do people explain the behaviors of themselves and others?
  * Personal/Dispositional attribution - explain things as something about the person
  * Situational attribution - explain things as something about the situation
  * Ingroup bias - harsh attributions across subgroups (often personal/dispositional attribution)
  * Information bias - absence of claryifying information (often the missing context is situational)

As leaders, we should remind people that we should solicit more information before jumping to conclusions.

* How can we reduce/prevent attribution problems?
  * Weaken subgroups by minimizing "faultlines", this can be done by having more diverse teams (as the more commonality, the more us vs them will happen)
  * Work to find and make connections across groups as well

* Overcoming Us vs Them Dynamics
  * Shared Identity - a common sense of what we are doing, that we are in it together, and that we are all contributing.
    * Greatly reduces affective conflict.
    * Provide clear vision of where we are headed and how different groups contribute.
  * Trust - willingness to be vulnerable to actions of another person based on the expectation that the other person will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that person
    * Elements of trust: Benevolence (do we care about the same things), Ability (are they able to deliver), Integrity (will they do what they say)
    * Collocated and Distributed teams have similar overall trust, but collocated trust is more volatile (likely due to more access to information/behavior).
    * Because distributed teams have fewer opportunities to update trust over time, it is critical to set the right level at the outset.
  * Psychological Safety - shared belief held by a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.
    * Strong positive effects for: Performance, Problem Solving, Learning & Innovation.
    * Leader sets the tone by being open, accessible and available. Focus on inclusivity. Transformational & servant leadership also aide.
    * Reflection Practice helps a lot
      * Team reflection can improve trust & psychological safety
      * Guided reflection
        * reflect on performance/process
        * consider potential improvements
        * develop (and implement) strategies
      * makes teams omer effective, but takes time

* Silo Mentality
  * Coordination may be undermined by inability to identify with other subunits, leading to NIH and/or fear of losing power.
  * Rewarding for local goals can undermine collaboration (as helping others takes time away from your own goals) and can lead to a competitive, rather than collaborative environment.

## Exercises

* 3.1 Bring to mind a time when a cross-boundary team or project member disappointed you or did not meet your expectations. Write a few sentences explaining why things went wrong? What explains their lack of performance?
  * When I was attempting to do product management, I was dissapointed how difficult it was to have discussions about technical needs and merit. Additionally, it seemed as though emotional appeals and/or highest ranked person ruled the day, rather than facts and data. As someone who finds it challenging to read people, this made it nearly impossible for me to get the lay of the land.
* 3.2 Bring to mind someone that you trust completely. Why do you trust that person?
  * I trust my manager. He has demonstrated good judgement and provided valuable feedback consistently over time.
* 3.2 What characteristics do they have that lead you to trust them?
  * We have a track record of working well together. He listens well and gives valuable feedback. I feel heard and respected.
* 3.3 Is there less trust on cross-boundary teams? Why or why not?
  * I don't think cross-boundary should impact ability or integrity issues necessarilly, but it may make benevolence harder without clear shared vision.
* 3.4 What were the major cross-boundary challenges faced by the team that designed and built the Water Cube?
  * Cross disciplinary integration and prioritization. Cultural and language barriers. Us vs them between geographically distributed teams.
* 3.4 What specific practices and processes enabled the team to overcome these challenges?
  * Early collaboration, before too much was already designed/locked in. Strong leadership under time pressure. Shared information/models with automation to produce what different people needed. Brought clients in as early collaborators. Build safe, autonomous groups with clear interfaces. Exchanging specialists. Bringing together diverse management to discuss how to address differences.
* 3.4 What insights for managing cross-boundary initiatives can you find in the Water Cube project?
  * Diverse engagement lead to novel, timely solutions across a range of challenges. Collaboration started very early in the process and was maintained throughout. Some divide and concur was established through leadership collaboration. Care was taken in defining interfaces and expectations between teams, and in managing/updating these over time.
* 3.5 In the Hansen chapter, he talks about four barriers that typically block cross-unit collaboration. Write a short paragraph about each of these barriers. Describe the behavior, why it happens, and how it interferes with collaboration.
  1. Not invented here (NIH), where people insist on their own solutions, caused by insular culture, status gaps, self-reliance norms, and fear of vulnerability.
  2. Hoarding, where people withold even when asked, caused by competitive norms, narrow incentives, time famine, fear of losing power (knowledge is power).
  3. Search Barrier, inability to find available information, caused by company size, physical distance, information overload, and poverty of networks.
  4. Trasfer Barrier, where people struggle to transfer expertise/know-how/tech, caused by tacit knowledge, lack of common frame, and weak ties.

# Module 4: Navigating Cultural Differences

## 4.1 Cultural Differences

* Cross-Cultural teaming allows access to different pools of expertise, spreads risk, increases globalization, and reduces time to market.
* Global teams provide unique challenges due to distance, and cultural context.

* Dimensions of Culture
  * Relation to the environment - harmony vs mastery
  * Relations among people - collective vs individual vs heirarchy
  * Mode of activity - doing vs thinking
  * Time - monochronic vs polychronic
* Meaning of choice. In more individualist cultures, autonomy is desired, whereas in more collective cultures, heirarchical decisions are preferred to not rock the boat.
* Some cultures have more sport oriented team ideas, whereas other cultures have more family oriented team ideas.
* Low context cultures are very focused on what is nearest to the question at hand, whereas high context cultures look out to the surrounding context.
* Knowing about these dimensions can be helpful to talk about differences, but we must be wary of this leading us toward stereotypes.

* Cultural Intelligence
  * Drive - motivation to adapt
  * Knowledge - extent of understanding of different cultures
  * Strategy - extent of planning/preparation
  * Action - ability to make changes to work in different cultures

* Nested Culture = [[[[individual action <-> pattern of interaction] <-> local context] <-> individual context] <-> cultural orientation]
* Transferring from heterogenous cultures to homogenous is very difficult, but transfering the other way is often easier.
* Practices are only best in particular cultural contexts. Co-creating new global best practices may be more effective than trying to transfer existing best practices.

* Sources of Challenge around Power Dynamics
  * Accessing to information, ie access to executives, expertise, customers, other workers
  * Feeling heard, ie access to deciders
  * Having opportunities

* Types of Power Dynamics
  * Contested between sites where power is balanced
  * Shifting from current site to new site
  * Resigned to imbalance
  * Shared power, with care taken to distribute, intentially provide access/opportunity/etc

## Exercises/Reflections

* 4.1 A team is like a village. Different people have slightly different concerns, but we are all reliant on one another to succeed overall.
* 4.2 Identify 1-2 dimensions of cultural intelligence that you would like to improve upon.
  * I would like to improve my strategy and action.
* 4.2 What are 1-2 concrete things you could do to increase your cultural intelligence?
  * I could be more intentional about making a plan about how to navigate upcoming cultural encounters, and reflecting afterward and adjust for future encounters.
* 4.2 What are 2-3 things you could do to help develop the cultural intelligence of the teams you are working with?
  * I think, especially as I'm usually working remotely, that the biggest areas for focus are often around awareness and action. The lag of distributed meetings make it much harder to read the situation, but this can be greatly mitigated by carefully adjusting how we speak, pause, etc.
* 4.3 Write down three “best practices” that you use in your work, ideally something that makes you and your organization more innovative.
  * We emphasize autonomous decision making, broad information sharing, and respectful dissent/discussion.
* 4.3 What makes these practices “best”
  * In our highly technical context, whomever is closest to the problem is often most knowledgeable and frequently ultimately responsible, so they seem like a natural fit for decision making. In order to catch outlier decisions and help educate others, we then emphasize broadly sharing the decisions that have been made in autonomy. Finally, when there are outliers or missed insights, we expect that this will be brought to a respectful discussion that everyone can learn from.
* 4.3 Interview someone in a vastly different culture (as much as possible) and identify how these practices might work in this context. In particular, in what ways might these practices not be “best” in their context? In what ways might they fail? What adaptations might make sense?
  * I haven't done a net-new interview, but I've had many discussions about gaps and failures to draw from. Our push for autonomy has led to different decisions in very similar contexts, which is more costly than being able to share knowledge and resources. In part, I think this has been exacerbated by shortcomings in our effectiveness of recording and sharing information. We hope that by improving the fidelity and consistency of communications, it will be more likely that these things will surface and we can discuss and come to shared conclusions. That being said, we have also seen a number of individuals who may have good psychological safety at the team level, but lack it at the level required to share a proposal with the whole organization. We hope establishing clear working rules for interacting with proposals that this may be mitigated (and that discussions will remain respectful/productive).

# Module 5: Traversing Language Divides

## Language Proficiency

* Challenges: Basic words and syntax; Idioms; Inflections, tone, pitch; Norms of when and how to speak
* Perceptions of language skill can lead to feeling excluded, stupid, powerless, and/or angry.
* Language is closely tied to emotion, a key component of identity, and influences memories of experiences and categorization processes.
* Language also affects worldviews (action vs outcome), is key to relationships, grants status/influence, and is a means of expressing professional competence.
* Strategies for language challenges:
  * Non-Native Speakers: Withdraw, exclude others, curtail participation, codeswitch
  * Native Speakers: Withdraw/leave, request English, request translation
* Similar concerns appear for profession specific and/or firm specific language.
* If challenges can be overcome, we can learn and gain new perspectives.
* Leading across languages requires:
  * patience and perspective taking
  * removing stigma
  * temper English domination
  * verify shared understanding

## Exercises

* 5.1 If you have experience working in a non-native language, describe a little bit about what that was like, how you felt, how you experienced yourself, and what others thought of (or treated) you. (If you don’t have experience working in a non-native language, write a little about what you think it might be like for someone who works in a non-native language.)
  * I don't have much direct experience. From my own language learning, I know it is difficult and you can feel lost. Also, it is frustrating when you feel unable to express yourself.
* 5.2b Attend a talk that is far outside of your area of expertise. Just listen. Afterward, make notes.
  * 5.2b1 What didn't you understand?
    * I could understand the big picture, but much of the details and especially subtleties were lost on me. Additionally, I had to piece things together from context.
  * 5.2b2 How much did you miss?
    * I missed a lot. The goal was to speak to specifics on the topic, and I didn't have enough knowledge to get more than a broad overview.
  * 5.2b3 How did you feel about not understanding?
    * It was frustrating to feel like things were just out of reach, and to struggle with uncertainties about whether I was really understanding what was said.
  * 5.2b4 Once you've done this, make a few notes about what it would take to collaborate with this person or someone like them?
    * I think it would be rather challenging, at least initially. It would be hard to feel like we had a real connection, and things would move haltingly at best.
  * 5.2b5 What kinds of practices would you want to have in place so that you could understand one another?
    * I would try to do more active listening, with lots of "what I heard you say was, ..." to clarify/confirm.
    * I would seek analogies and metaphors to areas where we shared familiarity.
    * I would want some clear signal I could use when they should pause and explain a particular piece of jargon.

# Module 6: Practices for Leveraging Cross Boundary Teams

* collocated teams benefit from dense, unstructured networks; distributed teams benefit from communication bridges who facilitate communication
* transboundary team members:
  * can be unaware of their skills/abilitities, and face marginalization and/or identity suppression in order to fit in
  * have experience in multiple cultures, tend to have broader wold view, higher sensitivity, greater empathy, more complex ways of thinking
  * build bridges across subgroups
  * help groups feel valued, thus increasing participation
  * elicit knowledge and ideas from different groups
  * reduce "processing time" to tap multiple perspectives
  * see issues from multiple perspectives, mediate

## Developing Boundary Spanning Capabilities

* seek out experiences with unfamilier groups
* learn (deeply) about another group or profession, from their perspective
* practice reconciling differences in values, attitudes and assumptions
* try a different approach, experiment
* provide "optimal contact" situations to others: equal status, shared goals, interdependence

## Life as a Boundary Spanner

* higher levels of self-monitoring
* frequent adjustments to self-preservation
* trust is delicate, can come across as a "traitor" if you are seen to align too closely with one group or the other
* can experience burnout from "standing in the gap"

## What can help?

* weaken or suspend norms, as strong situations make it harder to span
* make the bridging role explicit
* provide autonomy
* encourage experimentation
* foster psychological safety & reflection

## Getting People Together

* Activities evoked by visits:
  * discussing work
  * discussing personal information and socializing
  * observing work and social behavior
* Activities produce understanding of:
  * work and communication styles
  * capabilities and interests
  * personalities
  * social roles
  * cultural context
* Understanding results in:
  * increased responsiveness
  * more frequent communication
  * more personal disclosure and discussion of difficult topics
* These increase trust

* together creates reflected knowledge, allowing us to feel more understood, but also seeing our own culture/profession/etc through other's eyes

## Exercises

* 6.1 Interview a transboundary team member or boundary spanner, someone who regularly plays the role of boundary spanner.
* 6.1 1 What boundaries do they span?
  * At different times: engineering groups, engineering+product+marketing, local engineering vs all-sfdc engineering, local vs remote, neurotypical vs autistim spectrum, etc.
* 6.1 2 What do they do as boundary spanners and why do they do it?
  * Help break down silos so that we are all more knowledgable and can learn from one another, because they value learning and see it as valuable to the company moving forward.
* 6.1 3 What is their expertise?
  * Background in engineering, with some community and event management. More recently a lot of process oriented work to try and provide consistency to spanning.
* 6.1 4 What are some of the challenges they face and what kind of support do they need?
  * It can be challenging to sit outside other groups, and sometimes their differences can seem irreconcilable. Also, it can be hard to really get good metrics across boundaries as feedback. Need to get and maintain buy-in, while avoiding any perception of favoritism.
* 6.1 5 After the interview, reflect and write 3-5 things that you might do to better support boundary spanning activities in your organization. Make sure to take notes of the major insights from your interview.
  * Recognize boundary spanners work and make it explicit to them (and others).
  * Encourage experimentation, as finding the right solution across groups in one go is unlikely.
  * Encourage consistency in metrics/etc to ease visibility into cross-group efforts.
  * Make norms/expectations explicit, where possible, so spanners have a kind of roadmap to work with.
  * Foster psychological safety so people feel comfortable crossing boundaries and "putting themselves out there".
