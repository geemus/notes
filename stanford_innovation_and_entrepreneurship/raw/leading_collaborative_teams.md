Leading Collaborative Teams

# Module 1: Course Overview
# Module 2: The Paradox of Cross-Boundary Work

## 2.2 Working Across Boundaries

### Reflection 2.1:

* Describe what you find interesting about Flemming’s graph.
  * Lower diversity consistently delivers average value. Higher diversity has the potential for breakthrough high value, but also much lower value. So there is more variability.

### Exercise 2.2

* Describe an experience that you’ve had working on a cross-boundary team (or a cross-boundary collaboration), especially one in which you were working with other in different disciplines, geographies, across cultures/languages, or in a different company.
  * My background is as an engineer, but for various reasons, I chose to take on a roll as a product manager for ~ 9 months (at which point I stopped as it was not working well).
* What boundary(ies) were you crossing?
  * Most obviously, I was crossing a role boundary between engineering and product, without prior experience. I was also one of the only people taking this on as a remote employee. I also found working and collaboration styles to be drastically different from what I was used to.
* What was the innovation potential of this team/collaboration?
  * I think there was a high potential, as I brought a deep knowledge of what we had and where it could go, and my colleagues had a deep understanding of what our customers wanted and needed.
* In what ways did the team/collaboration live up to its innovation potential?
  * We had many good discussions and came up with a lot of exciting ideas on how to proceed.
* In what ways did it achieve or miss the innovation opportunity?
  * Differences in personality, and working style ultimately caused miscommunication and break downs around planning which cancelled out progress and projects were eventually cancelled/reversed.

Failures to deliver innovation often result from difficulty in getting information out and/or integrating perspectives.

### How to Get Information Out of Collaborations:

* Anticipate/prepare for alternative viewpoints
* Take a learning mindset/orientation
* Ensure people feel valued and feel safe
* Provide adequate time to process viewpoints, understand them, ask questions, etc

### How to Integrate Diverse Perspectives

* Understand relevance and seek common ground.
* Commit time to integration
* Overcome representational gaps (how problems are represented based on: functional background, disciplinary training, experience, etc)
  * Understand perspective of others through effective communication
  * Accept other's perspective as legitimate and understand the value of their particular contribution

### Reflection 2.3

* Take the same cross-boundary collaboration that you described earlier. What three specific things would you do differently to help that team/collaboration achieve more of its innovation potential?
  * We would have been better off if we had clearly committed to the integration, set aside time to learn each others perspectives, and focused more on learning.

## 2.3 Conflict and Collaboration

### Types of Conflict

* Affective Conflict - Emotional disagreement characterized by anger or hostility, personality clashes, etc
  * Just bad: lower satisfaction, increased turnover, less sharing, decreased productivity, etc.
* Task Conflict - Content-focused disagreement over what is to be done (goals, approaches, solutions, etc)
  * Increased information processing, more innovation, better performance (as long as there is not too much conflict)
  * We can gain a lot through exploring differences, through low intensity conflict. (moderate and high intensity is when people take sides, then become entrenched, etc)
  * Divergent Tasks (enumerating options, etc) is a productive place for conflict.
  * It becomes less productive as you get into convergent and coordination tasks, where conflict can be toxic and bleed into affective conflict.
  * Take care to keep affective and task conflicts separate, focus conversations on the ideas, not the people who espouse them.

### Reflection 2.4

* Do you believe that conflict is good or bad? Why?
  * I don't think it is inherently good or bad. Without some tension, we tend to get stuck in average output. But without a good resolution, it is often bad.

### Conflict Management

Style Survey -> Competing: 3, Avoid: 2, Accomodate: 3, Collaborate: 7, Compromise: 5

* Competing: high own concern, low other's concerns; works well for quick decisions where others need not be bought in and/or you have the most knowledge
* Avoid: low own concern, low other's concerns; may make sense if there is affective conflict, or if we don't yet have enough information
* Accomodate: low own concern, high other's concerns; works well when you are not that invested (or the other person is much more invested)
* Collaborate: high own concern, high other's concerns; ideal for best outcomes, but this takes more time, patience, and active leadership
* Compromise: mid own concern, mid other's concerns; may be good-enough if you don't have enough time (or too much conflict) to reach collaboration

# Module 3: Trust and The Emergence of Us vs Them Dynamics

## The Challenges and Opportunities in Cross-Boundary Work

* us vs them
* fear
* misaligned incentives

### Attribution Theory

* How do people explain the behaviors of themselves and others?
  * Personal/Dispositional attribution - explain things as something about the person
  * Situational attribution - explain things as something about the situation
  * Ingroup bias - harsh attributions across subgroups (often personal/dispositional attribution)
  * Information bias - absence of claryifying information (often the missing context is situational)

As leaders, we should remind people that we should solicit more information before jumping to conclusions.

* How can we reduce/prevent attribution problems?
  * Weaken subgroups by minimizing "faultlines", this can be done by having more diverse teams (as the more commonality, the more us vs them will happen)
  * Work to find and make connections across groups as well

* Overcoming Us vs Them Dynamics
  * Shared Identity - a common sense of what we are doing, that we are in it together, and that we are all contributing.
    * Greatly reduces affective conflict.
    * Provide clear vision of where we are headed and how different groups contribute.
  * Trust - willingness to be vulnerable to actions of another person based on the expectation that the other person will perform a a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that person
    * Elements of trust: Benevolence (do we care about the same things), Ability (are they able to deliver), Integrity (will they do what they say)
    * Collocated and Distributed teams have similar overall trust, but collocated trust is more volatile (likely due to more access to information/behavior).
    * Because distributed teams have fewer opportunities to update trust over time, it is critical to set the right level at the outset.
  * Psychological Safety - shared belief held by a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.
    * Strong positive effects for: Performance, Problem Solving, Learning & Innovation.
    * Leader sets the tone by being open, accessible and available. Focus on inclusivity. Transformational & servant leadership also aide.
    * Reflection Practice helps a lot
      * Team reflection can improve trust & psychological safety
      * Guided reflection
        * reflect on performance/process
        * consider potential improvements
        * develop (and implement) strategies
      * makes teams omer effective, but takes time

* Silo Mentality
  * Coordination may be undermined by inability to identify with other subunits, leading to NIH and/or fear of losing power.
  * Rewarding for local goals can undermine collaboration (as helping others takes time away from your own goals) and can lead to a competitive, rather than collaborative environment.

### Exercises

* 3.1 Bring to mind a time when a cross-boundary team or project member disappointed you or did not meet your expectations. Write a few sentences explaining why things went wrong? What explains their lack of performance?
  * When I was attempting to do product management, I was dissapointed how difficult it was to have discussions about technical needs and merit. Additionally, it seemed as though emotional appeals and/or highest ranked person ruled the day, rather than facts and data. As someone who finds it challenging to read people, this made it nearly impossible for me to get the lay of the land.
* 3.2 Bring to mind someone that you trust completely. Why do you trust that person?
  * I trust my manager. He has demonstrated good judgement and provided valuable feedback consistently over time.
* 3.2 What characteristics do they have that lead you to trust them?
  * We have a track record of working well together. He listens well and gives valuable feedback. I feel heard and respected.
* 3.3 Is there less trust on cross-boundary teams? Why or why not?
  * I don't think cross-boundary should impact ability or integrity issues necessarilly, but it may make benevolence harder without clear shared vision.
* 3.4 What were the major cross-boundary challenges faced by the team that designed and built the Water Cube?
  * Cross disciplinary integration and prioritization. Cultural and language barriers. Us vs them between geographically distributed teams.
* 3.4 What specific practices and processes enabled the team to overcome these challenges?
  * Early collaboration, before too much was already designed/locked in. Strong leadership under time pressure. Shared information/models with automation to produce what different people needed. Brought clients in as early collaborators. Build safe, autonomous groups with clear interfaces. Exchanging specialists. Bringing together diverse management to discuss how to address differences.
* 3.4 What insights for managing cross-boundary initiatives can you find in the Water Cube project?
  * Diverse engagement lead to novel, timely solutions across a range of challenges. Collaboration started very early in the process and was maintained throughout. Some divide and concur was established through leadership collaboration. Care was taken in defining interfaces and expectations between teams, and in managing/updating these over time.
* 3.5 In the Hansen chapter, he talks about four barriers that typically block cross-unit collaboration. Write a short paragraph about each of these barriers. Describe the behavior, why it happens, and how it interferes with collaboration.
  1. Not invented here (NIH), where people insist on their own solutions, caused by insular culture, status gaps, self-reliance norms, and fear of vulnerability.
  2. Hoarding, where people withold even when asked, caused by competitive norms, narrow incentives, time famine, fear of losing power (knowledge is power).
  3. Search Barrier, inability to find available information, caused by company size, physical distance, information overload, and poverty of networks.
  4. Trasfer Barrier, where people struggle to transfer expertise/know-how/tech, caused by tacit knowledge, lack of common frame, and weak ties.
