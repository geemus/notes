Leading Innovation

# Module 1: Course Overview
# Module 2: Creativity and the Differences Between Routine and Creative Work

Oversimplification: Creativity + Implementation = Innovation

Snowshoe story. Created innovative snow shoe, only to find there wasn't really a market. So had to work to educate and create demand as well as product.

## 2.2 Creativity at the Intersection

* Creativity is almost always doing new things with old things. ie bringing old ideas to new products, people, places, etc. Creating new combinations of old ideas.
* Fast creativity comes from "import-export" thinking. Find new places to put your ideas and/or find new ideas you can use/combine with your own.
* Be an idea collector and leave time for introspection/perspective.
* "If it makes you squirm a little bit, that may mean it is something worth paying attention to as it is pushing your boundaries/sensibilities"

## 2.4 Innovative vs Routine Work

* Routine seeks to drive out variation and failure; innovative seeks to increase variation (and expect high failure rate).
* "Where is your place for rapid learning? What is your process for failure?" - provide a clear place/time/process, emphasize when we are learning and when we are executing. Be wary of this leaving people with an impression that there are only particular places where one can innovate.
* Routine work sees the same old things in the same old way, innovative sees the same old things in new ways.
* Sometimes a great shortcut can be to get perspectives about something from a group that is not yet familiar, as they will not bring existing perspective/bias to bear.
* Balancing Innovation and Routine Work
  * Value in being transparent about timeline, who is involved, what to expect, and how it relates to existing work.
  * Skunkworks tends not to work well, as when they come back people are not bought in, don't understand, etc.
  * Integrating the two styles of work allows people to engage, provide feedback/insights, etc.
  * Orbit the giant hairball (routine work), periodically land to check-in and get feedback, then return to orbit.
* Routine work benefits from keeping execution and reflection distinct; innovation benefits from them blurring together more.
* Innovation from mind of a child: be in the moment, explore, be curious, play.
* Sometimes you need to kill not just bad ideas, but some good ones as well. They can otherwise be distracting and/or keep you from finding the best ideas.
* "Prototype as if you are right and listen as if you are wrong"
* Failure sucks, but Raney's Corollary: "you only learn when things start breaking"
* "You can do everything wrong but still fail", technology will come to market when the market is ready, also this stuff is hard.

## Exercises

* 2.1 Take a few minutes to think about the notion that innovation requires leading for both creativity and implementation. Think about your strengths and weaknesses as a current or future leader.  With that in mind, create a list of 5 to 7 lessons you hope to get out of this course about honing your leadership skills.
  * Further ideas about how to get the best output from people.
  * How to better balance execution vs investment.
  * How to make space for more creativity without getting lost in bikeshedding.
  * How to generate more and better ideas.
  * How to drive great ideas through to buy-in and implementation.
* 2.2 Think about the kind of work you do, the people you work with, and something creative you want to do. Think about things you could do and the ways in which you could create or find an “intersection” in which you could share your ideas and be exposed to new ideas. Please send us a list of five to seven ideas.
  * I work within an acquired company, and have purposely placed myself in a position where a lot of my work is within the acquired company, but another large (and growing) portion of my work is at the scale of the acquirer. This happened somewhat by chance, but increasingly I have been trying to cultivate this as the value has become more apparent.
  * I organize a local club that reads and discusses computer science research papers. The papers themselves are almost never a topic I am particularly familiar with, let alone an expert.
  * Historically I helped organize part of a local festival, where I brought a bit more of a technical bent to things. I have taken a hiatus with the birth of my first child last year, but look forward to returning to this and the exposure to different ideas and perspectives that always came along with it.
  * I have been working on some local non-profit boards, which provide another opportunity to practice leadership in a much different context with people from quite distinct backgrounds. I must say I can find it a bit frustrating at times, but it also gives me new ideas and perspectives.
  * With a new baby, I have found the amount of routine tasks and chores I need to do on a regular basis has risen drastically. I've done my best to use this as an opportunity to still learn/grow by picking up a strong habit of listening to a variety of different podcasts. They tend to cluster toward a few particular subject areas, but I try to maintain a few that are different enough to keep me thinking/pondering.
  * Part of my hope in undertaking this certificate program is to learn more about academic research and what is happening in the broader industry so I can have more insight and perspective into how to best approach problems I find.
  * I am an avid board gamer, which I find actually has provided a lot of insights into both technical writing and process management tasks.
* 2.3 As Diego likes to say, “failure sucks but instructs.” There cannot be innovation without it. You may recall a Sheryl Crow song called “My Favorite Mistake.” Please think about your favorite mistake you’ve made, and tell us about it.
  * In the recent past, as I was exploring next steps in my career, I took a detour from engineering individual contributor (IC) through product management. I had imagined this to be parallel-ish to what I wanted to do and there were immediate openings, vs no clear path forward as an IC at that time. It turns out that I was REALLY bad at integrating into our PM organization. Some of this was likely due to my relative inexperience, but also having a much different perspective and not having existing relationships with colleagues really came together to doom the effort. It did help me to learn much more about how they talk about and approach problems though, and ultimately I was able to return from that with more clarity about what I really wanted to do (which has led to a rather successful redefinition of next steps and progression as an IC to a new type of role I was more or less able to design for myself). All that said, I was definitely really uncomfortable throughout the actual experience...

# Module 3: Leadership

## Leadership Fundamentals (see also Good Boss, Bad Boss)

* Being in tune - self-awareness, how it feels to work for them, how they come across, how to get the best from others
  * great bosses are self-obsessed - not egotistical/selfish, but iterating/honing self-awareness and empathy
  * toxic tandem - combination of overattentive subordinates and inattentive bosses
  * power poisoning (effect of getting power) - focus more on own needs/concerns, focus less on needs of others, act like rules do not apply to them (ie Berkeley cookie study)
  * self-delusion - tend to self-evaluate much more favorably than peer reviews would suggest is accurate
  * insulated from reality, as messengers are shot.
  * ask good questions, listen to everyone, then synthesize your own answer
  * balance "front stage" and "back stage" behaviors, in order to be effective but also project the right things (because people are watching in a disproportionately close fashion)
* Assertiveness - best bosses are rated about average in terms of competitive, aggressive, and passive, because they should be tuned based on the situation
  * managers often overestimate their value and underestimate the damage of watching/nagging, managers should
  * "first do no harm" - most innovative leaders devote less attention to individuals, allow acting without permission, and don't consistently enforce rules
  * "after you plant a seed, you don't gig it up every week to see how it is doing" - 3M's Wlliam Coyne
  * don't intervene if ideas are being generated, everyone is participating, etc (divergent tasks)
  * do intervene when decisions need to be made, things need to move forward, etc (convergent tasks)
  * be clear about when to expect intervention or not to ensure it is predictable and more consistent (and can be things that can be improved over time)
* Small wins - long term is essential, but without focus on next steps they freeze up/freak out (see also The Progress Principle book)
  * Something like 1% big goals, 99% next steps.
  * Even biggest accomplishments rest on series of intertwined smaller wins.
  * Best bosses frame as series of manageable and doable steps, leading to better decisions, sustained motivation, and stops people from freaking out.
  * HBR: Start the New Year with Progress
    * Note progress from team/org (major accomplishments and small wins) and communicate broadly.
    * Celebrate progress and those who contributed (including support staff).
    * Map out upcoming goals and why they matter. Include both broad, aspirational and smaller, interim goals.
    * Resolve to support progress each day by providing goals/resources/time and removing/reducing obstacles. Insist people support one another and that everyone should be looking every day for chances to help colleaguse move forward on meaningful work.
* Having their backs - best bosses protect people from harm, intrusions, distractions, indignities, idiots, and idiocy of every stripe.
  * how are you using meetings?
    * power grab - show how powerful you are and control (show up late, hold people late; both imply they are the most important/valuable person)
    * Will Wright - end the meeting when someone starts looking antsy, charge $1/meeting you schedule (or similar)

## Exercises

* 3.1 Identify a clueless leader you have worked with or observed in the past. Please list 3-5 ways in which this boss was or is clueless, and tell us why these behaviors are destructive. Think about the lessons you have learned from this leader. If you are a boss, or if you ever are a boss, what could you do to avoid turning into one of these clueless leaders?
  * They established a monthly all company check-in, in which people were regularly eviscerated. It became a very time consuming task to prepare to give an appraisal that painted things in the best light possible to avoid attention/response.
  * They frequently seemed to disregard the concerns and opinions of others in the room and make decisions by fiat. This caused a lot of churn and frustration.
  * They acted as though others should be able to read between the lines, and were often not explicit enough about expectations. This led to larger conflict/tensions when these issues came to light later.
  * Often seemed out of touch with what was happening more broadly and as a result their decisions/input often felt out of touch with reality.
* 3.2 What are some signs that a leader is pushing people too hard?
  * If pushing too hard: stop getting ideas/input from others, get people feeling burned out, less creativity.
* 3.2 What are some signs that a leader is not pushing people hard enough?
  * If not pushing hard enough: people checked out/not engaged, slipping deadlines/accountability, lack of alignment.
* 3.3 Now, think about something you will do in the next week to hone your leadership skills in some small way. After you have attempted this task, please write up an analysis of your efforts and the outcome.
  *
* 3.4 When is it a bad idea to shield the people you lead?
  * If there is direct feedback that would be valuable for them to hear, relaying it often loses things in translation. ie hearing directly from customers about their experiences is valuable.
