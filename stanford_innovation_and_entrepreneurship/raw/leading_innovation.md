Leading Innovation

# Module 1: Course Overview
# Module 2: Creativity and the Differences Between Routine and Creative Work

Oversimplification: Creativity + Implementation = Innovation

Snowshoe story. Created innovative snow shoe, only to find there wasn't really a market. So had to work to educate and create demand as well as product.

## 2.2 Creativity at the Intersection

* Creativity is almost always doing new things with old things. ie bringing old ideas to new products, people, places, etc. Creating new combinations of old ideas.
* Fast creativity comes from "import-export" thinking. Find new places to put your ideas and/or find new ideas you can use/combine with your own.
* Be an idea collector and leave time for introspection/perspective.
* "If it makes you squirm a little bit, that may mean it is something worth paying attention to as it is pushing your boundaries/sensibilities"

## 2.4 Innovative vs Routine Work

* Routine seeks to drive out variation and failure; innovative seeks to increase variation (and expect high failure rate).
* "Where is your place for rapid learning? What is your process for failure?" - provide a clear place/time/process, emphasize when we are learning and when we are executing. Be wary of this leaving people with an impression that there are only particular places where one can innovate.
* Routine work sees the same old things in the same old way, innovative sees the same old things in new ways.
* Sometimes a great shortcut can be to get perspectives about something from a group that is not yet familiar, as they will not bring existing perspective/bias to bear.
* Balancing Innovation and Routine Work
  * Value in being transparent about timeline, who is involved, what to expect, and how it relates to existing work.
  * Skunkworks tends not to work well, as when they come back people are not bought in, don't understand, etc.
  * Integrating the two styles of work allows people to engage, provide feedback/insights, etc.
  * Orbit the giant hairball (routine work), periodically land to check-in and get feedback, then return to orbit.
* Routine work benefits from keeping execution and reflection distinct; innovation benefits from them blurring together more.
* Innovation from mind of a child: be in the moment, explore, be curious, play.
* Sometimes you need to kill not just bad ideas, but some good ones as well. They can otherwise be distracting and/or keep you from finding the best ideas.
* "Prototype as if you are right and listen as if you are wrong"
* Failure sucks, but Raney's Corollary: "you only learn when things start breaking"
* "You can do everything wrong but still fail", technology will come to market when the market is ready, also this stuff is hard.

## Exercises

* 2.1 Take a few minutes to think about the notion that innovation requires leading for both creativity and implementation. Think about your strengths and weaknesses as a current or future leader.  With that in mind, create a list of 5 to 7 lessons you hope to get out of this course about honing your leadership skills.
  * Further ideas about how to get the best output from people.
  * How to better balance execution vs investment.
  * How to make space for more creativity without getting lost in bikeshedding.
  * How to generate more and better ideas.
  * How to drive great ideas through to buy-in and implementation.
* 2.2 Think about the kind of work you do, the people you work with, and something creative you want to do. Think about things you could do and the ways in which you could create or find an “intersection” in which you could share your ideas and be exposed to new ideas. Please send us a list of five to seven ideas.
  * I work within an acquired company, and have purposely placed myself in a position where a lot of my work is within the acquired company, but another large (and growing) portion of my work is at the scale of the acquirer. This happened somewhat by chance, but increasingly I have been trying to cultivate this as the value has become more apparent.
  * I organize a local club that reads and discusses computer science research papers. The papers themselves are almost never a topic I am particularly familiar with, let alone an expert.
  * Historically I helped organize part of a local festival, where I brought a bit more of a technical bent to things. I have taken a hiatus with the birth of my first child last year, but look forward to returning to this and the exposure to different ideas and perspectives that always came along with it.
  * I have been working on some local non-profit boards, which provide another opportunity to practice leadership in a much different context with people from quite distinct backgrounds. I must say I can find it a bit frustrating at times, but it also gives me new ideas and perspectives.
  * With a new baby, I have found the amount of routine tasks and chores I need to do on a regular basis has risen drastically. I've done my best to use this as an opportunity to still learn/grow by picking up a strong habit of listening to a variety of different podcasts. They tend to cluster toward a few particular subject areas, but I try to maintain a few that are different enough to keep me thinking/pondering.
  * Part of my hope in undertaking this certificate program is to learn more about academic research and what is happening in the broader industry so I can have more insight and perspective into how to best approach problems I find.
  * I am an avid board gamer, which I find actually has provided a lot of insights into both technical writing and process management tasks.
* 2.3 As Diego likes to say, “failure sucks but instructs.” There cannot be innovation without it. You may recall a Sheryl Crow song called “My Favorite Mistake.” Please think about your favorite mistake you’ve made, and tell us about it.
  * In the recent past, as I was exploring next steps in my career, I took a detour from engineering individual contributor (IC) through product management. I had imagined this to be parallel-ish to what I wanted to do and there were immediate openings, vs no clear path forward as an IC at that time. It turns out that I was REALLY bad at integrating into our PM organization. Some of this was likely due to my relative inexperience, but also having a much different perspective and not having existing relationships with colleagues really came together to doom the effort. It did help me to learn much more about how they talk about and approach problems though, and ultimately I was able to return from that with more clarity about what I really wanted to do (which has led to a rather successful redefinition of next steps and progression as an IC to a new type of role I was more or less able to design for myself). All that said, I was definitely really uncomfortable throughout the actual experience...

# Module 3: Leadership

## Leadership Fundamentals (see also Good Boss, Bad Boss)

* Being in tune - self-awareness, how it feels to work for them, how they come across, how to get the best from others
  * great bosses are self-obsessed - not egotistical/selfish, but iterating/honing self-awareness and empathy
  * toxic tandem - combination of overattentive subordinates and inattentive bosses
  * power poisoning (effect of getting power) - focus more on own needs/concerns, focus less on needs of others, act like rules do not apply to them (ie Berkeley cookie study)
  * self-delusion - tend to self-evaluate much more favorably than peer reviews would suggest is accurate
  * insulated from reality, as messengers are shot.
  * ask good questions, listen to everyone, then synthesize your own answer
  * balance "front stage" and "back stage" behaviors, in order to be effective but also project the right things (because people are watching in a disproportionately close fashion)
* Assertiveness - best bosses are rated about average in terms of competitive, aggressive, and passive, because they should be tuned based on the situation
  * managers often overestimate their value and underestimate the damage of watching/nagging, managers should
  * "first do no harm" - most innovative leaders devote less attention to individuals, allow acting without permission, and don't consistently enforce rules
  * "after you plant a seed, you don't gig it up every week to see how it is doing" - 3M's Wlliam Coyne
  * don't intervene if ideas are being generated, everyone is participating, etc (divergent tasks)
  * do intervene when decisions need to be made, things need to move forward, etc (convergent tasks)
  * be clear about when to expect intervention or not to ensure it is predictable and more consistent (and can be things that can be improved over time)
* Small wins - long term is essential, but without focus on next steps they freeze up/freak out (see also The Progress Principle book)
  * Something like 1% big goals, 99% next steps.
  * Even biggest accomplishments rest on series of intertwined smaller wins.
  * Best bosses frame as series of manageable and doable steps, leading to better decisions, sustained motivation, and stops people from freaking out.
  * HBR: Start the New Year with Progress
    * Note progress from team/org (major accomplishments and small wins) and communicate broadly.
    * Celebrate progress and those who contributed (including support staff).
    * Map out upcoming goals and why they matter. Include both broad, aspirational and smaller, interim goals.
    * Resolve to support progress each day by providing goals/resources/time and removing/reducing obstacles. Insist people support one another and that everyone should be looking every day for chances to help colleaguse move forward on meaningful work.
* Having their backs - best bosses protect people from harm, intrusions, distractions, indignities, idiots, and idiocy of every stripe.
  * how are you using meetings?
    * power grab - show how powerful you are and control (show up late, hold people late; both imply they are the most important/valuable person)
    * Will Wright - end the meeting when someone starts looking antsy, charge $1/meeting you schedule (or similar)

## Exercises

* 3.1 Identify a clueless leader you have worked with or observed in the past. Please list 3-5 ways in which this boss was or is clueless, and tell us why these behaviors are destructive. Think about the lessons you have learned from this leader. If you are a boss, or if you ever are a boss, what could you do to avoid turning into one of these clueless leaders?
  * They established a monthly all company check-in, in which people were regularly eviscerated. It became a very time consuming task to prepare to give an appraisal that painted things in the best light possible to avoid attention/response.
  * They frequently seemed to disregard the concerns and opinions of others in the room and make decisions by fiat. This caused a lot of churn and frustration.
  * They acted as though others should be able to read between the lines, and were often not explicit enough about expectations. This led to larger conflict/tensions when these issues came to light later.
  * Often seemed out of touch with what was happening more broadly and as a result their decisions/input often felt out of touch with reality.
* 3.2 What are some signs that a leader is pushing people too hard?
  * If pushing too hard: stop getting ideas/input from others, get people feeling burned out, less creativity.
* 3.2 What are some signs that a leader is not pushing people hard enough?
  * If not pushing hard enough: people checked out/not engaged, slipping deadlines/accountability, lack of alignment.
* 3.3 Now, think about something you will do in the next week to hone your leadership skills in some small way. After you have attempted this task, please write up an analysis of your efforts and the outcome.
  * I wanted to work on my introspection, so I made a point of planning tasks in the morning, reviewing how the day went at the end and planning for the next day. I was then also able to look back over my whole week and review how things went. I think this helped me improve my prioritization and also feel less frustrated on days that felt less productive (because I could more clearly see how/where my time went instead).
* 3.4 When is it a bad idea to shield the people you lead?
  * If there is direct feedback that would be valuable for them to hear, relaying it often loses things in translation. ie hearing directly from customers about their experiences is valuable.

# Module 4: Leading Creative Teams

## Building Innovative Teams

* Who is a star?
  * not "great man theory" (seems like a form of fundamental attribution error?), instead great innovation happens in teams and networks
  * real stars: spread ideas to others, borrow ideas from others, and help others succeed
  * consider GE example: very patient if you are a low performer, but collaborative; fire quickly if you perform, but do not collaborate
* Experts, novices, and beginner's mind
  * put more faith in novices and less in experts by blending them together
  * experts are often bad at seeing old things in a new way and at changing their mind (strong ideas, strongly held)
  * if your experts are struggling to make progress, bring in others who are experts (just in a totally different subject area)
  * be wary of hiring in your own image, instead of hiring for what you don't have
* Bad apples and other negative forces
  * in best teams, "problem" members get quick negative feedback/warnings/coaching, and expell quickly if needed.
  * bad is stronger than good, "5 to 1 rule", eliminating negative is more important than accentuating positive
  * Will Felps research indicates performance is brought down by 30-40% by a single bad apple (deadbeat, downer, rude jerk, etc)
  * bad apples are both distracting and contagious. Time is spent on/around this person instead of donig the actual work.
  * main strategies: coach them, get rid of them
  * Baird CEO Paul Purcell: "During the interview, I tell them that if I discover that they are an asshole, I am going to fire them"
  * Baird CEO Paul Purcell, an asshole is someone who consistently puts their own needs in front of needs of organization, colleagues, and customers.
  * make clear goals, ensure it is clear what is non-negotiable, and enforce both
* Small and stable teams
  * J. Richard Hackman's rule - no work team should have double digit membership, performance problems increase exponentially with team size increases
  * studies seem to indicate optimal is 4.6 members (navy seal fire teams, McKinsey engagement teams are four). One in charge and 3 to execute.
  * stable membership is linked to improving team performance over time
* grok the gestalt of the team - intuitive metrics for whether innovation is succeeding
  * sense of enlightened action, people have focus/direction
  * some degree of angst, if there isn't discomfort you may not be pushing limits
  * expressing dignity, elegance, and joy

## Running Innovative Teams

* Running the Team - optimism, pessimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy
  * Innovation requires extreme optimism - reduces failure rate (probably via self-fulfilling prophecy)
  * "confidence in nonsense is required" - Burt Rutan
  * Innovation requires a few grumpy pessimists - better at finding flaws, more likely to pull the plug (overcoming sunk cost bias)
  * Negative emotions/etc are contagious/unpleasant, so though these views are good they may need to be isolated/periodically brought to bear to mitigate/limit.
  * Happy worriers may be the best of both worlds, optimistic broadly while worried about the details (Christina Wong research)
  * Building Creative Confidence - https://www.ted.com/talks/david_kelley_how_to_build_your_creative_confidence
* Money as Motivator
  * many studies show that people will work harder toward financial rewards
  * getting the rewards right is REALLY hard - see http://www.sba.oakland.edu/Faculty/york/Readings434/Readings/On%20the%20folly.pdf
    * In politics - tend to say we want detailed plans, but vote in favor of those with broad strokes.
    * In war - the organizations goal is to win, but the individuals goal is to survive. In WW2 winning meant going home, in Vietnam survining to the end of your tour meant going home.
    * In medicine - doctors can be punished for not diagnosing a sickness, but generally won't be for diagnosing when no illness exists. So they tend to overdiagnose.
    * In university - we hope professors will teach, but reward almost entirely for research and publication. Further, we value grades (rather than knowledge), which leads to grade inflation, cheating, and other degenerate behaviors.
    * In consulting - we hope for metrics of success, but those who would deliver it gain most from good reviews (and so are unlikely to look too deeply).
    * In sports - you win as a team, but are rewarded only for personal efforts (many of which may not actually help the team as much).
    * In government - basing next budget on previous rewards spending, not frugality.
    * In business - hoping for performance, while rewarding attendance
    * hope for long-term growth and environmental responsibility vs reward quarterly earnings
    * hope for teamwork vs reward individual effort
    * hope for setting challenging "stretch" objectives vs reward achieving goals and "making numbers"
    * hope for downsizing/rightsizing/delayering/restructuring vs reward for adding staff/budget
    * hope for commitment to quality vs reward for shipping on schedule
    * hope for candor and surfacing bad news early vs reward for reporting good news (regardless of truthiness) and agreeing with boss (whether or not they are correct.
    * Causes:
      * Fascination with an "Objective" Criterion - may help in highly predictable areas, but likely to cause goal displacement elsewhere.
      * Overemphasis on Highly Visible Behaviors
      * Hyprocrisy
      * Emphasis on Morality or Equity Rather than Efficiency
  * Money turns us into selfish loners.
* Intrinsic Rewards
  * Being reminded of money makes us: less likely to help others, less likely to help others, sit further apart, more likely to work alone. (Kathleen Vohs experiments)
  * autonomy/mastery/purpose (drive, daniel pink)
* Stand-up Meetings - literal, ie not sitting down during meeting.
  * Tend to be just as effective but ~34% shorter.
  * Maybe we can somewhat simulate via aggressive timeboxing, as distributed work is somewhat counter to doing this well.
* How and When to Fight - Innovation happens when people respect each other, but fight like crazy over ideas.
  * Strong opinions, weakly held.
  * Fight as if you are right, listen as if you are wrong (and teach your people to do the same)
  * Don't fight when generating ideas (ie during brainstorming)
  * Stop fighting after the decision is made, it undermines implementation (disagree and then commit)
  * "argue and decide", as long as it results in a decision it is productive, otherwise it quickly becomes toxic

## Exercises

* 4.1 For this exercise, imagine that you have been assigned to implementing changes at Microsoft to improve collaboration in ways that bolster rather than bash innovation. What are your top three suggestions? Please also explain why you have made these suggestions.
  * Remove stack ranking, and focus on reviews based on individual (including personal growth and collaboration/support, not just personal performance). Ideally we can use incentives and feedback to make the individual and the organization perform better and better over time, rather than trying to push for a local maximum of performance for a particular individual.
  * Highlight/share collaborative efforts. Make sure people are aware of those who are helping out and supporting, and the value you assign to this. Without specific focus here, this kind of work can often be relatively invisible, and without visibility it is hard to bolster/spread.
  * Carve out areas for exploration/innovation, not just profit-seeking. By putting established business expectations on the e-reader, they effectively killed it, as it really still needed to be in more of a exploration/user-acquisition, start-up like phase until it could achieve traction.
* 4.2 After reading the article on harnessing ignorance, please reflect on how you might be about to use ignorance to spark innovation in your current organization or one you might lead in the future. In a short essay, please provide your ideas, as well as an explanation of how you would go about implementing these ideas.
  * There are a few different areas that come to mind in my current organization where we have perhaps inadverdantly done some of this in pursuit of other goals, but which I think could be more productive with intention.
  * First, we recently did what we called a "beginner's mind week", where people were encouraged to take a step back/away from normal work to learn something new and collaborate with different people. Our goals were to help people make new/different connections to information as well as people. I think we missed an opportunity by not putting more of a focus on using this as a way for people to see old things in a new light though. In our survey responses after, several people did suggest they were able to do this, but we didn't really push in a way that would help it to occur (and probably ought to if/when we do this again).
  * Second, I have been trying to help provide some processes/guidelines for making and recording decisions. As part of this, during ideation it is suggested that you bring in a mix of "expert" and "novice" advisors (where they might be experts in other things, but not necessarily in the topic at hand). I did this originally with the goal in mind that the novice could point out where the details were too vague and ask for clearer context to be spelled out, but again this seems like it is missing some opportunity to ask bigger "yes, but why?" kinds of questions that the experts may be too set in their ways to truly consider.
  * Finally, your article called out something that I myself frequently fall victim to. When I'm setting out to try and do a new/different thing, my first go to action is often to research what has come before and how others have approached the problem. I still believe that is an important data point, but I definitely see how it could help to defer this until after I've given it some thought on my own (lest I fall into the trap of the local maximum defined by what others have done, instead of striking out toward some new high/low).
* 4.3 David Kelley argues that the key to leading innovative work is finding ways to instill creative confidence in people. Please watch his Ted Talk, and let us know if you agree with David or if you think he is missing something important.
  * I've certainly seen some of this. Those who identify as creative seem to give themselves permission in this realm, whereas others often shy away from it. I do with I had a bit more of an idea of how best to instill this in others though, as I fear the video didn't go into that as much. I think the permission is an important part, but I suspect in many cases it takes a bit more of a push with structure and inspiration to succeed.
* 4.4 Steven Kerr’s article provides three suggestions for how you as a boss can avoid these problems. How can you use financial incentives to yield the innovative behaviors you would like to see from your employees? Please provide a couple of examples, along with explanations.
  * I think one of the biggest challenges is finding metrics to reasonably use, especially around less visible work. One way to do this may be to focus more on relative metrics instead of absolute. So rather than provide a single rubric for all employees, provide education to managers on how to assess the current status of an employee and then compare that to their status in the future. This also helps align with a growth culture in that we hope people will continue to improve over time by adapting to feedback. Having something like this, rather than a strict ladder for promotion/advancement may better reflect the realities and also provide more flexibility instead of pushing for strict adherence to a standard that may not always apply cleanly. We could also consider bonuses/awards for particularly notable behaviors, but I'm quite wary of that reducing or removing existing intrinsic motivations.
* 4.5 While the material provided in the video is interesting, how could you actually implement these ideas in an organization? What could your boss do to make your job more intrinsically motivating? Please provide three to five ideas for each question.
  * At the org level:
    * We should increase the flexibility with which we can reward people for growing in their own way, rather than having checkpoints at which they must conform to the promotion "ladder" criteria.
    * We should ensure people have some slack in their schedules which they can actually choose what to do with in order to advance themselves.
    * We should ensure we have a clear shared identity and objectives we are moving toward such that we can feel that we are progressing toward a greater good and that we are in this together.
  * From my boss. Here I think I'm quite fortunate. I would have many, many things to say about a number of former bosses, but my present boss came along with my most recent promotion and he does a great job of supporting me/pushing me in the broad senses, while largely keeping out of the way in the nitty gritty. Sometimes I wish that I could learn some of what I'm working on more directly from him, but at the same time I appreciate his difference in perspective/knowledge as I explore various things.
* 4.6 Try calling a stand-up meeting and tell us how it worked. What are some of the keys to making such meetings effective?
  * I've done lots of standup meetings historically through my background as a developer. I actually bristled a bit at the notion here, because of the connotations it has taken on for me. As we generally didn't actually stand up, over time it came to mean for me a meeting where everyone gave a status update, and (ostensibly) pointed out blockers. The status part often felt like someone looking over your shoulder and ideally if you are blocked you will seek help immediately, rather than waiting for a meeting.
  * One of the challenges I face wrt this suggestion is that 60-70% of the engineering staff I work with is remote, so we almost always are doing our meetings in video chat. Some of us have office setups that could allow for standing, but many of us do not (which physically makes this untenable). That being said, I'm working to more aggressively establish agendas and timeboxes in meetings, which I hope will garner similar results (though this is harder, active work, rather than automagically getting ~34% reduction in time).
* 4.7 For this exercise, please provide 3-5 more ideas for running a good fight, and tell us why you suggested them.
  * Make it clear and explicit what stage of decision making something is in, and define expectations about interfacing with each level (ideation should have different expectations than deciding, and after committing to a decision expectations should be different once again).
  * After committing to a decision, schedule time in a month or so to reflect on the decision (and process) to understand if things have changed and how to do better next time. Invite anyone who may have disagreed to voice their dissent and share further input which they (ideally) have been holding back in order to prevent disrupting execution.
  * Allow degrees of buy-in to provide more feedback (ie maybe a 1-7 scale, instead of just yes/no). This is easier to review in the future to see if it has changed, and can also help people to understand if they are becoming more convincing in their arguments over time.

# Module 5: Implementation
