Scaling Excellence: How You Can Help Make it Happen

# Module 1: Course Overview

* Excellence is doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking!
* Create felt accountability: a sense of psychological ownership paired with obligation.
* Anonymity allows/creates silence.

# Module 2: Setting the Stage

## 2.1 It's a Ground War, Not an Air War

* Focus on "ground war", gaining ground slowly but surely with patience and grit.
* To succeed we need to understand how to help people at the front line and deliver the tools they need.
* You often need to slow down in order to setup for greater speed in the future.
* Identify where it is safe to fail.

### Exercise 2.1:

#### Where does my organization need to “use the brake”? What needs to be slowed down? Why?  Make a list.

* Onboarding, whether it be for individuals new to the organization, new to a role, or new to a department.
* Delivery. We deliver quickly, but not always the right things. By slowing down and reflecting more, I think we could deliver higher quality and foster growth for an overall improvement of output.
* Execution. We don't think enough about the tools we have (and lack) and how they could be invested in to drive future performance.
* Paving Golden Paths. We often desire more convergence of technologies, practices, etc, but don't invest enough in making the right things to do easy (and obvious).
* Documentation. We rush to deliver, and often don't do a good enough job explaining what we are delivering (and why) for others and for posterity.

# Module 3: The Scaling Mantras

### Scaling Mantras

1. Spread mindset not just footprint
2. Fear the clusterfug
3. Do you want to be a Catholic or a Buddhist?

## 3.1 Mindset vs Footprint

* Mindset allows footprint to thrive.
* Mindset can either emphasize what is sacred or what is taboo.
* Mindset must be action oriented: People need to know what to do without checking in with their boss. Helps if you create a clear analogy they can picture.
* Exercise: Describe mindset of your company in four words, focus on verbs or adverbs, don't use nouns like integrity (too abstract)

### Exercise 2.1

#### Describe the mindset of your company in four words.

Deepen customer relationships.

## 3.2 Pen, Price Tag, and Flashlight to Create Mindset

Tools for managing chaotic marketplaces where lots of individuals repeatedly make short-term commitments to do business with one another.

* Pen: Write a rule. Best for big picture stuff, simple affirmations of first principles. Can provide structure and basic plumbing in place. Can be overdone, can be costly to enforce.
* Price Tag: Add cost or subsidy to influence behavior. Best to channel, sort, and manage.
* Flashlight: Give transparency and apply focus on something. Steer behavior by highlighting outliers.

Described as leaning into human nature, in opposition to command and control.

## 3.3 Managing Clusterfugs

### Causes of Clusterfugs

* Illusion: Mistaken assumptions on the part of decision makers
* Impatience: Wanting to do it quicker and faster
* Incompetence: The people who are involved are not the right ones

* For leaders, understanding how the organization works, and understanding how it is to work for them are two very different things.
* Need to recognize where it is ok to fail (and you can hit the gas), vs where we need to get it right (and it's worth hitting the breaks).

### Exercise 3.2

#### Think of a specific Clusterfug your company has experienced. Can you find any evidence for illusion, impatience, or incompetence? What could have been done to avoid it? What methods could you use to solve them?

When we undertook to build out a new product recently, we ran into a number of these problems. A small group of senior folks were pulled out of their normal places to focus around this. Over time this meant they lost access to more diverse perspectives and fell out of touch with customer needs. In this state, they made a number of decisions that seemed to discount the challenge, risk, and cost of their proposed solution. The outcome was a plan of attack, with an aggressive timeline, that was then rolled out to the larger organization (who had largely not had opportunity to participate creating the plan). All in all it sounds very much inline with these hallmarks.

I think this could have been avoided by involving a broader group of people earlier in the discussions to help ground the effort in reality and provide clearer analysis of cost/risk/etc. The decisions that were made also could have better explained why they were chosen to equip implementors to participate. Finally, a longer deadline (or more conservative feature set) would have helped.

## 3.4 Buddhism vs Catholicism: Choosing a Path

* Avoid replication traps caused by delusions of uniqueness.
* These are two ends of a spectrum, which organizations often try to resolve by doing both (Buddholic).
* Real challenge is figuring out when to choose one and when to choose the other.

### Exercise 3.3

#### Assume you have 100 points. How many of those points would you allocate to Catholicism? How many to Buddhism?

I would lean more heavily toward Buddhism, with some more Catholic leaning guardrails. Probably something like 80/20, but maybe even 90/10.

#### Where in your organization do you need to be Catholic? Why?

We need to be consistent where there are external factors (like compliance or contracts) that impose that requirement. We also need to be consistent in boundary crossing situations, like things that are between teams, or between a team and customers. Ideally, we could move toward this in a number of other situations to reduce duplication, but sometimes these distinctions are valuable (either directly or at least by virtue of instilling ownership).

#### Where do you need to be Buddhist? Why?

Within teams, we should try to give as much leeway as possible to allow them to apply their deeper knowledge and nearer context to figure out the best approach for them. Leaving teams to reach their own conclusions allows them to have more ownership, as well as providing opportunity to innovate by finding novel solutions. We should still give feedback, and highlight successes though, to combat uniqueness that is not of value.

# Module 4: Applying Scaling Principles

## 4.1 Link Hot Causes to Cool Solutions

* Name either the problem or the enemy, then tell a story.
* How to choose a story:
  * If you face a real threat, focus on that. If there is no threat, don't construct one.
  * If you have a choice, focus on the style of the top managers and remember the DNA of the organization.
* Making a rational argument often falls short, think about how to emotionally involve people.
* If you want to scale, do you start by trying to change behavior or trying to change belief?
* Cool Solutions = Insurgent, unconventional solutions.
* Getting public commitment drives continued commitment.
* Teaching something helps you internalize/learn it (and publicly commits).

### Emotional Grid

Need to move from weak to strong to elicit response/action.

1. Weak Negative - Resignation Zone
2. Weak Positive - Comfort Zone
3. Strong Negative - Aggression zone (kill the dragon) - Anger
4. Strong Positive - Passion zone (win the princess) - Pride

### Exercise 4.1

#### Think about your own organization or unit. Are you in the comfort zone or the resignation zone? Explain why.

I feel like resignation is probably more fitting at present. Through acquisitions and more recently reorgs, we have a pretty disparate group of individuals who see one another as other and potential enemy as much as they see external threats.

#### Would it be more appropriate to move the organization into the passion zone or the aggression zone? Why?

I think the passion zone would be much more fitting. I don't really think there is a good existing enemy to rally against, and as the leader I'm way more comfortable leading toward passion.

#### Design a short and simple story that will help move your organization or unit into the passion or resignation zone.

Never Alone. We have much more in common than we have holding us apart. Whether in success or failure, we have your back and will work together.

#### What cool solutions can you apply to your story?

I'm working to create a number of informal contexts in which people can chat and get to know one another better (which makes it hard to still fear/other), as well as contexts where they can share challenges and opportunities more broadly.  I'm working hard to model the behaviors I want to see publicly for the group. And I'm considering if it would make sense to do some kind of public pledge, but haven't worked out details yet.

## 4.2 Cut Cognitive Load

* Excessive cognitive load undermines the ability of people to do what they know and believe they should.
* Willpower is a limited resource, if we use it up on the wrong things, we won't have enough left for the right things.
* Take care not to just add things. Stripping things back and keeping them simple keeps cognitive load low.
* Reducing load creates goodwill. Get rid of meetings, sunset reports, simplify approvals, etc. This shows you care, and especially B&C players will pay you back.
* Dropbox meeting-geddon. Remove all non-client meetings, no new recurring meetings allowed for 2 weeks (with caution around who you include, permission to raise hand and ask to be excused, etc)

### Exercise 4.2

#### In what ways does your company experience excessive cognitive load? In what ways can you reduce cognitive load? What can you subtract?

I think we have too many meetings, with too many people, and not enough clarity of agenda/goals. They seem to be the defacto way to communicate, as well as one of the key ways to gain visibility, while not being very effective at either.

I think we could improve on this in a few ways. First, we can be more strategic about who is in a given meeting, reducing the total number of participants and therefore freeing up the time of others. Second, we can provide other forums for visibility, so that we don't fall back on meetings out of a hunger for this. Finally, we could be more strict about cancelling and/or reducing the recurrence of meetings that do not have clear agendas and consistent progress.
