Scaling Excellence: How You Can Help Make it Happen

# Module 1: Course Overview

* Excellence is doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking!
* Create felt accountability: a sense of psychological ownership paired with obligation.
* Anonymity allows/creates silence.

# Module 2: Setting the Stage

## 2.1 It's a Ground War, Not an Air War

* Focus on "ground war", gaining ground slowly but surely with patience and grit.
* To succeed we need to understand how to help people at the front line and deliver the tools they need.
* You often need to slow down in order to setup for greater speed in the future.
* Identify where it is safe to fail.

### Exercise 2.1:

#### Where does my organization need to “use the brake”? What needs to be slowed down? Why?  Make a list.

* Onboarding, whether it be for individuals new to the organization, new to a role, or new to a department.
* Delivery. We deliver quickly, but not always the right things. By slowing down and reflecting more, I think we could deliver higher quality and foster growth for an overall improvement of output.
* Execution. We don't think enough about the tools we have (and lack) and how they could be invested in to drive future performance.
* Paving Golden Paths. We often desire more convergence of technologies, practices, etc, but don't invest enough in making the right things to do easy (and obvious).
* Documentation. We rush to deliver, and often don't do a good enough job explaining what we are delivering (and why) for others and for posterity.

# Module 3: The Scaling Mantras

### Scaling Mantras

1. Spread mindset not just footprint
2. Fear the clusterfug
3. Do you want to be a Catholic or a Buddhist?

## 3.1 Mindset vs Footprint

* Mindset allows footprint to thrive.
* Mindset can either emphasize what is sacred or what is taboo.
* Mindset must be action oriented: People need to know what to do without checking in with their boss. Helps if you create a clear analogy they can picture.
* Exercise: Describe mindset of your company in four words, focus on verbs or adverbs, don't use nouns like integrity (too abstract)

### Exercise 2.1

#### Describe the mindset of your company in four words.

Deepen customer relationships.

## 3.2 Pen, Price Tag, and Flashlight to Create Mindset

Tools for managing chaotic marketplaces where lots of individuals repeatedly make short-term commitments to do business with one another.

* Pen: Write a rule. Best for big picture stuff, simple affirmations of first principles. Can provide structure and basic plumbing in place. Can be overdone, can be costly to enforce.
* Price Tag: Add cost or subsidy to influence behavior. Best to channel, sort, and manage.
* Flashlight: Give transparency and apply focus on something. Steer behavior by highlighting outliers.

Described as leaning into human nature, in opposition to command and control.

## 3.3 Managing Clusterfugs

### Causes of Clusterfugs

* Illusion: Mistaken assumptions on the part of decision makers
* Impatience: Wanting to do it quicker and faster
* Incompetence: The people who are involved are not the right ones

* For leaders, understanding how the organization works, and understanding how it is to work for them are two very different things.
* Need to recognize where it is ok to fail (and you can hit the gas), vs where we need to get it right (and it's worth hitting the breaks).

### Exercise 3.2

#### Think of a specific Clusterfug your company has experienced. Can you find any evidence for illusion, impatience, or incompetence? What could have been done to avoid it? What methods could you use to solve them?

When we undertook to build out a new product recently, we ran into a number of these problems. A small group of senior folks were pulled out of their normal places to focus around this. Over time this meant they lost access to more diverse perspectives and fell out of touch with customer needs. In this state, they made a number of decisions that seemed to discount the challenge, risk, and cost of their proposed solution. The outcome was a plan of attack, with an aggressive timeline, that was then rolled out to the larger organization (who had largely not had opportunity to participate creating the plan). All in all it sounds very much inline with these hallmarks.

I think this could have been avoided by involving a broader group of people earlier in the discussions to help ground the effort in reality and provide clearer analysis of cost/risk/etc. The decisions that were made also could have better explained why they were chosen to equip implementors to participate. Finally, a longer deadline (or more conservative feature set) would have helped.

## 3.4 Buddhism vs Catholicism: Choosing a Path

* Avoid replication traps caused by delusions of uniqueness.
* These are two ends of a spectrum, which organizations often try to resolve by doing both (Buddholic).
* Real challenge is figuring out when to choose one and when to choose the other.

### Exercise 3.3

#### Assume you have 100 points. How many of those points would you allocate to Catholicism? How many to Buddhism?

I would lean more heavily toward Buddhism, with some more Catholic leaning guardrails. Probably something like 80/20, but maybe even 90/10.

#### Where in your organization do you need to be Catholic? Why?

We need to be consistent where there are external factors (like compliance or contracts) that impose that requirement. We also need to be consistent in boundary crossing situations, like things that are between teams, or between a team and customers. Ideally, we could move toward this in a number of other situations to reduce duplication, but sometimes these distinctions are valuable (either directly or at least by virtue of instilling ownership).

#### Where do you need to be Buddhist? Why?

Within teams, we should try to give as much leeway as possible to allow them to apply their deeper knowledge and nearer context to figure out the best approach for them. Leaving teams to reach their own conclusions allows them to have more ownership, as well as providing opportunity to innovate by finding novel solutions. We should still give feedback, and highlight successes though, to combat uniqueness that is not of value.

# Module 4: Applying Scaling Principles

## 4.1 Link Hot Causes to Cool Solutions

* Name either the problem or the enemy, then tell a story.
* How to choose a story:
  * If you face a real threat, focus on that. If there is no threat, don't construct one.
  * If you have a choice, focus on the style of the top managers and remember the DNA of the organization.
* Making a rational argument often falls short, think about how to emotionally involve people.
* If you want to scale, do you start by trying to change behavior or trying to change belief?
* Cool Solutions = Insurgent, unconventional solutions.
* Getting public commitment drives continued commitment.
* Teaching something helps you internalize/learn it (and publicly commits).

### Emotional Grid

Need to move from weak to strong to elicit response/action.

1. Weak Negative - Resignation Zone
2. Weak Positive - Comfort Zone
3. Strong Negative - Aggression zone (kill the dragon) - Anger
4. Strong Positive - Passion zone (win the princess) - Pride

### Exercise 4.1

#### Think about your own organization or unit. Are you in the comfort zone or the resignation zone? Explain why.

I feel like resignation is probably more fitting at present. Through acquisitions and more recently reorgs, we have a pretty disparate group of individuals who see one another as other and potential enemy as much as they see external threats.

#### Would it be more appropriate to move the organization into the passion zone or the aggression zone? Why?

I think the passion zone would be much more fitting. I don't really think there is a good existing enemy to rally against, and as the leader I'm way more comfortable leading toward passion.

#### Design a short and simple story that will help move your organization or unit into the passion or resignation zone.

Never Alone. We have much more in common than we have holding us apart. Whether in success or failure, we have your back and will work together.

#### What cool solutions can you apply to your story?

I'm working to create a number of informal contexts in which people can chat and get to know one another better (which makes it hard to still fear/other), as well as contexts where they can share challenges and opportunities more broadly.  I'm working hard to model the behaviors I want to see publicly for the group. And I'm considering if it would make sense to do some kind of public pledge, but haven't worked out details yet.

## 4.2 Cut Cognitive Load

* Excessive cognitive load undermines the ability of people to do what they know and believe they should.
* Willpower is a limited resource, if we use it up on the wrong things, we won't have enough left for the right things.
* Take care not to just add things. Stripping things back and keeping them simple keeps cognitive load low.
* Reducing load creates goodwill. Get rid of meetings, sunset reports, simplify approvals, etc. This shows you care, and especially B&C players will pay you back.
* Dropbox meeting-geddon. Remove all non-client meetings, no new recurring meetings allowed for 2 weeks (with caution around who you include, permission to raise hand and ask to be excused, etc)

### Exercise 4.2

#### In what ways does your company experience excessive cognitive load? In what ways can you reduce cognitive load? What can you subtract?

I think we have too many meetings, with too many people, and not enough clarity of agenda/goals. They seem to be the defacto way to communicate, as well as one of the key ways to gain visibility, while not being very effective at either.

I think we could improve on this in a few ways. First, we can be more strategic about who is in a given meeting, reducing the total number of participants and therefore freeing up the time of others. Second, we can provide other forums for visibility, so that we don't fall back on meetings out of a hunger for this. Finally, we could be more strict about cancelling and/or reducing the recurrence of meetings that do not have clear agendas and consistent progress.

## 4.3 Increase Felt Accountability

* Felt Accountability - The place owns me, but I own the place too. Tug of obligation and commitment.
* Think about Maslow Heirarchy, and focus on providing intrinsic motivations. Help people see their impact and it's relation to purpose.
* Find mission-driven focus and use it to help prioritize and drive decision making.
* Hiring is a tool for felt accountability
  * Hire employees who are pre-wired to be accountable
  * Use another organization as your HR department
  * Engineer your gene pool to build excellence
  * Create seed organizations
  * Get poor performers out
  * Divide organization into smaller sub units
* Hiring: Ninja (ace performers at core duties) vs Jedi (independent, don't wait for instructions, fix it themselves) vs Pirate (question rules and norms)
* Hire people that match the mindset (what is sacred, what is taboo), then guide them to behaviors that reenforce and demonstrate their beliefs.
* Recruiting, talent development/management is one of the most valuable things we can do (so we should allocate time/resources to it).
* After promotion/advancement, it hurts the company (and individual) if they simply go on doing their old job.
* Juicing behavior wth incentives - once you establish mindset, ensure there are things that sustain and grow them
  * can be subtle/subliminal queues
  * money as a tool (when linked to emotion, otherwise it is more like a drug)
    * low economic magnitude, low psychological magnitude - much ado about nothing
    * low economic magnitude, high psychological magnitude - great bang for buck (immediacy, reversibility, recognition unanticipated)
    * high economic magnitude, low psychological magnitude - little bang for buck
    * high economic magnitude, high psychological magnitude - high-powered incentives
* incentives and innovation
  * focus more on killing ideas, rather than creating them

### Exercise 4.3

#### Think about the examples provided by Chip Conley, the other scaling experts, and of the story of the Taj Hotels. What lessons can you learn that apply to your organization or unit? How can felt accountability be created amongst the employees in your organization or unit?

I think we could do much more to invite people to make a call and move something forward with confidence, instead of waiting for permission and/or someone else to decide. We can't and shouldn't do this in all situations, but I fear we do it in far too few at present. This would help with the sense of ownership of output. On the other side, I think we need to build a tighter network of people who feel accountable to support one another to provide a stronger sense of obligation as well.

#### Provide an example of a successful team you were a part of. What were some ways the team exemplified talent density and felt accountability?

One of the best teams I was on was our "core" team. We knew almost everyone else depended on us, and took great pride in consistently delivering value. At the same time, we were sure to also clean up old stuff and continue to refine our own system (even when others wouldn't directly see the value).

### Exercise 4.3

#### How does what you have learned about accountability relate to the hiring practices in your own organization or unit? Describe some of your current hiring practices. What are some things that are done well today? What are some things that you might improve to create more felt accountability?

One of our major challenges is that we do a lot of our major growth via acquisition. This has many benefits, but one of the downsides is that we get many employees together. This limits our ability to pick and choose, and brings a more establish and self-reinforcing culture in to the mix. I think we need to do more to help this diaspora to feel they are now in a shared, collaborative context in which they can rely on one another and in which they are working toward the same goals. Presently it often feels too much as though we are loosely affiliated but working on our own projects toward our own ends.

#### In reflecting about the types of employees that your organization needs to hire for, are there specific types of employees to add to your team? Should you be looking for ninjas, Jedi’s, or pirates? Why?

I think we are getting high performing people, so the ninjas part seems somewhat of a given. I don' think we are getting nearly enough Jedi though, or are losing that along the way if we start with it. I also think we could use some more (but not too many) pirates to help keep us honest and iterating.

## 4.4 Connect and Cascade

* Lack of connections lead to ignorance, which rapidly increases propensity to make mistakes.
* Designing Cascades for Excellence
  * One to one: ie Mentoring
  * One to Many: ie Hayden Fry and the Bell Cow (recruiting and coaching those that others look to)
  * Many to Few: Navy Seal Teams, many connections from one team to others
  * Many to Many: Intuit's Design for Delight. Pain Storm - what are the pains. Solution Jam - brainstorm solutions. Code Jam - Implement solutions.
* To spread excellence, you need to have excellence to spread.
* Use all five senses, where possible, to subtly prime effort.
  * communicate mindset - ie posting pictures of children in schools to remind of the mission
  * trigger felt accountability without increasing load - ie people cheat more in darker rooms than in brighter rooms
  * juice effort - ie red primes warning/caution, blue primes possibility/ocean/etc
* Tips on How to Use Subtle Cues
  * Harness metaphors - ie describing crime as a beast vs crime as a virus
  * Prime automatic effort through pictures - ie seeing pictures of elderly cause people to walk slower, seeing library pictures cause people to speak more softly
  * Touch employees through five senses - ie receiving hot coffee vs cold coffee from an experimenter, thought differently about the experimenter
  * Signage as a cue - ie shooting stars on pavement where people had died. Also mimes demonstrating crossing behavior, jeering at bad behaving drivers, etc.
  * Space as a cue
* Publish everything to attract (and create) talent.

### Exercise 4.5

#### What kinds of subtle cues is your organization currently using? What senses are they targeting?

Within our offices we have many pictures of the customers that we are driving impact to and their engagement with our company. We also have a lot of our brand permeating the way the office is laid out.

#### What other cues could be put in place to scale excellence?

Given the current context (all of us remote), this seems significantly harder. There are fewer opportunities for serendipity and subtlety that can "just happen" when people are collocated. I think we can still make some choices in how we run remote meetings and structure communications, but it seems much harder to do this with subtlety. Additionally, in the remote context it's hard to access things other than sight and hearing, and even then it's hard to not be pretty blatant/explicit about it.

### Exercise 4.6

#### What are some mechanisms you could use in your organization to ensure people share their mistakes and successes and other useful information with each other?

I'm working on creating a weekly meeting with myself and a rotating set of others that will hopefully meet some of this need. In the meeting each participant will share something that has gone well (or poorly) with everyone else. Then we'll ask each in turn what they could use help with. As a participant I will be able to model the behavior, and also have a chance to hear all the other reports, which I can then compile and look for trends/patterns of things to address, as well as using my broader knowledge to make pertinent connections between people that could help one another. At a higher level, as patterns and lessons emerge, I'll also be broadcasting these more broadly (either directly, or by facilitating presentations from the originators, depending on context/situation/etc).

#### What are some important stories that newcomers should hear as they get on-boarded? How do these help explain and teach the mindset of your organization?

I think newcomers could really benefit from hearing how others have navigated the organization and what they've learned along the way. They should hear stories of how we collaborate and support one another in good times and bad. And finally they should hear stories of iterative improvement, both of the product and of ourselves.

## 4.5 Bad is Stronger Than Good

* negativity bias: bad interactions are about 5x more impactful/memorable than good interactions
* emphasize ongoing iteration, we should always be looking for further opportunities
* one of the biggest challenges in rooting out bad behavior is understanding the underlying motivations
* [Taking the Mystery Out of Scaling](https://a16z.com/2010/08/02/taking-the-mystery-out-of-scaling-a-company/)
  * Three things become big challenges as you grow: communication, common knowledge, and decision making.
  * Give ground grudgingly. Specialization, organizational structure, and process complicate things but can prevent a descent into chaos.
  * Organizational design provides communications architecture. Basic steps:
    * Figure out  what needs communicated
    * Figure out what needs to be decided, and how can you maximize the number of decisions in the domain of a designated manager
    * Prioritize the most important communication and decision paths
    * Decide who will run each group (the focus should be the communicators, not the managers, so this comes after above steps)
    * Identify the paths you did not optimize, and have a plan to address them if they become problematic
  * Process replaces ad hoc, point-to-point communications with a bus.
    * It should scale to match the needs of the challenge it facilitates.
    * Helps ensure that the communication happens, and that it happens with quality.
    * Process should be designed by those already doing the work.
    * See Also: Chapter 1: The Basics of Production from Andy Grove's High Output Management
      * Focus on output first
      * Figure out how you'll know if you are getting what you want at each step
      * Engineer accountability into the system

### Exercise 4.7

#### What is the broken window in your organization?  How are you going to fix it?

Within the architects group that I work with, one of the biggest problems is a combination of too many disparate responsibilities and not enough support. Individuals feel stretched thin and can't imagine how they could take on anything else. I think we need to recognize that all those responsibilities do need to be accounted for, but not every individual needs to attend to every single responsibility. By coordinating and trading, we can allocate more efficiently, and hopefully better pair people with things that they are good at (and/or want to grow their skill in). As an example, we have a lot of meetings that have way too many participants, and taking a moment to step back and consider how much new/different perspective each additional one actually adds might quickly free up a lot of people.

### Exercise 4.8

#### What is an instance in your organization or unit where bad behaviors took over? How was this dealt with?

I think we have some learned helplessness issues within the architecture organization, which unfortunately I don't think we have yet dealt with.

#### What processes would be effective in your organization for eliminating bad behavior and clearing the way for excellence?

I believe we need to invite architects to participate, probably repeatedly and at a regular cadence. We don't want them to feel they need to sit back and wait for guidance or answers, when they can help define where we are going. Presently, people feel quite overwhelmed and isolated, and don't feel they can take on anything else. To address the isolation, I think we need to be intentional and explicit about connecting people. Furthermore, wherever we can we should get allies to share what is working for them and for colleagues to offer help to one another to provide role models and social pressure. As more help is offered and received, it should hopefully reduce some overwhelm and isolation, and I hope we can then add some ongoing reflection and iteration to individuals regular schedules. My hope is that if we get people to regularly reflect on how things are going, hypothesize changes that might help, and then test them, we can bit by bit dig out of this hole.

#### What are some challenges you have faced when trying to manage bad behaviors, particularly across differing cultures? How have you addressed these challenges, or how could you address them in the future?

As various things are tried and time passes, I've found many colleagues develop a high degree of cynicism. Coupled with overwhelm, it can be very hard to get them to give a new effort a chance when they feel like it's yet-another-ask on their time that they deem likely to fail (as everything else seeming has). I think it is important in this context to focus, at least initially, on the natural allies who are less cynical and more open to trying new things. Doing everything that can be done to ensure they are successful, and that their success is public, loud and obvious. As others see the transformation and success, it is more likely they'll give it a chance and/or be swept up in it as you roll the process out more broadly.

# Module 5: Parting Points

## Scaling in Practice: Using Premortems

* Framing an outcome as being certain helps us focus our thinking and allows us to bring up things that are otherwise unmentioned (or unmentionable).
* Provides an opportunity to organize doubt while also building confidence.
* Help overcome the Abilene Paradox (someone suggests chili in Texas summer, others say it's a great idea to not rock the boat, but once the chili has been had nobody is really happy).

* Randomly divide into groups (less than 10 members). Ask half to imagine initiave failed, and half to imagine it succeeded.
* Each individual should write a story (~ 1 page) that describes how the failure or success occured.
  * Include all the events that culminated in the outcome (not just a list of factors), should be kind of like a flowchart with this leading to that, etc.
  * 1-pager provides a constraint, where people will write most about what they care about most or know about most.
* Pool pre-mortems for failure into a flow-chart of events leading to failure. Do the same for success.
* Gather a group of people, present the premortems (probably success first, then failure).
  * Split the group up into subgroups (less than 10 members each), and ask each subgroup to focus on one thing they felt that they will stop doing.

## Parting Thoughts

* Things will often be challenging in the present, and we often only see/realize success once it is over.
* The present is often messy, but time shifting can help:
  * Acknowledge things are messed up, but point to times in the past where people banded together to overcome similar situations.
  * Paint a picture of how great things will be in the future.
* Excellence is when people do the right thing, even when nobody is looking.
  * Mindset allows your footprint to survive and thrive.
  * Do you want to be Buddhist, Catholic, or Buddholic?
  * Use Pre-Mortems to avoid clusterfugs.
* Before you ask people to do more, give them a gift (this can help get more out of B and C players), this gives early progress and garners goodwill.
  * Fix Broken Windows
  * Reduce Cognitive Load
* A level players will feel that fixes are a requirement (they could go somewhere else), whereas B and C level players will appreciate and reward these efforts.

### Exercise 5.1

#### Think of a scaling project you are currently working on. Write a pre-mortem story related to that effort. Share it here and feel free to also share on the course forum. As an option, you can also do the pre-mortem exercise with a team. 

Our architecture group went from an ad hoc collective to an organized community. Our community supports one another in their work, as well as in their growth and development. Onboarding is provided for new members, as well as other members serving as both giver and receiver of coaching, with learning rounded out through classes and books. Though we are generally not organized, we come together in to small teams as needed to help push through more challenging projects, before returning to our loose affiliation style. Through this networking, we are better able to improve the impact and efficacy of individuals, as well as increasing consistency and reducing duplicative effort, in order to deliver better support to the rest of the organization.

Taking the opposite view.

Our efforts to create community within architects were ultimately unsuccessful. We struggled to reduce cognitive load sufficiently to allow people time/space to pay attention, and good will to push through the failures as well as successes. Too many individuals remained skeptical, and without their buy-in we failed to reach a large enough portion of participation to create the network effects that may otherwise have sustained a community. Furthermore, as efforts continued without sufficient progress, many grew increasingly cynical, making subsequent efforts progressively harder to get traction for.

#### What was the effect of looking back from the future?

It does seem to provide some psychological distancing to try and see things with more perspective. In the current moment, I feel anxious about how best to move this forward and what things I should prioritize. I think looking back, it gave me more of a sense of hopefulness that it could arrive at something could in time. It also provides some sobering thoughts about particular traps/areas of concern that I must find a way to address though. I think doing a better job of not just offering programs, but trying to carefully explain why I think they are of value may help to get buy-in, but cognitive load reduction may still need to be found/delivered first.

#### Choose 2-3 scaling principles or mantras that you found to be most relevant to you and your organization. What are they? Please describe 3-5 tangible actions you will take in order to follow these principles.

I think the notion of Buddhist vs Catholic was helpful, it helps give me language for some of the things I have been fighting with/against. I tend to lean more toward Buddhist, whereas I think the organization is often more Catholic. I think this will help me to better communicate the differences, and also pushes me to be clarify the guard rail non-negotiables that can keep us all on track.

Ground war also is a helpful reminder. It's easy to become impatient with these things, but this helps ground me (and remind me that impatience is also to be avoided as one of the big leading indicators of an upcoming clusterfug). I hope this will help remind me to look for some ways to ensure there is progress happening that can be shared/highlighted, but also an acceptance that it may sometimes be quite small indeed.

Finally, I think the cut cognitive load/fix broken windows ideas are also good reminders. Focusing on these streamlining things to provide a quality of life improvement as well as garnering early good will, seem like a great way to get things moving in the right direction.
