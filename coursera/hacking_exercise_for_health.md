# Hacking Exercise for Health

## Intervals

* A majority of the exercise benefit is seen from the first set, though further sets can help optimize.
  * It's much better to do something (anything) than nothing.
* High intensity seems to matter more that duration, weight, etc in terms of overall efficacy.

## Cardio

* vo2max is the main way to measure cardio fitness, as it shows how well you exchange oxygen. Can be measured with Rockport walk test:
  * male vo2max = 145.486 - (0.388 * age) - (0.077 * weight in lbs) - (3.265 * time to walk a mile in minutes) - (0.156 * heart rate after walk)
  * female vo2max = 139.168 - (0.388 * age) - (0.077 * weight in lbs) - (3.265 * time to walk a mile in minutes) - (0.156 * heart rate after walk)
* high intensity causes both slow and fast twitch to be recruited, burning more energy in less time.
* high intensity burns fewer calories during workout, but results in a larger and longer increase in metabolism over time, netting a similar total calorie burn
* research tested HIIT protocols (easiest to hardest):
  * interval walking - ~60m - 10 repititions of 3 minutes easy walking and 3 minutes hard walking (about 3/10 difficulty)
  * 10x1 - ~20m - 10 repititions of 1 minute hard effort and 1 minute rest.
  * 1 minute workout - ~10m - 3 repititions of 20s highest effort and 3 minute steady slower pace.

## Musculoskeletal

* Muscles that can generate more force fatigue sooner, and vice versa.
* Initial strength gains come from enhanced coordination/recruitment of muscle fibers, later gains come from growth/hypertrophy.
* Total weight and/or reps don't seem to matter as much as effort. Work to fatigue (and if this takes more than 30 reps, increase difficulty)w
* Ensure you get enough protein to allow you to outweigh muscle breakdown. Max usable is ~1.6g/kg/day.
* Mix: push, pull, core, and legs
* When sequencing, start with more complex movements that work more muscle groups, then move toward more isolated movements. Also, move between different types to avoid overtaxing any one area.
* Beginner: squat, push up, pull up, plank.
* FIIT: Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type (first three are most important)

## Bringing it Together

* Can combine cardio and strength by limiting breaks and keeping intensity high. ie Tabata, 7m workout, etc
* Key Principles of programming:
  * Combination - high frequency with few breaks to combine strength and cardio
  * Variation - move between different muscle groups to avoid overtaking any one
  * Effort - should maintain 8 or 9 out of 10 difficulty throughout
  * Progression - as difficulty decreases, move to more difficult variations
* Exercise also helps with focus, mood, and other benefits.
* The key is doing something consistently.
