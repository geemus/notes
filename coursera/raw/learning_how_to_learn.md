# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects

## Week 1

* Learn by alternating between diffuse (new, loose, relative) and focused (old, tight, particular) over time.
* After focused training, you need time to recover/consolidate, similar to exercise.
* Pomodoro - 25 minutes of uninterrupted focus, then a reward.
* The more abstract something is, the more practice is needed to build and strengthen neural pathways.
* Focused learning utilizing working memory, which only has about 4 chunks of memory, and needs repitition to keep things in focus.
* Long term memory needs to be revisited a number of times, otherwise the access patterns will not be reenforced enough to find the memory again.
* Spaced repitition reenforces access patterns in long term memory to support finding ideas again.
* During sleep, brain washes away toxins, removes inactive patterns, and repeats/reenforces active patterns.
* Reviewing materials just before sleep and/or having an intention to dream about something makes it more likely that you will do so, and can enhance learning.
