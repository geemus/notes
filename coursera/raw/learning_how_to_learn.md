# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects

## Week 1

* Learn by alternating between diffuse (new, loose, relative) and focused (old, tight, particular) over time.
* After focused training, you need time to recover/consolidate, similar to exercise.
* Pomodoro - 25 minutes of uninterrupted focus, then a reward.
* The more abstract something is, the more practice is needed to build and strengthen neural pathways.
* Focused learning utilizing working memory, which only has about 4 chunks of memory, and needs repitition to keep things in focus.
* Long term memory needs to be revisited a number of times, otherwise the access patterns will not be reenforced enough to find the memory again.
* Spaced repitition reenforces access patterns in long term memory to support finding ideas again.
* During sleep, brain washes away toxins, removes inactive patterns, and repeats/reenforces active patterns.
* Reviewing materials just before sleep and/or having an intention to dream about something makes it more likely that you will do so, and can enhance learning.

## Week 2

* Chunks are thoughts bound together through meaning or use.
* Allows a focus on the core idea, instead of needing to retrieve all the underlying nitty gritty. Initially a new idea takes all working memory, but a chunk can stand in and use only a portion of working memory to represent the same idea.
* Steps to chunking:
  * Focus entirely on the new material, using all available working memory.
  * Synthesize an understanding of the basic idea or action.
  * Practice/Repitition to verify understanding and re-enforce memory. Deliberately focus on what you find more difficult.

* Contextualize the new idea, figuring out where the chunk (bottom-up) meets the big picture (top-down). Chunking teachs how to do something, context tells us when to use it instead of another technique.

* Recall - test your memory/understanding by trying to recall what was learned
  * Retrieval builds stronger connections/memory.
  * Allows practice of understanding.
  * Provides a context to make mistakes that can be learned from.
  * Helps overcome illusion of competence, where we believe we understand it more fully than we actually do.
  * Recalling in different contexts and situations can help you to more broadly contextualize.

* Bill Gates and others, active reading weeks to build chunks.

* Transfer - when consolidating one chunk, it often may shed additional light on other chunks.
* Compaction - over time, chunks can grow more complex and relate to more things.
* Start to build not just knowledge, by types of knowledge, which help build new and different kinds of chunks.
* By adding more chunks, further chunks become easier because there are more opportunities for interrelation.

* Overlearning - continuing after you have learned all you can in a particular session.
  * Can be a waste of time, unless automaticity is the goal.
  * Can be avoided by taking care to focus on the harder things that you know less well, rather than focusing on what may already be easy.
* Einstellung - getting stuck in initial impressions and/or familiar ways of thinking, rather than revising it as more is learned. (blocked thoughts due to preceeding training)
* Interleaving - once you have the basic idea down, explore different ideas/types/procedures that are related to understand not just how something might work, but when to use it. Builds ability to be creative.
