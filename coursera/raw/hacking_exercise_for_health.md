# Hacking Exercise for Health. The surprising new science of fitness.

## Week 1: Basics of Fitness

* cardiorespritory fitness - ability to move oxygen through the body
* musculoskeletal fitness - strength/endurance/power from progressive muscular overload
* exercise continuum - strength (low rep, high intensity) to endurance (high rep and/or high duration)
* we respond to stress by adapting in a way that will reduce the amount of stress we would have if this same stress recurred
* In order to increase strength, probably need to do greater than 60% 1 rep maximum
* Studies indicate that most benefit comes from first set (both cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal), more sets are needed to maximize but one set can be used as an optimization.
* Main hack: do something, as the first part gives the majority of the benefit
