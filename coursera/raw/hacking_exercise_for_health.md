# Hacking Exercise for Health. The surprising new science of fitness.

## Week 1: Basics of Fitness

* cardiorespritory fitness - ability to move oxygen through the body
* musculoskeletal fitness - strength/endurance/power from progressive muscular overload
* exercise continuum - strength (low rep, high intensity) to endurance (high rep and/or high duration)
* we respond to stress by adapting in a way that will reduce the amount of stress we would have if this same stress recurred
* In order to increase strength, probably need to do greater than 60% 1 rep maximum
* Studies indicate that most benefit comes from first set (both cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal), more sets are needed to maximize but one set can be used as an optimization.
* Main hack: do something, as the first part gives the majority of the benefit

## Week 2: Cardiorespiratory Fitness

* vo2max is measure of how much oxygen you breath in vs how much you breath out (ie how efficient you can excange oxygen)
* Rockport walk test:
  * male vo2max = 145.486 - (0.388 * age) - (0.077 * weight in lbs) - (3.265 * time to walk a mile in minutes) - (0.156 * heart rate after walk)
  * female vo2max = 139.168 - (0.388 * age) - (0.077 * weight in lbs) - (3.265 * time to walk a mile in minutes) - (0.156 * heart rate after walk)
* common recommendation is 150 minutes of moderate intensity steady state (not quite breaking a sweat, able to speak, but not sing)
* HIIT: many different regimes, but focus on high intensity for short burts, rather than steady state
* one minute workout: 3 hard 20 second sprints within 10 minutes
* endurance training would deplete energy reserves over time
* interval training depletes energy reserves at a higher rate by recruiting both fast and slow twitch muscles, which seems to have a comparable impact
* endurance burns more calories during exercise, but fewer afterward during recovery. interval burns fewer during exercise, but more afterward. Between the two, similar burns result over the course of the day.
* HIIT protocols from research (easiest to hardest)
  * interval walking - easier 3 minute walk, then harder 3 minute (about 3/10 difficulty), repeate 10x (60m)
  * 10x1 - minute of hard effort, minute of rest, repeat 10x (20m)
  * 1 minute workout - 20s intense, 3m steady, repeat 3x (~10m + warmup&cooldown)

## Week 3: Musculoskeletal Fitness

* The more force a muscle can generate, the fewer times it can do so before fatigue. These are type 2 or fast twitch muscles.
* The more endurance a muscle has, the less force it can generate. These are type 1 or slow twitch muscles.
* Strength training (especially initially) comes from increased coordination from nervous system, later hypertrophy allows progress to continue.
* Weight/reps doesn't really matter to elicit muscle growth, the key is degree of effort. As long as you work to fatigue, it doesn't matter how you get there. This is more efficient, but suboptimal. Note: going beyond 30 reps means you should be at a higher resistance.
* We have protein turnover in the muscles, with damaged things being broken down and new things being built up.
* Creating a positive net protein balance helps ensure build up overcomes muscle breakdown.
* Best to get steady doses over the 24 hours following workout. Shoot for about 1.6g/kg/day.
* Key areas to focus on: upper body push, upper body pull, core, legs
* Consider working from more complex movements that recruit more muscle groups to more isolated.
* Beginner: squat, push up, pull up, plank
* First set does the brunt of the work, but as you get stronger consider working toward 3 sets for more optimal gains.
* FITT principle: Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type
* Frequency, Intensity, and Time are the most important. Type matters less as long as you are doing something consistently.

## Week 4: Combining Cardio and Strength Fitness

* 5BX - outdated, but combines cardio/strength
* Tabata - 20s on, 10s off, repeat several times
* 7 minute workout
* Key Principles of good strength+cardio combination workouts
  * Combination training - bodyweight at high frequency with little breaks
  * Variation - move between different excercises to avoid overstressing particular areas
  * Effort - move rapidly with little rest, should be 8 or 9 out of 10 difficulty
  * Progression - should change exercises to become progressively more difficult
  * Combination of leg, push, and pull exercises.
* Exercise breaks allowed for more sustained focus in students.
* Top 10 Hacks
  * Put it in Your Calendar - schedule it
  * Exercise with Music
  * Exercise outside, in Nature
  * Find a Buddy
  * Focus on Your Favorite Exercises
  * Mix it Up
  * Effort is Important
  * Consider Tracking
  * Make Exercise Social
  * Do Something, Specifics Don't Matter as Much
