# Hacking Exercise for Health. The surprising new science of fitness.

## Week 1: Basics of Fitness

* cardiorespritory fitness - ability to move oxygen through the body
* musculoskeletal fitness - strength/endurance/power from progressive muscular overload
* exercise continuum - strength (low rep, high intensity) to endurance (high rep and/or high duration)
* we respond to stress by adapting in a way that will reduce the amount of stress we would have if this same stress recurred
* In order to increase strength, probably need to do greater than 60% 1 rep maximum
* Studies indicate that most benefit comes from first set (both cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal), more sets are needed to maximize but one set can be used as an optimization.
* Main hack: do something, as the first part gives the majority of the benefit

## Week 2: Cardiorespiratory Fitness

* vo2max is measure of how much oxygen you breath in vs how much you breath out (ie how efficient you can excange oxygen)
* Rockport walk test:
  * male vo2max = 145.486 - (0.388 * age) - (0.077 * weight in lbs) - (3.265 * time to walk a mile in minutes) - (0.156 * heart rate after walk)
  * female vo2max = 139.168 - (0.388 * age) - (0.077 * weight in lbs) - (3.265 * time to walk a mile in minutes) - (0.156 * heart rate after walk)
* common recommendation is 150 minutes of moderate intensity steady state (not quite breaking a sweat, able to speak, but not sing)
* HIIT: many different regimes, but focus on high intensity for short burts, rather than steady state
* one minute workout: 3 hard 20 second sprints within 10 minutes
* endurance training would deplete energy reserves over time
* interval training depletes energy reserves at a higher rate by recruiting both fast and slow twitch muscles, which seems to have a comparable impact
* endurance burns more calories during exercise, but fewer afterward during recovery. interval burns fewer during exercise, but more afterward. Between the two, similar burns result over the course of the day.
* HIIT protocols from research (easiest to hardest)
  * interval walking - easier 3 minute walk, then harder 3 minute (about 3/10 difficulty), repeate 10x (60m)
  * 10x1 - minute of hard effort, minute of rest, repeat 10x (20m)
  * 1 minute workout - 20s intense, 3m steady, repeat 3x (~10m + warmup&cooldown)
