# The Surprising Science of Meetings

* Ideal venue to bring together ideas, thoughts, and opinions - so that everyone can work in a more coordinated and cooperative manner.
* Meetings help employees connect, voice their opinions, tackle problems, and create shared understanding.
* Meeting build commitment to goals, initiatives, and broader aspirations which may not be stated in individual job descriptions. Employees can also see they are part of something bigger than themselves.
* Meetings bring people together, gain input, promote discussion, promet synergy, provide voice, explain things, coordinate, foster ownership, and learn and grow as a unit. Bringing people together as a coherent whole, helps them be more adaptive, resilient, and self-directing, especially in the face of crises.
* Holding too few meetings robs employees of inclusion, support, voice, and community.
* Allow attendees to interpersonally connect, building relationships, networks, and most importantly, support.
* Poorly conducted meetings are a form of preventable time theft.
* Provide adequate training to those both in and not in leadership already. Consider simulation, similar to what is available in some academic programs and online.

## Summary

* Small, positive changes can lead to palpable gains over time.
* As a leader, if you visualize the meeting, flow, key needs, and key challenges in advance, you will improve the chances of ultimate success. Alternatively/additionally, consider "premortem" to help guide preperation.
* Good meeting design requires a host of decisions, which should be purposely made, rather than decided out of habit and tradition.
* Ask attendees for input on the agenda to increase specificity and also accountability.
* Determine how many people are needed, then provide nonessential personnel other more appropriate opportunities to be involved.
* Leader manages crucial meeting dynamics: engaging all attendees, asking the right questions, modeling active listening, drawing out input, playing traffic officer, and managing emergent conflict.
* As meetings can be experienced as interruption, work to promote positivity from the moment attendees arrive.
* Offer purposeful opening statements, offer appreciation for attendees work and contributions, and remind attendees of "meeting values".
* Periodically evaluate regular meetings.
* Meetings, like many things, should follow an arc of try, reflect, and learn. This also communicates willingness to experiment, take risks, and grow.

## Good Meeting Leadership

* Most people likely overestimate their meeting leadership skills.
* Leaders need meeting skill and facilitation training to understand what excellent meeting behavior looks like and foster self-awareness.
* Leaders need ongoing feedback to continue to improve. Look to include in employee engagement surveys and 360-degree feedback surveys.
* Leaders should evaluate their standing meetings at least once per quarter, likely via survey.
* Leaders should aspire to servant-and-giver mindset, truly owning others' experiences of the meeting, and recognizing their responsibility to make meetings a good use of time.
* Make increasing meeting leadership an organizational priority (don't try to make these improvements alone).

## Meeting Duration

* We often default to 30 or 60 minute meetings regardless of need, and resulting meetings tend to grow to fill the allotted time (Parkinson's Law).
* Organizations can override the 30/60 minute defaults with their own standards (ie 25/50 minute meetings in gcal).
* After choosing an appropriate duration, consider cutting an additional 5-10%. This applies eustress, helps keep things focused, facilitates transitions, etc.
* Don't shy away from unusual durations, if that is the right fit for the discussion at hand.
* Never be afraid to end early if goals have been met, or the meeting is no longer productive (in the later case, stopping and regrouping later or in another medium may help).
* Sometimes 10-15 minute meetings can be an effective way to quickly debrief or reflect.
* Brief huddles can be used to strategize, discuss, monitor, motivate, or celebrate. This is not to report to the leader, but instead for team members to communicate with one another, pull together, learn together, and seek ways to support each other.
* Huddles often set the table for other, deeper conversations

## Meetings as Events

* Agendas are unlikely to make a difference on their own, particularly when recycled from meeting to meeting.
* Meetings are events, and should be planned as such, carefully considering details, flow, experience, and approach.
* Start by considering what needs to be accomplished for a meeting to be successful, it should require genuine interaction among and engagement from attendees (else another medium would likely be more efficient).
* Soliciting agenda input from atteendees and interested parties helps ensure critical topics are covered and helps build buy-in/engagement (likely solicit via email 3-5 days in advance). It may also help to ask for reasoning around why something should be included.
* After identifying potential topics and goals, carefully reflect on goals and decide what adds value beyond it's opportunity cost, dropping anything that doesn't make the cut. Also drop content that is only relevant to a subset of attendees (this content is best pursued in a different context).
* Delegating responsibility, such as by giving certain agenda items owners (in charge of discussion, and often post-meeting action) fosters accountability and distributes load.
* Seek to distribute final agenda 2-3 days in advance, cancelling at this time if you don't have compelling topics.
* Focus agendas around questions, rather than statements.

## Meeting Flow

* Items earlier in the agenda tend to get more time and attention, so front load the most critical items.
* End agenda with few minutes of wrap-up to cover meeting takeaways, clarify assignments, and note agenda items for next time. Occasionally ending with Q&A can also be helpful.
* You may want to group certain related items to tell a better "story".
* All else being equal, prioritize employee-generated/submitted agenda items to send a strong message around voice, inclusion, and shared ownership.
* Meeting should start on time and follow agenda, but sometimes "warm-up" items (ie quick announcements, updates from last meeting) can buffer late people and/or build momentum.

## Dividing up Meetings

* It can be helpful in ideation to use subteams to discuss, generate ideas, and draft preliminary solutions. A representative can then report back (with representative role rotating).
* Intervals can be helpful, with a short meeting, followed by a set time to async contribute, then after someone cleans/condenses the document voting on most promising ideas, a meeting to discuss top candidates, and a final round of voting on the best solution.
* Breaking meetings into two or more smaller parts can lead to higher-quality outcomes by counteracting a tendency toward premature consensus (as attendees often rally around the first reasonable solution/ideas generated).
* One good way of breaking up meetings to to have one meeting to discuss alternatives and another to make the decision.

## Meeting Size

* As meeting size grows, so do coordination challenges, and the probability of social loafing.
* Reducing meeting size can improve quality, and help prevent the erosion of engagement suffered by individuals who must attend irrelevant meetings.
* Start with the meeting goals, and consider: Who has info/knowledge about topics? Who are key decision makers and stakeholders? Who will need the information that is discussed? Who will implement or act upon decisions?
* Seek to have the leanest meeting possible given the goals at hand.
* For decision-making and problem-solving, seven or fewer is ideal (8-12 with outstanding facilitation).
* For idea generation, agenda setting, and huddles, fewer than fifteen is ideal.

## Inclusion without Attendance

* You could split up the agenda to allow multiple smaller, focused meetings.
* You could do time blocks with some attendees joining/leaving at certain times. For instance, initial items relevant to a large group, with many leaving before moving to more focused content.
* You could gather input before the meeting, in lieu of attendance.
  * Survey individuals in advance about topics to be discussed to get ideas about additional topics or their reactions to existing topics. Responses can be shared with and/or discussed by attendees.
  * Asking for input, even if none is subsequently provided it engenders feelings of support, buy-in, and inclusion.
  * Make it clear that even if they aren't an attendee now, they could be in the future.
* You could consider "representative voices" approach in which individuals are explicitly asked to represent groups of stakeholders. In this case, the representative should meeting with their group before hand, and keep them in the loop afterward.
  * Explicitly being assigned a role resulted in more commitment to action.
* Take detailed meeting notes to help attendees remember, recognize that what was said was heard correctly, and promote post meeting actions. Additionally, these can be shared with non-attendees to further foster inclusion.

## Breaking Rhythms

* Be wary of rituals becoming ruts, leading to stagnation.
* Trying new things conveys that you care and value controlled risk-taking and experimentation.
* Seating charts tend not to change, and can impact effectiveness, critical decision-making, creativity, enjoyment, and energy. Fluidity over time can allow you to experience the full range of possible dynamics.
* Walking meetings can change things up for small group discussions which do not need technology to drive the agenda.
* Standing meetings take about 34% less time than sit down meetings without impacting quality.

## Setting a Positive Tone

* Be a source of positive energy.
* Be a good host. Greet attendees, make introductions, point out common interests. The early social interactions you encourage and promote as leader influence the remainder of the meeting.
* Meetings are often experienced as an interruption, so to have a good experience, start by creating separation.
* Begin with passion, enthusiasm, vision, and direction. Make it clear why the attendees are there and what needs to get done.
* Consider 1-2 minutes of recognition, celebration, and appreciation (ideally collective accomplishments, though individual can be ok).
* Alternatively, ask each attendee to: recognize someone (or a group) who has helped them since the last meeting, recognize achievement/accomplishment of another person since last meeting. Just be sure to change up the prompts to keep things fresh/interesting.
* Positive mood states promote individual cognitive flexibility, resilience, well-being, and even creativity. The collective mood state also matters.
* Meeting with more humor and laughter have a greater propensity for socioemotional communication, constructive conversations, and novel solutions.
* Periodically a reminder of "meeting values" can also help create separation.
* Alternatively, you can ask attendees what expectations of norms/behaviors they would like to see from you as leader or others.
* Engagement Ideas: offer food, bring toys, establish technology policies, consider clicker quizzes, consider role playing beyond just devil's advocate, get attendees talking in pairs, consider stretching.

## Integrating Silence

* It is sometimes helpful to utilize silence in meetings, especially when generating and evaluating ideas.
* To be effective a meeting must tap into each attendee's relevant and critical knowledge, insights, and perspectives. Unfortunately by default, meetings tend to be dominated by shared information.
* Non-talking outperforms brainstorming:
  * Attendees can work in parallel, thus removing "production blocking" caused by only one person speaking at a time.
  * When silently writing ideas, attendees do not fear social humiliation (especially when anonymized).
  * Silent writing expects everyone to participate, reducing social loafing.
* Brainwriting
  * Attendees respond to a prompt with each idea on a piece of paper, submitted to the middle. If/when people run out of ideas, they can pull from the middle for possible inspiration.
  * Facilitator(s) sort the ideas into conceptually similar groups (during or possibly after idea generation meeting).
  * Group can then discuss which of these grouped ideas to discuss and flesh out in this or future meetings, or leaders can use voting to narrow down groups if there are too many.
  * Can expand on this by posting ideas and allowing written comments/thoughts/responses as well.
* Silent Reading
  * Well suited for agendas involving a proposal of an idea, concept, or initiative.
  * Reduces the influence of flash, personality, and speaking talent.
  * Demands presenter to think deeply and cogently about proposal before using other's time.
  * Reading generally followed by a vigorous discussion.
  * Generally senior managers hold comments until hearing from others to prevent prematurely swaying discussion.

## Phoning In

* Consider asking permission to be "taskmaster", firmly keeping conversation on track and calling on people as needed.
* Use people's names as much as possible, actively manage conversation flow, and draw remote attendees in.
* Try to direct questions and comments to specific individuals.
* The more anonymous individuals are, the more likely they are to social loaf.
* Assuming each attendee is truly needed, lack of complete engagement by remote attendees is clearly counterproductive.
* Consider "banning" the mute button, as with it multitasking becomes almost a foregone conclusion.
* Use chat so attendees can notify if they want to speak or if you missed something.
* Periodically follow up with attendees to get suggestions for further improvement.
* Try to find additional opportunities for attendee face time with each other to build trust, foster connections, promote empathy, learn from others, and understand humor styles.
