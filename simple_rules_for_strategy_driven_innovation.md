Simple Rules for Strategy Driven Innovation

# Module 1: Course Overview

# Module 2: Strategy in Real Time

## 2.1 Introducing Strategy

Strategy as structured chaos.

* More uncertain environments should have simpler strategies
* Time is central to strategy, with longer time horizons, a focus on rhythm over speed, and attention to time-related metrics
* organization drives strategy

* video game strategy - play the game and strategy becomes apparent
* velcro organization - known/knowable current state (ie open vs closed) and quick to change

## 2.2 Strategy as Simple Rules

### Best Practices

* Focus on bottleneck strategic process and a few simple rules.
* Success is driven by more information, not less
* Business unit teams are central to success
* Innovation AND efficiency

### Simple Rules Examples

* Big Pharma - R&D
  * clear ranking of molecule types as research priorities
  * maximum number of types pursued at one time
  * projects "killed" according to step charts
* Internet Venture - Product Development
  * Always maintain "signature" look
  * Release products in 3 stage quiet launch
  * All developers can work on all products
  * Strict development priorities

### Read Intro + Chapter 1

### Simple Rules

* Simple rules are simple -- just a handful (6 or less, 2-3 ideally)
* Unique to the person and situation
* Relate to a specific activity, not generalities

### Coldplay Rules

Always keep working, record everything lest it be forgotten, limit interviews.

Seems to work for them, though perhaps not sustainably. Allows focus on the music instead of things that might be distracting.

### Read Chapter 2 & 3

## 2.3 Strategy in Real Time

### Types of Rules

* Boundary - Which opportunities to pick
* Priority - Preferred opportunities (harder)
* Stopping - When to quit (hardest)
* How-to - How to proceed & what to do
* Coordination - How to work w/others
* Timing - When to proceed (harder)

### Simple Rules in Your Situation

1. Identify key strategic processes in your own situation, and pick 1 to focus on. In 2-3 sentences give us some background on the context you are working on and the strategic process you chose to focus on.

When we gather, we use unconferences as a means of surfacing latent ideas and connecting with one another. Our unconferences start with colleagues submitting topics, use voting to select topics to be discussed, and provide some rules to guide the discussion. We have carefully iterated to strong core rules, but room for improvement remains.

2. What are the simple rules of your focal strategic process (selection rules, priority rules, process rules, exit rules, etc)? Talk to a few colleagues to see which the simple rules they identify for that strategic process.

Topics are suggested by colleagues, de-duplicated by organizers, and then colleagues vote to determine the final schedule.

Within each topic, participants are asked to solicit a facilitator, notetaker, and timekeeper.

Participants are asked to participate actively, with full attention, or migrate to a different topic. They are also instructed to raise one hand to add to a topic or two hands to change topics.

Facilitators are asked to start by soliciting background and goals. They are asked to call on participants, preferring to stay on the same topic. They are also told to ask non-active participants for comments and questions. Finally, they are asked to be assertive in reiterating any broken rules.

Notetakers are told to expect not to be active participants, to capture highlights rather than the whole conversation, and to share their notes with everyone afterward.

Timekeepers are asked to watch the clock, announcing when the session is half over and when only 5 minutes remain. In the final five minutes, they are asked to direct participants to reflect, summarize the discussion, then clarify next actions and actors.

3. Now that youâ€™ve identified the simple rules, try to evaluate their effectiveness. Are there too many rules or too few? Are these the right rules or the wrong ones? Are you missing any types of rules?

I think they are pretty good overall, but there is always room to improve. Although there are a lot of rules in total, they are divided across different roles so that each individual only needs to worry about roughly 3-5, which feels manageable still. The overall flow of the event has been good, and the feedback has been quite positive, but I think we could still improve a few sub sections.

I'm not sure the facilitator has the right rules to help them draw in non-active participants yet, nor to recognize when particular voices are dominating too much. There might be value to suggesting a prioritizing rule to prefer less-active speakers, in addition to preferring existing topic continuation. Similarly, it might help to have a stopping rule relating to when a particular topic has run it's course or when a particular speaker is being too dominant and/or repetitive in their points.

Reflecting on this, it also strikes me as a bit odd for the wrap-up to fall to the timekeeper. I think I made that choice in the interest of keeping the total number of rules per role small, but it really feels like something that would make sense as a mix of things for the notetaker to ensure the record aligns with what people believe they said and heard.

## 2.4 Three Steps to Simple Rules

### Three Steps to Simple Rules

1. Determine primary objective (what you want more of or less of)
2. Find the bottleneck to achieving that objective?
3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck, sources for ideas:
  * Get expert advise, may help but probably not tailored to your context
  * Analyze your own data/history
  * Advise from friend's and peers

### Bottleneck Examples

Misc notes:

* Initial rules may be insightful, but often may target hard to get metrics. If so, may need to seek out different ways or proxies to these metrics.

### Developing Simple Rules Exercise

Boundary/Priority/Stopping/How-to/Timing

1. What is your primary objective?

Break down knowledge silos by capturing tribal knowledge, seeking and sharing perspective.

2. What is the bottleneck to achieving that objective?

Getting teams to consistently take time away from execution to record their knowledge, especially as they may not directly see the value this provides.

3. Craft rules that address the bottleneck.

Boundary:
Decisions should be recorded in detail if:
* There are stakeholders outside your team.
* It will take days or weeks to execute.
* It will be costly to reverse the decision.
Priority:
* Decisions should be recorded prior to execution and shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback.
* Prefer choices that provide clearer metrics, and which have high learning to cost ratios.
Stopping:
* Decision making and recording are distinct from planning and prioritization. If a decision is de-prioritized, it should be set aside until we agree to work on it.
* Feedback should be solicited with a deadline in order to keep things moving, and if the deadline is missed different collaborators should be sought.
How-to:
* Capture at least NABC: the (N)eed to be addressed, the (A)pproach, the (B)enefits, and the (C)ompetition/alternatives.
* Get at least one additional stakeholder to review the document to provide feedback and perspective.
* Share the final document in a shared central repository so others can find and learn from it.
Timing:
* Ask collaborators to provide feedback within 3 business days, and failing a prompt response solicit different collaborators in order to keep things moving.
* One month after a decision was made, it should be revisited to consider what we may have missed, what we learned in the mean time, and how we can make better decisions in the future.

### Feedback on Exercise

Keep your objective clear and measurable. For example, what knowledge do you hope to capture and how will you know if you did? What perspectives do you seek, how will they be shared and how will you determine if this activity was productive? Include a timeframe for you endeavor (even if ongoing) so you know when to review your solution for efficacy. As you develop your objective, it is important you consider how you will measure success (what metrics will be used)?

Time management is not a bottleneck. When you identify bottlenecks, be specific. Think of this analogy, the hiring process is a problem. What aspect of the hiring process? Does it take days to get the position posted on a job board? Does Human Resources (HR) take an inordinate amount of time to create the job description, is the vetting process to develop a short list of candidates too involved, does panel review coordination create delays, or are there other issues. As you look for bottlenecks, be specific. If time is a zero sum game, what do you want them to give up (cease doing) so they can record their knowledge?  Do they know what knowledge you want them to impart and in what order?

There should be continuity among the objective, bottleneck and solution with the later removing the bottlenecks and moving towards the objective. As you look at your solution, do you believe it will lead to your objective? As you craft your solution avoid ambiguity and interpretive language. For example, "Decisions should be recorded in detail if:...", what decisions, all decisions or are there parameters that guide which decisions should be recorded? Recorded how and under what parameters? Think of it this way, do two people tell of the same experience the same way? You want to make sure they are recording what you desire.

As you examine your solution, look at the order. For example, the "NABC" instruction appears as more of a boundary than a how to, but since the process you are recording is not clear, I may be wrong. The solution appears to be focused on "decisions", but the objective is about capturing knowledge and gaining perspective. I'm not sure how your solution will achieve this goal.

The stopping mechanism should act as a review process for your solution. Is the solution addressing some of the bottlenecks but not all,  are parts of the solution being misinterpreted, perhaps driving activity based on incorrect inputs, or other issues? The stopping mechanism you include is more priority or boundary related. The thoughts and questions are for your consideration and do not require a response, but if you do have any questions or further discussion or clarification points, feel free to contact me by submitting questions to the course forum, or by email at ask-the-professor-innovation@lists.Stanford.edu.
