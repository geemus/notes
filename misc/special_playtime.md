# Special Playtime

* Regular play following the child's lead, ideally at least 5-10 minutes at the same time daily.
* Focus on age-appropriate toys or activities that encourage creativity, and ensure there are enough toys for you to play along.
* Used in Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)

* DON'T: ask questions, give commands, use negative talk or criticism, teach specific lessons
* DO: Play! and work on: praise, reflect, imitate, describe, and enjoy (PRIDE) skills.

## PRIDE skills

* Praise: give labeled, specific praise for positive behaviors. Boost self esteem and encourage more positive behaviors.
* Reflect: repeat or paraphrase appropriate talk. Allows the child to lead the conversation and shows you are listening.
* Imitate: copy appropriate play in the same space as your child. Show you are really listening and model active listening.
* Describe: describe what your child is doing in as much detail as possible. Demonstrate that they have your attention and model language use. Can also help them understand and deal with feelings.
* Enjoy: smiles, enthusiasm, imagination, playfulness, etc. Let them know you are enjoying things and they will enjoy them more as well.
