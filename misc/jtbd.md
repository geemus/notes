# Jobs-to-be-Done

* A framework for defining, categorizing, capturing, and organizing customer's needs.
* Principles: jobs are processes, jobs have a universal structure, jobs are separate from solutions, and jobs are stable over time.
* The goal of any product is helping get core functional jobs done better and more cheaply than competing solutions.

* The customer's job-to-be-done that is pertinent to a company is dependent on that company's business objectives.
* The user of a product is the only person capable of providing the inputs needed for product innovation.

## Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) - JTBD Theory in Practice

1. Define the market and "job-to-be-done" broken down as a job map.
    * Define the Core Functional JTBD - What are you trying to accomplish? What underlying process are you trying to execute?
        * "When trying to (verb + object), in this situation (contextual clarifier)."
    * Define outcomes - What makes getting this job done in this situation time consuming, inefficient, unpredictable, inconvenient or difficult?
        * "People struggle to... (direction + metric + object)"
    * Define emotional jobs - When getting this job done, how do you want to be perceived by others and how do you want to feel or avoid feeling?
        * "And want to feel and be perceived as... (emotion + context)"
    * Build a job map (see 'Job Map' below)
2. Uncover the customer's "needs" = customer-defined performance metrics tied to steps in job map making value creation measurable, controllable, and predictable.
    * Within the job map, you can discover metrics for success for each step, referred to as "desired outcomes".
    * Desired outcome statements are devoid of solutions, stable over time, measureable, controllable, structured for reliable prioritization in a quantitative customer survey, and are tied to the underlying process (or job) the customer is trying to get done.
    * Typically there are 50-150 outcomes per core functional job and 10-30 outcomes per relevant consumption chain job.
    * Desired Outcome = "direction of improvement + performance metric (usually time or likelihood) + object of control (the outcome) + contextual clarifier (describing context in which outcome is desired)"
3. Quantify the degree to which each need is under/overserved: predictive data = discover where it can be done better, discover where it can be done cheaper, quantify degree of over/underserving, and determine strength/weaknesses of competing solutions
4. Discover hidden segments of opportunity = discover key variables, create clusters/segments, profile segments (from profile data in survey)
    * Utilizes likhert surveys for each outcome similar to:
        * "When [job step], how important is it to you that you are able to: [outcome]"
        * "When using [solution] how satisfied are you with your ability to: [outcome]"
        * "How much value is derived from accomplishing [job step]?"
5. Market Strategy = Align existing products with market opportunities (see also 'Growth Strategy Matrix'  below)
    * Align current offerings with outcome-based segments
    * Communicate the strengths of those products to customers in the target segment
    * Include an outcome-based value proposition in those communications
    * Build AdWords around unmet needs
    * Assign leads to ODI-based segments
    * Arm the sales team with effective sales tools
6. Product Strategy = Conceptualize new products to address unmet needs
    * Borrow features from other company offerings
    * Accelerate offerings in the product pipeline and R&D
    * Partner with or license from other firms
    * Acquire another firm to fill a gap
    * Devise a new feature set
    * Design new subsystems and/or ancillary services
    * Conceptualize the ultimate solution which gets the entire job done on a single platform

## Job Map

* A job map does not show what the customer is doing (a solution view); rather, it describes what the customer is trying to get done (a needs view).
* Job maps look at a core functional job as a process and break it down into steps to define vision and direction, discover opportunities, and guide customer needs gathering.

| Step | Customers... | Verbs | Innovate by... |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- | -------------- |
| 1: Define | determine goals and plan resources | plan, select, determine | simplify planning |
| 2: Locate | gather information and items needed to do the job | gather, access, retrieve | make required inputs easier to gather and ensure they are available when/where needed |
| 3: Prepare | set up environment to do the job | setup, organize, examine | make set up less difficult and create guides to ensure proper set up |
| 4: Confirm | verify readiness to perform job | validate, prioritize, decide | give information needed to confirm readiness |
| 5: Execute | carry out the job | perform, transact, administer | prevent problems or delays |
| 6: Monitor | assess whether job is being successfully executed | verify, track, check | link monitoring with improved execution |
| 7: Modify | make alterations to improve execution | update, adjust, maintain | reduce need to make alterations and number of alterations |
| 8: Conclude | finish the job or prepare to repeat it | store, finish, close | simplify the process of concluding |
| Troubleshoot | how to resolve problems when they arise || make it easier to determine a resolution, limit blast radius, make it easier to know when a problem is fixed, and prevent problems at each step |

## Measure Customer Progress

* Measure whether the customer is:
    1. Hiring our solution to get their job done.
    2. Able to complete their job well.
    3. Deriving value by completing their job using our solution.
* Formulate improvement hypothesis of the form: "We believe that [type of customers] will be more successful while doing [job to be done] when we enable [outcome] by improving [functionality]. We expect to see [success criteria] as evidence of this improvement."

## Glossary

### Statement Syntaxes

* Job statement = verb + object of the verb (noun) + contextual clarifier
* Desired outcome statement = direction of improvement + performance metric (usually time or likelihood) + object of control (the outcome) + contextual clarifier (describing context in which outcome is desired)

### Customers

* Job executor - person using the product to get the core functional job done.
* Product lifecycle support team - people who install, transport, repair, maintain, upgrade or dispose of the product.
* Buyer - person responsible for making the financial purchase decision.

### Growth Strategy Matrix

||||
|---|---|---|
| get job done better | differentiated strategy (win underserved only) | dominant strategy (win all customers) |
| get job done worse | discrete strategy (win customers with limited options | disruptive strategy (win overserved and nonconsumers) |
| | charge more | charge less |

### Types of Jobs

* Core functional job - underlying process the job executor is trying to get done in a given situation.
* Related jobs - additional functional jobs the job executor is trying to get done before, during, or following the execution of core jobs.
* Emotional jobs - how the job executor wants to be perceived or feel when executing the core functional job.
* Consumption chain jobs - jobs that the product lifecycle support team is trying to execute such as installation, set up, storage, transportation, maintenance, repair, cleaning, upgrading, and disposing of the product.
* Purchase decision job - job the purchase decision maker executes when using a financial lens to decide which product or service to acquire.

### Useful Metrics

* Net Promoter Score (NPS) - measure customer loyalty, calculated for different groups of users.
* Net Adoption Score (NAS) - measure of product usage patterns, such as license utilization, messages sent, active use, etc. Categorizes customers into adoption cohorts.
* Time spent using feature - measures engagement
* Number of clicks on page - measures engagement
* Monthly or daily active users - measures adoption and engagement
* Number of minutes spent on a job - measures engagement and efficiency
