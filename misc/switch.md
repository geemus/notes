# Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard

## Direct the Rider

- Follow the Bright Spots - Investigate what’s working and clone it.
- Script the Critical Moves - Don’t think big picture, think specific behaviors.
- Point to the Destination - Change is easier when you know where you’re going and why it’s worth it.

## Motivate the Elephant

- Find the Feeling - Knowing something isn’t enough to cause change. Make people feel something.
- Shrink the Change - Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant.
- Grow Your People - Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset.

## Shape the Path

- Tweak the Environment - When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation.
- Build Habits - When behavior is habitual, it’s “free” -- it doesn’t tak the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits.
- Rally the Herd - Behavior is contagious, help it spread.
