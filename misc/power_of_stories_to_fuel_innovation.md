# The Power of Stories to Fuel Innovation

* Stories: move us, teach us, provide an escape, pass tradition, orient us, and define us.
* Stories bring an audience through a journey of connected beginning, middle, and end (though not necessarilly in that order).
* Tactical stories serve a single purpose: illiciting a laugh, instructing, making someone feel better, etc.
* Strategic stories define the essence of something, explaining not just what you is being done, but also why.
* Effective stories provide 2 + 2, but let the listener get to 4 on their own.
* You are rarely the hero, the audience is. Show them how you or your brand can be it's tool.

## Why Stories?

* Stories drive clarity, culture, connection, stickiness, and leadership.
* Story is everywhere. It is as much a way of life as a skill. Spend time learning other stories (to better meet other's needs) and noticing your own. Bank stories.
* Effective stories create a participatory environment with a single focused goal, attention grabbing, engaging story, and enabled action. Seek to transition from advocate to ambassador, by creating contexts that empower the right kinds of stories to occur.
* Creating personal connection makes a story memorable; if it creates real emotion, makes your jaw drop, or is a provocative question, it will get shared. This translates to growth.

* Physiologically - provide a framework for the brain to organize information.
* Psychologically - make people care by helping them see themselves in the story.
* Increase Memory - up to 22x more memorable than facts alone.
* Hold Attention - help hold attention beyond usual drift every ~7 minutes.
* Compassion - "let me tell you a story" slows people down to listen harder, and open up.
* Behavior - Brands described in narrative are evaluated more favorably (vs a feature list), and customers are more likely to buy from brands whose story they believe and resonate with.

## Powerful, Effective Stories

1. Single-Focused Goal - Develop a clear, single, focused goal. There is elegance in simplicity.
  * Human2Human - Focus on who you want to help, rather than jumping to solutions.
  * Actionable - What action must one take to address audience need?
  * Happiness - Ensure the goal is personally meaningful and would bring happiness to you and the audience in some way.
  * Measurable - Identify metrics to help evaluate success/failure. Establish deadlines, celebrate small wins, etc.
  * Clarity - Keep goals focused to increase odds of success and generate momentum. Start with simplest behavior to change at a low cost.
  * Journey - Understand where your audience is now, and where they should be after. What journey should the audience take, and what do you want them to think, feel, or do?
2. Grab Attention - Reverse the rules to grab attention.
  * Hook - What catches you and draws you in? Is it exciting (something you would talk about), engaging (part of the stories of your life), innovative (new things keep happening), enthusiastic (creating differentiated experience), etc
  * Personal - What makes the hook personally resonant?
  * Tone - Pay attention to not just what you say, but also how you say it.
  * Unexpected - People like consuming and sharing new info. Pique their curiosity. Look to reframe the familiar.
  * Visual - Show, don't tell. Photos and videos speak millions of words in seconds.
  * Visceral - Speak to all the senses - sight, sound, hearing or taste.
  * S.T.A.R. - What is the S.T.A.R. (Something They'll Always Remember), the defining moment that people will talk about.
3. Engage - Tell a good (truthful) story.
  * Protagonist - Should be someone knowable and relatable.
  * Arc - Chronology doesn't matter, as long as it has an interesting pattern (like a roller coaster).
  * Credibility - Mix fact and emotion, you can emphasize one or the other, but take care to maintain some balance.
  * Conclusions - The audience will pay closer attention and feel respected if you let them draw their own conclusions.
  * Memorable Story - Find compelling, sticky stories to convey critical information. Less is more, let customers connect the dots. Make sure the protagonist is on a journey.
  * Customer Hero - You and your brand are not the heroes. Your brand helps the customer, the real hero, achieve something. It's that simple.
  * Empathy - As you engage, let your audience engage you. What is important to them? How does that relate to your campaign.
  * Authenticity - True passion is contagious. The more authentic you are, the easier it will be for others to connect with you and your cause. Build common ground by sharing values and beliefs.
4. Enable - Enable others to contribute and choose their own weapon.
  * Co-create - Stories are richer if you enable customers to be a part of them.
  * Share - Design stories for sharability. ie why would someone want to retell? Will they look smart, is it funny, does it spread awe?
  * Vary - Stories should span channels (traditional, hybrid, social, owned), and be retold in the most appropriate way for each channel.
  * Ease - Make it easy for others to act. Prioritize calls to action. Campaigns will be more successful if people understand what you need and can take simple immediate action.
  * Fun - Consider game play, competition, humor, and rewards. Can you engage competitive spirit? Can you make them feel like a kid again.
  * Idiosyncratic - People like programs they perceive are tailored to them (ie speak to their interests) or where they are uniquely advantaged to do well and can have disproportionate impact.
  * Enable - No one should have to ask permission to act. Provide a frame to work within - your point of view and story - and empower them to brieng their effort and unique talents and surprise you.

## Effective Storytelling

* How to coach storytelling:
  * Be curious: Start with open ended questions. Seek to understand what they are trying to communicate, rather than jumping to conclusions. If there are gaps between their intention and your understanding, work together to close them.
  * Don't judge: Look for what you connect with, and build on that.
  * Give thoughtful feedback: Demonstrate attention and interest with thoughtful comments or questions. Mention parts of the story that resonate. Check if you caught the "a ha" moments. Suggest delivery methods that could help audiences further connect.
* How to storyteller's act:
  * Practice "one person/one thought" - make sustained eye contact with an individual (or section of room) while finishing a complete thought, then pick another and repeat.
  * Focus on your presence - What you say is just as important as how you say it, so pay attention to ensure your physical presence matches the emotions you are trying to express.
  * Engage - Involving someone in something active (planting a seed they can return to and watch grow) is far better than giving them something to read. Actively engaged is more likely to be deeply engaged, no matter how small the initial act.

## Banking Stories

* Story is a mindset. The more you think about and share stories, the better you will become at this, so look for opportunities (even outside work). Also ask others for stories to help them get better at it, feel more connected, and contextualize bad events.
* Stories are assets, so you should actively collect them. As you gather stories, think about who you would tell each story to, and when.
* Your stories determine your image and allow you to convey they image you want. Other's stories help us understand how to better meet their needs, sell, and persuade.
* Focus on banking stories which are: True, Bold, Distinct, Relevant, Memorable, Evergreen, and/or Legacy.
* Reflection - Use different techniques to prompt your recollection of stories. Think about stories associated with key people, places or times. Conjure specific emotions and capture stories that come to mind.
* Tracking - As you find a compelling story, write it down. Keep a journal with you or spend time at the end of the day writing down key moments. Write down titles, storyboard structures, and describe how/why to use a story.
* Banking process: brainstorm, iterate, share, edit, bank.
* Story themes: need/action, insight/conflict, POV/solution/event

## Stories as Marketing

* Provides new ways to engage with customers and invite them to be part of your team.
* We need to hear something 3-5 times to overcome skepticism, so create and curate stories worth sharing (the more it is shared, the more people will see it). Also reiterate the story in ways customized to different channels/formats.
* Think about narratives (which don't have an arc/end) and can be populated with many stories.

## Storytelling in Business

* Identify Signature Stories - strategic assets which merit active management
  * Impact and Revenue - can be driven through customer intimacy, operational excellence, innovation, etc.
  * Growth and Innovation - innovation requires new, compelling, and inspiring stories. But you have to bring others along. Stories help employees and customers jump to where you are going by explaining where you are going and why.
  * Trust and Leadership - words seek to cultivate trust, but actions determine it (and can be captured/shared in stories). Stories disproportionately determine the reputation of cultures and leaders.
* Pick the right hero: Brands too often try to be the hero, when the customer should be the hero. Understand their goals and how you will move them along their journey.
* Ensure the story is coherent: how does where you are headed relate to where you came from, and how is this consistent and coherent.
* Stories are a mindset - Cultivate stories, seek connection, and take risks instead of to-dos, hitting numbers, etc
  * Create forums to share stories, and a culture here story is revered. Listen closely, document, and share the stories you hear.
  * Stories are about laughing at mistakes, taking risks, (eventual) success, and transformation.
  * Invite narratives in everything from recruiting, values, operations, etc. All practices reinforce the narrative.
  * Start thinking about what is now, what could be, and utilize story to help others bridge the gap between the two.
* Stories can work against you too: To err is human; mistakes are made; crises do happen.
  * Time is not on your side - In crisis, timing is critical. Don't chase the story, ensure you have considered what you want to say before saying it.
  * Credibility is key - Don't provide an instant response that is unsustainable and/or detrimental. Don't rush to spin for short-term gain and long-term loss. Don't lay the blame elsewhere.
  * Be straight - Say what you know, what you don't know, and what you are going to do to fix the problem. Assume everything will eventually get out -- full disclosure is your friend.
  * Speak to your core audience - Identify core audince and determine what information they want to receive. Align communication channels with how this audience receive information. Use core audience to filter out noise and rebuild credibility with the people that matter.
  * Takeaways: Take control of your story, don't let the press write it for you. Prepare for crisis by building credible, honest and authentic brand. Identify key decision makers. Understand your core audience. Internally understand potential crisis and plan ahead -- timing is critical to recovery.

## Stories in Life

* In life there is both signal and noise, stories provide a means to reduce noise.
* Identify Signature Stories - why hire me, and building trust.
* Power of stories:
  * Story shapes how others see you, whether they want to hire you, whether they want to buy from you, etc. What stories do you tell yourself and what stories do others tell about you?
  * Story is a tool of power. When you share stories, people slow down and listen. Listening draws others to share stories. Consider how often you share stories and how often you listen.
  * Story persuades. Motivating stories can be an asset when advocating. Stories are memorable and persuasive. When you use stories to persuade?
* Utilizing signature stories:
  * Know your signature stories: Write down past, present, and future stories. Look for the through line that connects them to understand objectives and motivations.
  * Know when you are making a change, creating a new chapter. Know why you are making that change. Use story to help others understand where you are going.
  * Don't manufacture your story. It needs to be authentic.
  * Stories don't have to be big and epic. Stories live in small moments and can be told briefly.
  * Make others integral to your stories. The story does not have to be yours.
* What stories are others cultivating? Are you listening hard? Can you help them tell their story?

# M3: Power of Stories

## 3.1 Power of Stories

* Stories are not facts, figures, or lists. But when interwoven it add intellectual pull to the story's emotional pull.
* We only remember 1-10% of what we hear. Stories are up to 22x more memorable than facts.
* We have the same type of neurological response to stories as when we have actual encounters.
* When one group was tasked with happiness and one tasked with meaningfulness, the meaningfulness group was ultimately happier and felt more connected.

### Common Features to Powerful, Effective Stories

1. Develop a clear, single, focused goal. There is elegance in simplicity.
2. Reverse the rules to grab attention. How might others address the challenge? Do the opposite.
3. Tell a good (truthful) story. Tell stories that connect on an emotional level.
4. Enable others to contribute and choose their own weapon.

### Exercise 3.2

#### Stories are not the opposites of data. Data can help your story to be more powerful. Think of a story you want to tell. Please select one of your company stories you wrote about in exercise 2.2. Write down the story, in a few short sentences. What type of data would you collect for your story? Write your story again, but this time incorporate some data in it.

We provide devops to our customers, so that they can focus on how to create their own unique business value. By removing the need to have pagers, it also reduces the number of operations assigned employees and reduces the likelihood of burnout. Furthermore, we are able to hire the best of the best, while most smaller companies cannot.

I think it would be valuable to know how much cost reduction people actually see, and what kind of productivity increase they experience. I'll use some made up numbers in the re-write to try and illustrate.

We provide devops so you don't have to. Our average customer improves their uptime by a whole 9 by switching to our service, while at the sime time freeing up a large portion of 3 or more staff to focus on producing unique business value.


### Exercise 3.2: Try, Fail, Succeed

#### Use the words "Try", “Succeed” and “Fail” (and only these three words) to make three discrete 6-word stories (e.g. try-fail-succeed-try-fail-succeed, or succeed-fail-try-try-try-succeed). The stories could be about anything or anyone- whatever captures your experience or imagination. Then write out the story using full sentences with the words "try", "succeed", and "fail". Last, write down the moral or meaning of the story, or the ‘aha’ of the story.

Try fail try fail try succeed. In trying to engage my colleagues, I began by asking broad questions with little response, then narrow questions with little response, and it wasn't until I moved to one-on-one discussions that I really managed to ask the right kind of questions to get the feedback I needed and wanted. We often don't know what the right solution will be, so by focusing on quick, safe-to-fail experiments we can learn on our way to finding and implementing the right solution.

Try succeed try try try fail. Beginner's luck is great, but it rarely lasts. I'm a big board game player, and sometimes my first play of something seems to be my best, but there is frequently a trough of failure to follow until I'm able to really understand how I did well (and why it worked). We must be wary of hindsight bias tricking us into thinking we understood and made a good choice simply because we succeeded. Instead we need to carefully think about the original decision, process and outcome to understand what correlated and what was causal.

Try fail try succeed try fail. After trying a number of different approaches around recording decisions without much success, I finally started to get traction. Even then, I knew it could be better and continued iterating, even though they weren't always steps forward. Even after we succeed, we should not rest on our laurels, but should continue to explore and iterate, even if/when we still encounter set backs.

# M4: Why Are Stories Important

## 4.1 Shifts in Marketing

* Provide for engaging customers through new means and make customers part of your team.
* Key Changes: explosion of media channels, living in a multiscreen world, every company = media company, stories are social, and stories last forever
* What hasn't changed: time and attention are finite, we love a good story, and content is critical
* Media ecosystem is a mix of traditional (news), owned (company homepage), social, and hybrid (blogs). Can also be looked at as owned, shared, earned, and social.
* We need to hear something 3-5 times to overcome skepticism, so we need to create and curate stories worth sharing (if it gets shared more, people will see it more).
* Sharing content and information builds community and community building enables content sharing. (virtuous cycle)

## 4.2 Why Are Stories Important?

* Story Related Research Findings
  * Helps employees acculturate, improves retention (Brown, 1980)
  * Drives creation of new products (Buckler & Zien, 1996)
  * Re-invigorates companies in decline (McWhinney & Battista, 1988)
  * Attracts new customers & develops loyalty (Sole & Wilson, 2006)
* Physiologically - provide a framework for the brain to organize information.
* Psychologically - make people care, often by seeing themselves in the story.
* Increase Memory - In the average one-minute speech, typical student uses 2.5 stats, only 1/10 a story. Afterward, 63% remember stories, only 5% any statistics. Stories are up to 22x more memorable than facts alone.
* Hold Attention - We drift every ~7 minutes. Stories hold attention.
* Compassion - When you begin "let me tell you a story" -- people slow down. They listen harder, they open up.
* Behavior - Brands are evaluated more favorably when describe in narrative (vs a feature list). Consumers are more likely to buy from a brand whose story they believe and resonate with.
* Corporate stories cultivate trust, inspire and motivate, drive growth and innovation, and increase trust and use of the brand
* Stories drive clarity, culture, connection, stickiness, leadership.
* Brands have transitioned from advocates to ambassadors who create contexts in which they will empower the right kinds of stories.
* Creating a personal connection is what makes a story shareable; if it creates real emotion, makes your jaw drop, or is a provocative question, it will get shared. This translates to growth.

### Exercise 4.1: Your Brand's Media Clover

#### Do a simple search of your brand, what do you find? How much of what you find is traditional, hybrid, owned, social? What are the stories that are being shared? Is it similar across all types of media? What else can you learn about your brand by looking at the results of this search?

Salesforce coverage seems to be dominated by owned and traditional media for business related things (ie the state of our stock, acquisitions, etc). Whereas we also have hybrid and social coverage, which at least presently is focused more around injustice and race. So it does seem that different messages are being focused on/shared in different formats. It also looks like a lot of people are not quite sure what we actually do, which I suppose makes some sense given the breadth of our portfolio and frequent acquisitions.

### Exercise 4.2: The Story You Want to Tell

#### Identify an initiative, project, or product you are working on. There will be exercises to help you develop a story or campaign around it in later modules. For now, write down what that initiative is, and who your audience is. Give some background on the initiative, project, or product. It could be pitching your business to a potential investor, getting buy-in from a boss or a stakeholder within your company, pitching your product/brand to a customer, or a social campaign. You will be completing additional exercises in the next module to develop this into an effective and compelling story.

I want to help move us from an internal, ad-hoc group of architects to a connected community. The architect role is built upon a notion of the value inherent in giving autonomy, but without scaffolding this ended up looking more like isolation. Furthermore, without a stronger sense of consistency, others have a hard time understanding what to expect from architects (and often get different value from different architects). There seems to be fear/resistance to the idea of lost autonomy, but I think this is a false dichotomy. We can set up existing (and new) architects for more success by providing them support and community, and by doing so we will tell a clearer story for how and why others would engage with architects and what they can hope to receive when they do so.

# M5: What Makes a Story Good?

* Is the goal is small enough and clear enough to resonate?
* Make sure you can measure outcomes, so you can know if things are moving in the right direction.
* Iterate by taking your message, testing, tweaking, etc.
* What is you own authentic voice? How can I use it in new and unexpected ways?
* Is the story I'm sharing fresh?
* Carefully architect how people are able to act.

## 5.1 Single-Focused Goal

* Goal is combination of: what destination do you want the audience to reach, what journey do you want them to take, and what do you want your audience to think, feel, or do?
* Goal Design Characteristics (from Dragonfly Workbook)
  * Human2Human - Focus on who you want to help rather than jumping to solutions.
  * Actionable - What action must one take to address audience need?
  * Happiness - Ensure the goal is personally meaningful and would bring happiness to you and the audience in some way.
  * Measurable - Identify metrics to help evaluate success/failure. Establish deadlines, celebrate small wins, etc.
  * Clarity - Keep goals focused to increase odds of success and generate momentum. Start with simplest behavior to change at a low cost.

## 5.2 Grab Attention: Hook and Tone

* Why would the audience want to listen?
* Hook: What catches your attention and draws you in? What is unexpected, how do you keep it energetic?
  * exciting (something you would talk about)
  * engaging (part of the stories of your life)
  * innovative (new things keep happening)
  * enthusiastic (creating differentiated experience)
* Tone: It is not just what you say, but also how you say it.
* Visual design: A picture is worth a thousand words.
* S.T.A.R. Moment: What is the defining moment that people will talk about? (Something They'll Always Remember)
* Grab Attention Characteristics (from Dragonfly Workbook)
  * Personal - What is your personal hook?
  * Unexpected - People like consuming and sharing new info. Pique their curiosity. Look to reframe the familiar.
  * Visual - Show, don't tell. Photos and videos speak millions of words in seconds.
  * Visceral - Design your campaign so that it triggers the senses - sight, sound, hearing or taste. Use music to tap into deep, underlying emotions.

## 5.3 Engage

* Why would the audience want to care?
* Protagonists: Someone knowable, and you somehow can relate to.
* Arc: Chronology doesn't matter. You just want your story to follow an interesting pattern. (like a roller coaster)
* Authenticity: The audience can sense dissonance. Stories should alleviate it. Must believe (and be inspired by) the story. Brands often feel manufactured, people do not.
* Credibility: Stories in business are a mixture of fact and emotion. You need both. You can lean more toward fact or emotion, but have to maintain some balance.
* Audience will pay closer attention and feel respected if you let them draw their own conclusion.
* Engage Characteristics (from Dragonfly Workbook)
  * Tell a memorable Story: Find compelling, sticky stories to convey critical information. Remember less is more, let customer connect the dots. Make sure the protagonist is on a journey.
  * Make the customer the hero: You and your brand are not the heroes. Your brand helps the customer, the real hero, achieve something. It's that simple.
  * Empathy: as you engage, let your audience also engage you. What is important to them? How does that relate to your campaign?
  * Authenticity: True passion is contagious. The more authentic you are, the easier it will be for others to connect with you and your cause. Build common ground by sharing values and beliefs.
  * Media for your message: How we say things can be as important as what we say. Align communication and context.

## 5.4 Enable

* How do you enable the story to grow?
* Co-create: Your story is richer if you enable customers to be a part of it.
* Share: Design stories for sharability. Which is not the same thing as 'virality'. ie why would someone want to retell? Will they look smart, is it funny, does it spread awe?
* Vary: Stories should span channels (traditional, hybrid, social, owned), and be retold in the most appropriate way for each channel.
* Bank: Bank your stories; they are assets.
* As your company grows, so will your stories.
* Enable Design Characteristics (from Dragonfly Workbook)
  * Easy: Make it easy for others to act. Prioritize your calls to action. Campaign will be more successful if people understand what you need from them and can take simple immediate action.
  * Fun: Consider game play, competition, humor, and rewards. Can you engage competitive spirit? Can you make them feel like a kid again.
  * Idiosyncratic: People take to programs that they perceive are tailored to them (ie speaking to their interests) or where they are uniquely advantaged to do well and can have disproportionate impact as a result.
  * Enable: No one should have to ask permission to act. Provide a frame for them to work within - your point of view and story - and empower them to bring their effort and unique talents and surprise you.

### Exercise 5.1: Single Focused Goal

Problem Statement: Architects need to work together because isolation sucks.

Humanistic: What started as autonomy seems to have grown into balkanization. We could use one an other's support and have a lot to learn from one another.
Actionable: Create opportunities to get to know one another, opportunities to collaborate, and opportunities to share.
Measurable: I think we can get a sense of this through using surveys of satisfaction and connected-ness.
Clarity: This is probably still too broad, picking just one area (like more opportunities to collaborate or share), may help.
Happiness: There is a lot of satisfaction in being supported and supporting one another.

### Exercise 5.2: Grab Attention

What is the best way to grab attention? Share specific success stories.

Personal: Use stories that are relatable and have clear positive outcomes.
Unexpected: Find stories that are not usually shared or focused on.
Visual: Include images of people and/or memes to make it more memorable.
Visceral: In the current remote context this is hard (beyond visual), will have to think more on it.

### Exercise 5.3: Engage

Choose a story. Write out key details and inflection points. Make notes on how the campaign's story meets the goal and fits with grabbing attention: I need to find some partners, but I think we can have a real impact on meeting duration and effectiveness (and telling this story would be powerful).

Tell a memorable story: Telling a story of how many fewer meetings people have, how much shorter they are, and how much more highly people rate their effectiveness.
Make customer hero: Empower individuals to improve the meetings they run and participate in through education and tools.
Create empathy: People definitely feel like they have too many meetings, and that they quality is low (but often worry about getting left out or not heard otherwise).
Exhibit authenticity: I definitely have struggled with this and didn't know what to do, and I have been told by many others that they have the same frustrations and don't know what to do about it.
Match media: Probably not yet. I've mostly focused on text-only email, and have really not seen much response. More images and/or video could go a long way to improve things.

### Exercise 5.4: Engage

Feel: Setup for success.
Think: I am empowered to grow my impact.
Do: Learn from the toolkit/materials, provide feedback to drive iteration, and share their stories of success/impact.

Easy: Provide small suggestions for improvement and focus on high leverage interventions (like cutting 5-10% duration from most meetings).
Fun: Keep things light and find ways to help people feel excited to give back time to others by improving meetings.
Tailored: Meet them where they are, learn about where the biggest pain points (and therefore highest leverage) are and address these.
Enable: Provide a catalog of success stories and a library of tools that work in most cases to help educate and get people started on their journey.

# M6: Coke Happiness Machine

## 6.1 The Coke Happiness Machine

* Design thinking approach. Split $350k as 7k to each of 7 groups, 6 failed and one succeeded. Fails around apps/screensavers, success around simple video story.
* What they did: Really had fun with it. Tried to surprise and delight. But did not succeed in making it easy to take action.
* Made customers part of the story. Instead of telling stories, provide tools that allow customers and fans to co-create memories and stories. Focus around philosophy: Story. Spread. Value.
* Think about narratives (which don't have an arc/end) and can be populated with many stories.

### Exercise 6.1: Continue the Happiness

If you were in charge of the Coca Cola Happiness Machine campaign, how would you redesign the campaign to enable action better and to allow other customers or individuals to add to the campaign? Come up with at least 5 different ideas.

1. Offer a buy one get one discounted offer with an encouragement to "share the happiness".
2. Offer a contest where the winner would get a visit from the happiness machine on their campus.
3. Offer materials to create some kind of DIY version of the happiness machine.
4. Add a more explicit ask to the materials, such as suggesting sharing coke with friends.
5. Create some focus around 2-liter product (which is more shareable, and less a single serving) and sharing it with others.

# M7: Applications: How to Make It Work For You

## 7.1 Identify Your Signature Stories

* Create and curate stories worth sharing. The more you think about and share stories, the better you will become at this, so look for opportunities even outside work.
* Ask for stories, ie "tell me one story that happened today", rather than just "what is best, what is worst, etc". People will get better at it, and feel more connected. Also helps people see bad events as part of an arc.
* As you gather stories, think about who you would tell the story to and when.
* 4 rules of storytelling in business:
  * Identify Signature Stories: Strategic asset which merits active management.
    * Impact and revenue: can drive revenue through customer intimacy, operational excellence, innovation, etc.
    * Growth and innovation: innovation requires new, compelling, and inspiring stories. But you have to bring others along. Stories move employees and customers to jump to where you are going by explaining where you are going, and why.
    * Trust and leadership: words seek to cultivate trust, but actions actuall determine this (and can be captured in stories). Stories disproportionately determine the reputation of cultures and leaders.
  * Pick the right hero: Brands too often make the mistake of trying to be the hero, the customer should be the hero. Understand their goals and how you will move them along their journey.
  * Ensure the story is coherent: how does where you are headed relate to where you came from, and how is this consistent and coherent.
  * Stories are a mindset: instead of to-dos, hitting numbers, etc vs cultivating stories, seeking connection, and taking risks.
    * Stories are about laughing at mistakes, taking risks and (eventually) succeeding, and transformation.
    * Leveraging stories in more than ads. It's inviting narrative in everything from recruiting, values, and operations. All practices reinforce the narrative.
    * Start thinking about what is now, what could be, and utilize story to help others bridge the gap between the two.
  * Stories can work against you too: To err is human; mistakes are made; crises do happen.
    * Time is not on your side - In crisis, timing is critical. Don't chase the story, make sure you think through what you want to say before you say it.
    * Credibility is key - Don't provide an instant response that is unsustainable and/or detrimental. Don't rush to spin for short-term gain and long-term loss. Don't succumb to the desire to lay the blame elsewhere.
    * Be straight - Say what you know, what you don't know, and what you are going to do to fix the problem. Assume everything will eventually get out -- full disclosure is your friend.
    * Speak to your core audience - Identify core audience and determine what information they want to receive. Align communication channels to how this audience receives information. Use core audience to filter out noise and rebuild credibility with the people that matter.
    * Takeaways: Take control of your story, don't let the press write it for you. Prepare for crisis by building credible, honest and authentic brand. Identify key decision makers. Understand your core audience. Internally understand the kind of crisis you could face and plan ahead -- timing is critical to recovery.

# M8: Banking Stories

## 8.1 Banking Stories: Why?

* Stories are assets, so you should actively collect them.
* Your stories determine your image and allow you to convey the image you want.
* By understanding other's stories, we can better meet their needs, sell and persuade.
* Focus on banking stories that are: True, Bold, Distinct, Relevant, Memorable, Evergreen, Legacy.
* Story banking -> Brainstorm, share, iterate, share, edit, bank
* Build a personal story bank
  * Two types of personal stories: why hire me, building trust
* Build a company story bank
  * Two types of corporate stories: signature stories, tactical stories
  * Both employee and customer stories.
  * Create forums to share stories, and a culture where story is revered.
  * Listen closely and document the stories you hear.
* Story is a mindset. Always be looking for opportunities to strengthen and collect stories.
* Force yourself to be thinking about stories, even around the dinner table at home.
* Story design: need/action, insight/conflict, POV/solution/event
* Story storage: Storyboard for structure, also capture how and why you use the story

### Exercise 8.1: Telling and Banking Your Own Stories

* Write down (or find a different way to prepare) either your “why hire me story” or your “building trust” story. If you’d like, feel free to write down both stories so that you can bank them for future use.
  * “Why hire me” story: A story that you would incorporate in a job interview or pitch where you would want others to hire you or include you in a project or team.
  * “Building trust” story: A story that you would tell others to make them trust you more (a situation where you made a tough decision, a surprising solution you came up, a relationship you built, etc.).
* Now seek the help of 1-2 friends/colleagues/family members. Simulate an interview session with your friend/colleague for 5-10 minutes and present your “why hire me” or “building trust” story. Ask your “interviewer” to take notes, rate you as a candidate, and provide you with feedback on your story. Try to incorporate this feedback into the second “interview” you have with your other friend/colleague.
* Please submit to the website your story(s), tell us about your simulation experience, and share 3-5 key learnings from the feedback you received.

>  I had a need to write this sort of story for an application for a pre-graduate program. Here is my story:

I love learning, which is fortunate given my talent for acquiring positions in which I feel unprepared to succeed. Whether it be my steadily improving GPA as a first-generation student or my crash course in leading a software development project as the first and only employee at a new startup, I have been able to rely on my curiosity, hard work, and persistence to iterate my way toward success.

As my leadership roles expand I find myself once more upon such a learning precipice. I am working within Salesforce to prepare other software architects for success and to create a sense of unity and coherence that we currently lack across hundreds of architects. Simultaneously I am leading the trustees of our local library as we draft a strategic plan amid the rapidly evolving expectations of libraries. I believe the Foresight Program will provide me with the tools and insight I need to successfully navigate these transitions.

Within Salesforce, I have worked in many disparate areas, often needing to bootstrap and expand my knowledge in order to succeed. For instance, I successfully implemented a decision-making process which helped ensure alternatives were considered, hypotheses were made and tested, and that decisions were able to be reviewed in a way that mitigated hindsight bias. My success has hinged upon researching existing approaches, prototyping changes, testing them, and repeating to continually improve the process. I hope to continue to evolve and expand the adoption of this process through insights gleaned from the Foresight Program and diverse other sources.

Even more directly related to the program, I am one of the administrators of our architecture long-range planning process, which seeks to gather the best ideas to inform where we should go in the coming years. So far this effort has had limited impact, usually seeming to relate more to existing conditions and trends rather than the success of the process itself. I hope to reinvigorate and increase the impact of our long-range planning by incorporating the analysis of external environments and multiple plausible futures I would learn from the Foresight Program.

In pursuit of autonomy, Salesforce architects have been loosely affiliated and largely left to their own devices. This worked well enough with relatively few architects, but as we grow our impact has diminished as architectural practice across the organization becomes increasingly incoherent and inconsistent. The processes I have worked on represent incremental change to address these concerns, but I believe the kind of systemic and transformational change the Foresight Program teaches will be required to reform a sense of unity, build coherence, and increase impact.

As a leader across these contexts, I feel trapped in working incrementally toward an expected future. I hope to utilize the Foresight Program to build upon my foundation of curiosity, love of learning, hard work, and persistence to gain skill in understanding plausible futures to drive the systemic, transformational changes my organizations need in order to continually increase their impact.

> I spoke to both my wife and my manager about the story. They highlighted that initially I did a good job of conveying my need, but not how/why I would succeed. They also pointed out some place where I was too vague and generally that it was still a bit too focused on facts and not a clear enough arc. All of these helped me to refine and update the story to be more compelling (and I had much less new feedback in the second interview). Even before the edits, both suggested they would accept me to the foresight program.

### Exercise 8.2: Banking Your Customer Stories

* Talk to someone who uses your product or service, write down a story told by that person related to your product or service. Also talk to someone who has not used or dislikes your product/service, and write down a story told by them. Do more if you’d like, but submit at least one story of each.

> The general Heroku RFC process has been an inspiration and the basis for the "team local" RFCs. The hardest part of RFCs has been figuring out the right signal to noise ratio, which has led to the "team local" RFCs, but keeping all the things that made them a great idea. Recently, in the languages program we were running into a problem dealing with Pull Requests being reviewed. The reason for this is the program is made up of mostly independent individuals working on different things. Using the RFC process, I was able to frame a problem and propose various solutions and talk about them across the program. Based on feedback, the original proposal has changed from inception. In addition to this, Manuel who is a "recent" hire has loved the process. As a new person, it's been helpful for understanding why the program functions the way it does. People have even used the RFC format just b/c it's a great way to collect their thoughts on their own local problems.

I knew they were a fan and proponent, but I was surprised just how effusive and in how many ways this has worked well for them. It's great to hear and encouraging that this could be more broadly useful.

> I don’t use them because I’m not directly leading any architectural decisions, generally; I just facilitate others doing so (and, like you, I constantly recommend using them).

I suspected this would be the answer I received, and I took the opportunity to clarify that the tools are useful for all decisions, not just architectural ones. That being said, this seems to be a somewhat common refrain, so I need to find ways to better communicate scope and share exemplars. Also, it is a good reminder that I should do more recommendation and advocacy.

# M9: Teaching Others to Tell Stories

## 9.1 How to Teach Story-Telling

* How to listen:
  * Set goals. What are you listening for? Do you want to understand the big "a ha"? Do you want to give feedback on delivery? Are you trying to pick up tips and tricks about telling stories well?
  * Stay engaged. If appropriate, ask questions, take notes, or nod along.
  * Respond thoughtfully. Push yourself to move beyond surface level responses (like nodding head, that's interesting, I see)
* How to set goals:
  * Keep it simple. Maintain a focused single goal. Make it easy to participate.
  * From-to. Don't just know yoru takeaway, know where the audience is now, and where they should be after. Articulate this clearly in one clean sentence.
  * Message sent is not necessarily message received. Make sure you know what message is received.
* How to connect:
  * Rely on emotion: No matter how unique your story, people can understand the emotion. Share how you were feeling to connect people to your story.
  * Show, don't tell: Use language that describes details (smells, colors, thoughts) of an experience. Never explain "this was important to me" or "I felt", if you describe the experience well, the audience will feel what you felt.
  * Be authentic. People can tell when someone is lying or avoiding a topic. Do not be afraid to be vulnerable, figure out what is truly important to you, and share that.
* How to act:
  * Practice "one person/one thought" - make sustained eye contact with an individual (or section of room) while you finish a complete thought, then choose another person/section for the next thought.
  * Focus on your presence - What you say is just as important as how you say it, so pay attention to your physical presence and make sure that it matches the emotions that you are trying to express.
  * Engage - Involving someone in doing something active (planting a seed they can return to and watch grow) is far better than giving them something to read. People who are actively engaged are far more likely to deepen engagement, no matter how small the initial act was.
* How to use visuals:
  * Tell the message with images - Could your piece communicate the message without explanatory titles/phrases, or even dialogue? If there are words, ar they redundant to images? (if so remove redundancy).
  * Avoid over-reliance on the screen - Make eye contact with us instead. If you need to reference slides, do so without turning back on audience.
  * No more than 8 words on a slide - a few words is all a viewer can digest at a time
  * Keep a consistent visual style - don't distract the audience
* How to coach others:
  * Be curious - Begin by asking open ended questions. Try not to jump to conclusions, but instead seek to understand what they were trying to communicate. If there is a gap between their intention and yoru understanding, work together to close it.
  * Don't judge - Never judge the storyteller. Be open minded, look for what you connect with, then build on that.
  * Give thoughtful feedback - Demonstrate you are listening and interested by responding with thoughtful comments or questions. Mention parts of the story that resonate with you. Share your aha moment and check that it is the intended take-away. Suggest delivery methods that could further help audiences connect to the story or speaker.
* How to bank stories:
  * Pay attention - stories are everywhere. If you look for them, you'll find them, and be ready to share them with others. Write down the titles as they come to you.
  * Track - As you find a compelling story, write it down. Keep a journal with you or spend time at the end of each day writing down key moments.
  * Reflect - Use different techniques to prompt you recollection of stories. Think about stroies associated with key people, places or times. Conjure specific emotions and copture stories that are brought to mind.

# M10: Stories in Life

## 10.1 Your Stories

* In life there is both signal and noise, stories provide a means to reduce noise.
* Power of stories:
  * Story shapes how others see you. Rsearch shows stories others tell about you shape how they see you, whether they want to hire you, and whether they want to buy from you. What ar stories you tell yourself and that others tell about you?
  * Story is a tool of power. When you share stories, people slow down and listen to you. Listening draws others to share their stories. Consider how often you share stories and how often you listen.
  * Story persuades. Motivating stories can be an asset when advocating. Stories are memorable and persuasive. When do you stories to persuade.
* Utilizing signature stories:
  * Know your signature stories - the stories you have told and retold and define you. Write down past, present, and future stories. Look for the through line that connects them to understand objectives and motivations.
  * Know when you are making a change, creating a new chapter. Know why you are making that change. Use that why to tell a story to help others understand what you are doing next. Story can help others understand where you are going.
  * Don't manufacture your story. When sharing you need to feel authentic. Others can create noise, and can blur your story.
  * Stories don't have to be big and epic. Stories live in small moments and can be told briefly.
  * Make others integral to your stories. The story does not have to be yours.
* What stories are others cultivating? Are you listening hard? Can you help them tell their story?

### Exercise 10.1 Stories in Life

1. Take 2 minutes to write down titles of the stories that have defined your life.
2. Use the provided Spreadsheet for timeline exercise, and substitute the sample information with your own information, then view the chart that is created. What is the highest point of your life and what is the lowest? Submit your own timeline sheet.
3. Looking at all your stories, what is your throughline?

1. Trenchcoat, College, Quiktron, Principal Financial, ImThere, Plinky, Fog, Engine Yard, Heroku
3. I'm the eccentric one, who is always learning, and seeking to help out.

### Exercise 10.2 Stories Others Tell About You

* Take 2 minutes to write down titles of stories that others tell about you, either in your personal life or professional life.

* Vicious text editor, eccentric, anti-heirarchy/pro-distributed, meta-obsessed, cold/distanced, heavy gamer, father, "chef".

# M11: Wrap Up and Parting Thoughts

## 11.1 Wrap-up

* Remember to give 2 + 2, but let the listener get to 4 on their own.
* Reasons for stories
  * Story is everywhere. It is as much a way of life as a skill. Spend time learning others stories (so you can better meet their needs) and noticing your own. Bank stories.
  * Story is versatile. Can be used for: building culture, advertising, making pitch, managing teams. Test creativity and find innovative ways to use story to move people to action.
  * Story is powerful. Stories are 22x more memorable than facts. Stories engage emotions moving people to action. The key is to figure out how to use it, effectively.
  * Story spans silos. Story is part of the collective experience. Once told, it becomes a living, breathing thing that is spread and shared. Key is to pick and use stories effectively in ways that make it participatory.
  * Story must be consistently varied. Consider how to tell your story across different mediums/channels.
  * Story drives action. If used effectively. Thus, use story like you'r going to create a participatory environment. Create a single focused goal, grab attention, engage through story, enable action.
* Tips to use story effectively
  * Goal. Start with a goal, you need to know the purpose of your story.
  * Hook them. Grab attention with a dramatization, statistics, a stunt, props, repitition. Any S.T.A.R. moment will do.
  * Create an arc. Good stories have an arc which highlights a hero and his struggles to achieve some bigger goal.
  * Be credible. Remember effective stories blend fact and emotion. You need both analytical and narrative components to really have impact. As seen in credibility triangle, too much of one ruins it.
  * Give them 2 + 2. Audience will be more willing to hear the message and retain it if they draw the conclusion.
  * You are rarely the hero. The customer is. Show your audience how you or your brand can be it's tool.
* Final Thoughts
  * Know your signature stories.
  * Bank stories. Look for story in every day.
  * Use story to drive impact - at work and in life.
  * Create participatory environments and invite others to act.
